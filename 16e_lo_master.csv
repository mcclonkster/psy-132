1,I,Introduction,I.1,Why Study Psychology?,I.1.1,Explain how studying psychology will help you in your personal and professional life,"Two broad categories of learning relate to content (that is, the subject matter) and skills. Psychology students learn a variety of skills during their studies, including research skills, critical thinking skills, cultural awareness skills, communication skills, and personal skills. All of these can be useful at work or in your personal life. The study of psychology will also prepare you for many potentially rewarding careers. Some of those exist within the field of psychology, but the skills learned in a psychology degree can also be applied to a wide range of other career paths.",4
2,I,Introduction,I.2,Reflective Reading: How to Tame a Textbook,I.2.1,Describe how you can get the most out of this textbook,"Reflective reading, which involves actively thinking about what is being read, is better than passive reading. Using digital media offers another way to be more reflective about your reading.",6
3,I,Introduction,I.3,Reflective Note-taking: LISAN Up!,I.3.1,Describe how you can get the most out of class time,"Reflective learning in class involves active listening. One way to be a more active listener in class is to follow the five steps of the LISAN method: lead, don’t follow; identify the main ideas; pay attention to signal words; actively listen; engage in good note taking.",7
4,I,Introduction,I.4,Reflective Study Strategies: Making a Habit of Success,I.4.1,Describe how you can best prepare for tests,"More reflective studying involves studying in a specific place, using spaced study sessions, trying mnemonics, testing yourself, and overlearning. Remember that more specialized strategies may be needed for objective tests, essay tests, and short-answer tests. Avoid procrastination through time management, setting goals, and making learning an adventure.",8
5,1,The Foundations of Psychological Science,1.1,Commonsense Psychology: Not Necessarily “Common” or “Sense”,1.1.1,Explain why people fail to recognize that “common-sense” beliefs are often false,"Commonsense beliefs are often false, but people fail to recognize this because they do not tend to evaluate them critically (uncritical acceptance) and because we seek evidence that confirms, and avoid evidence that contradicts, our beliefs (confirmation bias), regardless of the quality of that evidence.",14
6,1,The Foundations of Psychological Science,1.1,Commonsense Psychology: Not Necessarily “Common” or “Sense”,1.1.2,"Distinguish between superstition, pseudoscience, and science",Superstitions are unfounded beliefs that change little over time because they are held without objective evidence or in the face of falsifying evidence. Scientific-sounding superstitions are referred to as pseudoscience. Science requires that we take an objective approach to answering questions using careful observations and experiments.,14
7,1,The Foundations of Psychological Science,1.2,What Psychologists Do,1.2.1,Name some of the areas in which psychological scientists do research,"Some psychologists work primarily as researchers, and psychological research can be basic or applied. Researchers may study animals either because they are interested in animal behavior or because animals provide a model of human behavior. The field of psychology now has dozens of specialties, including developmental, forensic, community, environmental, and industrial/organizational (see Table 1.1).",15
8,1,The Foundations of Psychological Science,1.2,What Psychologists Do,1.2.2,Describe the work carried out by clinical and counseling psychologists,"Some psychologists work primarily as clinicians, helping other people with mental health issues. They often work alongside other mental health workers (e.g., psychiatrists, psychoanalysts, and counselors) whose training and methods differ considerably. Clinical psychologists treat mental disorders and emotional problems; counseling psychologists treat milder problems including difficulties at work or school.",15
9,1,The Foundations of Psychological Science,1.3,The History of Psychological Science: A Trip Through Time,1.3.1,Explain the method that Wundt and Titchener used to study conscious experience and the limitations of this method,"Wilhelm Wundt used introspection (personal observation of mental events) to study conscious experience. His student, Titchener, took these methods to the United States and referred to his approach as structuralism, a kind of “mental chemistry” based on introspection. However, introspection is of limited use as a research method since there is little consistency between the introspective reports of different people and because of the discovery of imageless thought, the finding that people may be subjectively unaware of their own mental processes and the cognitive unconscious.",18
10,1,The Foundations of Psychological Science,1.3,The History of Psychological Science: A Trip Through Time,1.3.2,Contrast Titchener’s structuralist approach to psychology with other approaches,"a. Gestalt (Wertheimer): accepted introspection but argued that psychological events must be studied as whole units rather than broken into components. b. Functionalism (James): emphasized mental processes as a continuous stream and asked how behavior helps us adapt; linked naturally to Darwin’s evolution. c. Behaviorism (Watson, Skinner): rejected introspection; focused on objective behavior, with radical behaviorists rejecting the study of mind. d. Psychoanalysis (Freud): distrusted introspection; emphasized unconscious origins of behavior and interpreting hidden meanings. e. Cognitive approach: studies mental processes more objectively by operationally defining them in terms of measurable behaviors. f. Humanistic (Maslow, Rogers): embraced conscious experience, human potential, and growth; rejected the idea that mental events can be subdivided into basic “building blocks.”",18
11,1,The Foundations of Psychological Science,1.4,Contemporary Psychological Science and the Biopsychosocial Model,1.4.1,Explain the three perspectives that comprise the biopsychosocial model,"The three perspectives include: biological (behavior is the result of biological and evolutionary processes, such as genetics and the nervous system), psychological (behavior is the result of psychological processes, such as thinking and memory), and social (behavior is the result of social contexts, such as culture).",24
12,1,The Foundations of Psychological Science,1.4,Contemporary Psychological Science and the Biopsychosocial Model,1.4.2,Explain the advantages of the biopsychosocial model for explaining complex behavior,"The biopsychosocial model holds that human behavior and mental processes are best understood by combining insights from biology (including biopsychology and evolutionary psychology), psychology (including motivation, thinking, personality, perception, and language), and the social world (including culture, access to education, and poverty). Because it considers the three perspectives simultaneously, it is better able to explain complex human behavior (such as eating disorders) and the full range of human diversity.",24
13,1,The Foundations of Psychological Science,1.4,Contemporary Psychological Science and the Biopsychosocial Model,1.4.3,Explain why early psychological research was prone to gender and culture bias,"Gender bias was inadvertently introduced into psychological research because most early psychologists were Caucasian men, and because the participants in much of the early research were men. Similarly, culture bias stems from an overreliance on research participants who are from WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) societies.",24
14,1,The Foundations of Psychological Science,1.5,The Core Features of Psychological Science,1.5.1,Explain the goals of contemporary psychology,"Psychologists’ goals are description (name and classify behavior through detailed records), understanding (state causes of behavior), prediction (forecast behavior), and control (alter conditions that influence behavior).",28
15,1,The Foundations of Psychological Science,1.5,The Core Features of Psychological Science,1.5.2,"Define critical thinking, and identify the five principles of critical thinking",Critical thinking in psychology is a type of open-minded reflection involving the support of beliefs with scientific explanation and observation. It requires: 1) performing logical analysis/empirical testing; 2) refusing to believe information based on claimed expertise; 3) evaluating the quality of the evidence; 4) evaluating evidence for and against the claim with an open mind; 5) seeking to falsify claims.,28
16,1,The Foundations of Psychological Science,1.5,The Core Features of Psychological Science,1.5.3,Outline the six steps of the scientific method,1) Make observations; 2) Define the problem; 3) Propose a hypothesis; 4) Gather evidence/test hypothesis; 5) Build theory; 6) Publish results.,28
17,1,The Foundations of Psychological Science,1.5,The Core Features of Psychological Science,1.5.4,"Describe three types of data gathered by psychological scientists, including the challenges faced by psychologists who use them","1) Self-report (interviews, tests, questionnaires, surveys): may suffer from unrepresentative samples and socially desirable responding. 2) Observational (naturalistic and structured observation): can be affected by observer effect and observer bias. 3) Physiological (heart rate, brain activity, hormones): often expensive, require specialized equipment, and are indirect assessments of target variables.",28
18,1,The Foundations of Psychological Science,1.6,Experimental Research: Where Cause Meets Effect,1.6.1,"Differentiate between independent, dependent, and extraneous variables in an experiment",Independent variables are controlled by the researcher (participants are randomly assigned to levels) and are considered the “cause.” Dependent variables are measured outcomes—the “effect.” Extraneous variables are other factors that may influence the dependent variable; researchers attempt to hold them constant across groups.,36
19,1,The Foundations of Psychological Science,1.6,Experimental Research: Where Cause Meets Effect,1.6.2,Explain how experiments allow psychological scientists to make statements about cause and effect,Experiments compare groups that differ only on the independent variable. Random assignment promotes group equivalence; extraneous variables are held constant. Differences on the dependent variable can then be attributed to the independent variable.,36
20,1,The Foundations of Psychological Science,1.6,Experimental Research: Where Cause Meets Effect,1.6.3,Outline how psychological scientists evaluate the results of an experiment,Results should be statistically significant (unlikely due to chance). Replication strengthens confidence in findings.,36
21,1,The Foundations of Psychological Science,1.6,Experimental Research: Where Cause Meets Effect,1.6.4,"Describe two problems associated with experiments, and how they can be controlled","1) Research participant bias (e.g., placebo effect): controlled with placebos and single-blind procedures. 2) Researcher bias: controlled with double-blind procedures so neither participants nor data collectors know group assignments.",36
22,1,The Foundations of Psychological Science,1.7,Nonexperimental Research: Losing (a Bit of) Control,1.7.1,Differentiate between quasi-experiments and true experiments,"Both compare groups on a dependent variable, but quasi-experiments lack random assignment (often for ethical or practical reasons), so they cannot establish cause and effect.",41
23,1,The Foundations of Psychological Science,1.7,Nonexperimental Research: Losing (a Bit of) Control,1.7.2,"Explain what is meant by correlational research, and how the degree of association between two variables is assessed in correlational research",Correlational research assesses the degree of association between variables using a correlation coefficient (−1.00 to +1.00). Magnitude reflects strength; the sign indicates direction (positive or negative).,41
24,1,The Foundations of Psychological Science,1.7,Nonexperimental Research: Losing (a Bit of) Control,1.7.3,Describe the conditions under which case studies are useful,Case studies (in-depth analyses of one or a few individuals) are useful for investigating rare events or conditions.,41
25,1,The Foundations of Psychological Science,1.8,Psychology and Your Skill Set: Information Literacy,1.8.1,Name six ways that people can critically evaluate information found in the popular press and on social media,1) Consider the source; read laterally. 2) Beware of poor or cherry-picked information. 3) Consider alternative explanations and chance. 4) Check for control groups in reported studies. 5) Distinguish correlation from causation. 6) Beware of oversimplifications.,45
26,1,The Foundations of Psychological Science,1.8,Psychology and Your Skill Set: Information Literacy,1.8.2,Create a plan to analyze and evaluate information that you are exposed to in the popular press and on social media,Use the suggested steps to evaluate information so you can feel confident assessing what you see and read across sources.,45
27,2,Brain and Behavior,2.1,The Nervous System,2.1.1,Outline the major divisions of the nervous system,The nervous system divides into the CNS (brain for most “computing”; spinal cord linking brain to PNS) and the PNS. The PNS includes the somatic system (sensory input to brain; motor commands to body) and the autonomic system (sympathetic and parasympathetic branches).,54
28,2,Brain and Behavior,2.1,The Nervous System,2.1.2,Identify the important parts of a neuron,Dendrites receive incoming messages; the cell body integrates them; the axon carries impulses away; axon terminals pass signals to adjacent neurons.,54
29,2,Brain and Behavior,2.1,The Nervous System,2.1.3,Describe how neurons operate and communicate with each other,"Neural input at dendrites and soma triggers an electrical action potential that travels down the axon to terminals. Between neurons, communication is chemical: neurotransmitters cross the synapse to receptors, exciting or inhibiting the next cell; neuropeptides modulate synaptic activity.",54
30,2,Brain and Behavior,2.1,The Nervous System,2.1.4,Distinguish between neuroplasticity and neurogenesis,Neuroplasticity is the brain’s capacity to change with experience. Neurogenesis is the production of new neurons in the brain (while many PNS nerves can regenerate).,54
31,2,Brain and Behavior,2.2,Brain Research,2.2.1,Identify three methods that scientists use to understand the structures of the brain,Brain structure can be studied via dissection and noninvasive imaging (CT; MRI).,60
32,2,Brain and Behavior,2.2,Brain Research,2.2.2,Identify four methods that scientists use to understand the function of brain structures,"Brain function can be studied through surgical methods (electrical stimulation, ablation, deep lesioning) and noninvasive techniques (EEG, PET, fMRI).",60
33,2,Brain and Behavior,2.3,The Cerebral Cortex,2.3.1,Explain how the left and right hemispheres of the cerebral cortex differ as a result of lateralization,"Split-brain research shows specialization: the left hemisphere is analytic, sequential, and language-focused (writing, calculating, timing, complex movements); the right processes information holistically and nonverbally (spatial/perceptual skills, visualization, pattern/face/melody recognition). People are not literally “left-brained” or “right-brained.”",64
34,2,Brain and Behavior,2.3,The Cerebral Cortex,2.3.2,Name the four lobes of the cerebral cortex and describe their function,Frontal: primary motor area (incl. mirror neurons) and association areas; prefrontal supports abstract thought and self. Parietal: primary sensory area for bodily sensations. Temporal: primary auditory area; hearing and language. Occipital: primary visual area; first cortical input from eyes.,64
35,2,Brain and Behavior,2.4,The Subcortex and Endocrine System,2.4.1,"Name the three major regions of the subcortex, and the parts that make up each one","Hindbrain: medulla (vital reflexes), reticular formation (activating system), cerebellum (coordination, posture, tone), pons (links medulla to other areas). Midbrain connects hindbrain and forebrain; with pons and medulla forms the brainstem. Forebrain: thalamus (sensory relay), hypothalamus (basic motives/physiology), limbic system (emotion, reward/punishment) incl. hippocampus (memory).",71
36,2,Brain and Behavior,2.4,The Subcortex and Endocrine System,2.4.2,"Explain how the endocrine system works, and describe the action of four endocrine glands","Endocrine glands release hormones into blood, influencing behavior, mood, and personality; many are regulated by the pituitary, which is influenced by the hypothalamus. Examples: pituitary (growth hormone; oxytocin; “master” control), pineal (melatonin; body clock), thyroid (metabolism), adrenal (epinephrine/norepinephrine; stress response; sexual development).",71
37,2,Brain and Behavior,2.5,Psychology and Your Skill Set: Self-Regulation,2.5.1,"Define self-regulation, and explain how it can help you in your personal and professional life","Self-regulation—governed by frontal-lobe executive functions—is the ability to control thoughts, emotions, and behavior to pursue goals; in childhood it predicts health, antisocial/criminal behavior, and financial security.",76
38,2,Brain and Behavior,2.5,Psychology and Your Skill Set: Self-Regulation,2.5.2,Create a plan to improve your self-regulation skills in an area that is important to you,"Improve self-regulation by adjusting attention (what you focus on), cognitions (how you interpret situations), and environments (structuring contexts to reduce temptations); apply these to maintain focus and resist impulses to reach goals.",76
39,3,Human Development,3.1,The Forces That Shape Development: Nature and Nurture,3.1.1,Explain how genes impact human development,"Genes reside on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in the nucleus of each cell. The DNA is twisted into chromosomes, and the DNA in each of the body’s cells is identical. The genes in each cell carry hereditary instructions. Most characteristics are polygenic and reflect the combined effects of dominant and recessive genes.",84
40,3,Human Development,3.1,The Forces That Shape Development: Nature and Nurture,3.1.2,Explain how the environment impacts human development,"Prenatal development is influenced by intrauterine environmental factors, such as various teratogens, including diseases, drugs, and radiation, as well as the mother’s diet, health, and emotions. After birth, a variety of environmental factors (access to good food and health care, schooling, family members, peer groups, media, and so on) contribute to the child’s development; environments that are deprived will hamper development while enriched environments will optimize it.",84
41,3,Human Development,3.1,The Forces That Shape Development: Nature and Nurture,3.1.3,Explain how epigenetic factors impact human development,"Though the genetic instructions in every cell are the same, those instructions can be “read” differently depending on epigenetic markers that are the product of environmental influences. For this reason, developmental psychologists say that heredity (nature) and environment (nurture) are interacting forces that are both necessary for human development.",84
42,3,Human Development,3.2,Physical and Perceptual Development,3.2.1,Describe key aspects of physical development across the lifespan,"Physical development tends to look similar across people, as evidenced by common infant reflexes and physical development that proceeds in a cephalocaudal and proximodistal manner. Physical changes that characterize puberty (e.g., development of sex characteristics) and adulthood (e.g., muscle and bone weakness) are also relatively similar across individuals. Though such similarities suggest an important role for “nature” or genetic factors, environmental factors (e.g., opportunities to practice motor skills in infancy; maintaining a healthy lifestyle in adulthood) also contribute to physical development.",89
43,3,Human Development,3.2,Physical and Perceptual Development,3.2.2,Explain key aspects of perceptual development across the lifespan,"While most of our senses (hearing, taste, touch, smell) are well developed at birth, infants’ vision is not as good as that of older children and adults. However, environmental stimulation and maturation of the visual system lead to rapid improvements, such that babies will see as well as adults by the age of one year. Depending on environmental factors (e.g., reading in poor light; listening to loud music), declines in perception (hearing loss; poor vision) may be seen as early as adolescence, and continue in adulthood.",89
44,3,Human Development,3.3,Emotional and Social Development,3.3.1,Describe key aspects of emotional development across the lifespan,"Basic emotions emerge very early in childhood and include happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, and disgust. In contrast, some complex emotions such as embarrassment, shame, guilt, and pride require a sense of the self as separate from others and thus do not develop until later (approximately 18 months). Emotions are often more intense in adolescence than they were in childhood. Though positive emotions are common, survey data suggest that recent generations of adolescents appear to be managing higher levels of sadness (depression) and fear (anxiety) than has been the case in the past. In terms of adulthood, there is little truth to the common adage that all adults experience an emotional midlife crisis. Instead, adulthood—and particularly older adulthood—is often characterized by high levels of positive emotion that may be related to the positivity effect (the tendency to pay attention to, and remember, more positive than negative information). Aging is also associated with an improved ability to regulate emotions. Some negative emotions, including anger and despair, appear to characterize the response to imminent death, though such responses are by no means universal.",92
45,3,Human Development,3.3,Emotional and Social Development,3.3.2-a,"Describe key aspects of social development across the lifespan, including Erikson’s eight psychosocial dilemmas","Erik Erikson identified a series of specific psychosocial dilemmas that occur as we age. Successful resolution of the dilemmas produces healthy development, whereas unsuccessful outcomes make it harder to deal with later crises. In order, the dilemmas are: trust vs. mistrust, autonomy vs. shame/doubt, initiative vs. doubt, industry vs. inferiority, identity vs. role confusion, intimacy vs. isolation, generativity vs. stagnation, and integrity vs. despair.",92
46,3,Human Development,3.3,Emotional and Social Development,3.3.2-b,"Describe key aspects of social development across the lifespan, including the importance of temperament and attachment in childhood","While it is clear that parents have an important role in shaping the quality of relationships, infants also make a contribution. In particular, infants’ temperament (which can be classed as easy, difficult, or slow-to-warm-up) influences caregivers’ responses to them. Research suggests that infants’ attachment to their caregivers is associated with their feelings of security and confidence that the caregiver will help them in times of stress. The quality of attachment can be classified as secure, insecure-avoidant, or insecure-ambivalent. Good-quality relationships are promoted when caregivers are sensitive to their babies’ signals. Whereas mothers typically emphasize caregiving, fathers tend to function as playmates for infants.",92
47,3,Human Development,3.3,Emotional and Social Development,3.3.2-c,"Describe key aspects of social development across the lifespan, including parenting styles and how they differ across cultures","Studies suggest that parental styles have a substantial impact on emotional and intellectual development. Three major parental styles are authoritarian, permissive, and authoritative (effective). Authoritative parenting, relying more on management techniques rather than power assertion or withdrawal of love, appears to benefit children the most, though this conclusion is most likely to hold true in Western countries. Other parenting styles may be more advantageous in other cultures.",92
48,3,Human Development,3.3,Emotional and Social Development,3.3.2-d,"Describe key aspects of social development across the lifespan, including the characteristics of emerging adults’ and older adults’ social networks","Relationships outside the family become increasingly important during adolescence, and parents often support their children’s identity explorations into their twenties. This extended adolescence is referred to as emerging adulthood, and it is most characteristic of wealthy nations. Social networks expand in middle adulthood but diminish in size in older adulthood. This reduction in size appears to be, at least to some extent, a function of older adults actively choosing to prune their networks and socialize only with people whose company they enjoy.",92
49,3,Human Development,3.4,"Language, Cognitive, and Moral Development",3.4.1,Describe key aspects of language development across the lifespan,"Language development proceeds from crying to cooing, then babbling, to the use of single words, and then to telegraphic speech. The underlying patterns of telegraphic speech suggest a biological predisposition to acquire language. However, learning augments this innate tendency. In particular, both prelanguage communication between parent and child (which involves shared rhythms, nonverbal signals, and turn-taking) and motherese/parentese (a simplified, musical style of speaking that parents use with very young children) help with language learning.",101
50,3,Human Development,3.4,"Language, Cognitive, and Moral Development",3.4.2-a,"Describe key aspects of cognitive development across the lifespan, including the central ideas that underlie Piaget’s theory of development","Piaget believed that children go through a fixed series of cognitive stages. The stages and their approximate age ranges are sensorimotor (0–2 years), preoperational (2–7 years), concrete operational (7–11 years), and formal operational (11 years–adult). Several concepts were important in his theory, including assimilation, accommodation, object permanence, egocentrism, and conservation. Assimilation refers to a situation in which children encounter something novel and can successfully integrate it with a concept (or schema) that they have already developed. Accommodation refers to a situation in which something novel does not fit into an existing schema and a new one must be established. Object permanence refers to children’s ability to understand that people and objects continue to exist even when they are no longer visible. Egocentrism refers to children’s inability to understand that the world looks different to other people. Egocentrism can relate to the physical world, when children fail to understand that people standing in other locations may not see what they can see from where they are situated. It may also relate to the mental world, when children do not understand that others have thoughts and feelings that differ from their own. When children begin to understand that others have their own unique thoughts and feelings we say that they have acquired a theory of mind. Conservation refers to the understanding that physical quantities stay the same even if they change their shape or appearance. At least three criticisms of Piaget’s work have emerged more recently. First, contrary to Piaget’s ideas, many psychologists now believe that cognitive development proceeds in a more gradual manner rather than in sharply defined stages. Second, more recent research suggests that children acquire cognitive milestones earlier than Piaget believed. Finally, researchers have suggested that Piaget may have underestimated the role of the environment (including culture) in guiding cognitive development.",101
51,3,Human Development,3.4,"Language, Cognitive, and Moral Development",3.4.2-b,"Describe key aspects of cognitive development across the lifespan, including the central ideas that underlie Vygotsky’s theory of cognitive development","Lev Vygotsky’s sociocultural theory places a particular emphasis on the role of culture and the environment in guiding cognitive development. In particular, he stressed that a child’s mental abilities are advanced by interactions with more-competent partners. Mental growth takes place in a child’s zone of proximal development, where a more skillful person may scaffold the child’s progress.",101
52,3,Human Development,3.4,"Language, Cognitive, and Moral Development",3.4.2-c,"Describe key aspects of cognitive development across the lifespan, including the focus of more recent work","More recent work in the area of cognitive development has focused on areas such as executive functions, mastery of academic subjects, memory, and intelligence.",101
53,3,Human Development,3.4,"Language, Cognitive, and Moral Development",3.4.3,"Describe key aspects of moral development across the lifespan, including Kohlberg’s three stages of moral development and Carol Gilligan’s criticism of this theory","Kohlberg’s theory included the following stages: Preconventional—moral thinking is guided by consequences (e.g., reward, punishment). Conventional—moral thinking is guided by a desire to please others or follow rules. Postconventional—moral thinking is guided by self-chosen ethical principles. Young children function at the preconventional level. Most people function at the conventional level of morality, but some never get beyond the preconventional level. Only a minority of people attain the highest, or postconventional, level of moral reasoning. Carol Gilligan distinguished between Kohlberg’s fairness (justice) perspective and a harm (caring) perspective. Because Kohlberg’s theory placed a high value on justice, she argued that women—who reason more frequently from a caring perspective—wrongly appeared to demonstrate less moral maturity than men. Now, most researchers believe that mature adult morality likely involves reasoning from both perspectives, and cultural research suggests that there may also be other moral foundations that underlie people’s values.",101
54,3,Human Development,3.5,Psychology and Your Skill Set: Ethical Behavior,3.5.1,Create a plan to manage a challenge to your own values,"Challenges to your ability to behave ethically can be managed by recognizing the potential for everyday ethical challenges, considering the conditions that will help or hinder ethical behavior in the face of those challenges, creating a plan for managing ethical challenges that are likely to occur, and working to counteract the tendency of others to behave in unethical ways. We hope that after reading this section, you’ll be better able to think about how you can use these strategies to help when you need to manage the everyday threats to your values!",110
55,4,"Sensation, Attention, and Perception",4.1,Sensation,4.1.1,"Define sensation and transduction, and outline what happens in the sensory organs during transduction","Sensation gathers information from the world via the sense organs and sends it to the brain. Transduction converts environmental energy into neural signals: eyes/ears/skin/tongue transduce light (electromagnetic), sound (mechanical), and other energies into electrical activity (action potentials) the brain can interpret.",118
56,4,"Sensation, Attention, and Perception",4.1,Sensation,4.1.2,Distinguish between absolute threshold and difference threshold,Absolute threshold: the minimum stimulus intensity detected 50% of the time. Difference threshold: the minimum difference between two stimuli detected 50% of the time.,118
57,4,"Sensation, Attention, and Perception",4.1,Sensation,4.1.3,Identify four ways by which the senses reduce the amount of information sent to the brain,"The senses limit input via: absence of specific transducers, restricted ranges of transducers, sensory adaptation, and feature detection—preventing overload of the brain.",118
58,4,"Sensation, Attention, and Perception",4.2,Vision,4.2.1,Describe three characteristics of light that are processed by the eye,"The eye encodes hue (wavelength/frequency), saturation (bandwidth of wavelengths), and brightness (amplitude).",121
59,4,"Sensation, Attention, and Perception",4.2,Vision,4.2.2,"Outline what is meant by accommodation in the eye, and the conditions that result from problems with accommodation","Accommodation is lens-based focusing. Common defects from focusing problems include myopia, hyperopia, presbyopia, and astigmatism.",121
60,4,"Sensation, Attention, and Perception",4.2,Vision,4.2.3,"Describe the process of transduction in the eye, and two problems associated with color vision","Retinal photoreceptors: rods support peripheral/night/black–white/motion; cones support color, acuity, daylight vision. Color vision issues include color blindness (cannot perceive color) and color weakness (cannot see certain colors).",121
61,4,"Sensation, Attention, and Perception",4.2,Vision,4.2.4,Contrast the trichromatic and opponent-process theories of color vision,"Trichromatic theory: three cone types (red, blue, green pigments) generate retinal signals. Opponent-process theory: post-retinal coding (e.g., at the optic nerve) uses opponent channels to explain color perception beyond the retina.",121
62,4,"Sensation, Attention, and Perception",4.3,Hearing,4.3.1,Describe two characteristics of sound that are processed by the ear,Pitch corresponds to frequency; loudness corresponds to amplitude of the sound wave.,127
63,4,"Sensation, Attention, and Perception",4.3,Hearing,4.3.2,"Describe the process of transduction in the ear, and two associated forms of hearing loss","Sound waves vibrate the eardrum, ossicles, and oval window, driving cochlear fluid; hair cells transduce movement into action potentials. Hearing loss: conductive (impaired transfer to inner ear) and sensorineural (hair cell/auditory nerve damage); noise-induced loss is a common sensorineural type.",127
64,4,"Sensation, Attention, and Perception",4.3,Hearing,4.3.3,Contrast the frequency and place theory of hearing pitch,"Frequency theory (pitch = firing rate) explains tones up to ~4,000 Hz; place theory (pitch = location of maximal cochlear excitation) explains higher tones above ~4,000 Hz.",127
65,4,"Sensation, Attention, and Perception",4.4,Chemical and Somesthetic Senses,4.4.1,Name the two chemical senses and three somesthetic senses,"Chemical: olfaction (smell), gustation (taste). Somesthetic: touch, vestibular (balance), kinesthetic (body position).",131
66,4,"Sensation, Attention, and Perception",4.4,Chemical and Somesthetic Senses,4.4.2,Describe the process of transduction in the nose,Olfactory receptors on nerve fibers bind airborne molecules; lock-and-key matching between receptor “holes” and molecule shapes triggers action potentials. Receptor location patterns aid odor identification.,131
67,4,"Sensation, Attention, and Perception",4.4,Chemical and Somesthetic Senses,4.4.3,Describe the process of transduction on the tongue,"Five basic tastes: sweet, salty, sour, bitter, umami. Sweet/bitter/umami use lock-and-key receptor matching; salty/sour involve direct ion flow into receptors—both routes trigger action potentials.",131
68,4,"Sensation, Attention, and Perception",4.4,Chemical and Somesthetic Senses,4.4.4,"Describe the process of transduction on the skin, including the function of large and small nerve fibers in the sensation of pain",Specialized skin receptors (and free endings) generate action potentials for touch and pain. Large fibers signal “warning pain” (acute harm); small fibers signal “reminding pain” (ongoing/old injury).,131

Sexual development begins with genetic sex (XX or XY chromosomes) and is then influenced by prenatal hormones, particularly androgens (male sex hormones) and estrogens (female sex hormones). One type of androgen, testosterone, is needed for a male embryo to develop male structures such as a penis and testicles. Sexual development in utero may be atypical when hormones are not present at the usual levels, or when the embryo is not sensitive to those hormones. For example, androgen insensitivity syndrome, exposure to progestin, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and similar problems may result in the development of an intersex individual. Postnatally, estrogens and androgens influence the development of different primary and secondary sexual characteristics in males and females.",350

203,11,"Sex, Gender, and Sexuality",11.2,Gender Identities and Roles,11.2.1,"Outline what is meant by gender identity, including the factors that influence it and what it means for an individual to be gender variant","Gender identity is the subjective sense of being male or female, irrespective of your biological sex. Many researchers believe that prenatal hormones exert a biological biasing effect that combines with social factors to influence gender identity. However, gender role socialization (that is, raising children to assume characteristics and roles that are seen as “appropriate” for their biological sex) seems to account for most observed female–male gender differences. Gender-variant individuals experience a persistent mismatch between their biological sex and their experienced gender.",354
204,11,"Sex, Gender, and Sexuality",11.2,Gender Identities and Roles,11.2.2,Explain what is meant by the term gender role,"The term gender role refers to a society’s favored pattern of behavior for each sex.

206,11,"Sex, Gender, and Sexuality",11.3,"Sexual Responses, Attitudes, and Behaviors",11.3.1,Contrast females and males in terms of their sexual response,"Sex is a powerful biological motive that finds expression in both men and women through various sexual behaviors, such as masturbation and intercourse. The similarities between female and male sexual responses and behaviors far outweigh the differences. For example, sexual arousal for both sexes is related to the body’s erogenous zones, but mental and emotional reactions are the ultimate source of sexual responsiveness. In addition, the sexual response of both men and women can be divided into four phases: excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution, though women move through the stages more slowly than men. Finally, men and women are similar in the average number of partners they have, and in their overall pattern of sexual activity. The frequency of sexual behavior gradually declines for both sexes with increasing age. However, many elderly persons remain sexually active, and large variations exist at all ages.",359
207,11,"Sex, Gender, and Sexuality",11.3,"Sexual Responses, Attitudes, and Behaviors",11.3.2,Explain how sexual attitudes and behaviors have changed over time,"Research suggests that people’s attitudes about sex, including premarital sex, have become more tolerant. There is less of a double standard around the sexual behaviors of men and women, and people now report having more sexual partners. Young people, in particular, are more likely now than in the past to engage in casual sex. People have greater access to pornography through online websites. More liberal attitudes and behaviors related to sex mean that people increasingly must deal with sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV. Other industrialized nations have followed the same pattern while the developing nations remain more conservative.",359

It is believed to emerge from infants’ temperament, which is the general pattern of attention, arousal, and mood that is evident from birth. Behavior is influenced by self-concept, which is a perception of one’s own personality traits. Self-esteem (our evaluation of ourselves) stems directly from our self-concept: A positive self-concept leads to high self-esteem. Low self-esteem results from a negative self-concept and is associated with stress, unhappiness, and depression.",382
217,12,Personality and Individual Differences,12.1,Theories of Personality,12.1.2,Describe how psychoanalytic theories explain personality,"Like other psychodynamic approaches, Sigmund Freud’s psychoanalytic theory emphasizes unconscious forces and conflicts within the personality. In Freud’s theory, personality is made up of the id, ego, and superego. The personality operates on three levels: the conscious, preconscious, and unconscious. The Freudian view of personality development is based on a series of psychosexual stages: the oral, anal, phallic, latency, and genital stages. According to Freud, fixation at any stage can leave a lasting imprint on personality. Neo-Freudian theorists accepted the broad features of Freudian psychology, but developed their own views.",382
218,12,Personality and Individual Differences,12.1,Theories of Personality,12.1.3,Describe how behaviorists and social learning theorists explain personality,"Behavioral theories of personality emphasize learning, conditioning, and immediate effects of the environment (situational determinants). Learning theorists Dollard and Miller consider habits the basic core of personality. Habits express the combined effects of drive, cue, response, and reward. Social learning theory adds cognitive elements, such as perception, thinking, and understanding to the behavioral view of personality. Social learning theory is exemplified by Julian Rotter’s concepts of the psychological situation, expectancies, and reinforcement value.",382
219,12,Personality and Individual Differences,12.1,Theories of Personality,12.1.4,Describe how humanistic theories explain personality,"Humanistic theories stress subjective experience, free will, self-actualization, and positive models of human nature. Abraham Maslow found that self-actualizers share characteristics that range from efficient perceptions of reality to frequent peak experiences. Carl Rogers viewed the self as an entity that emerges from personal experience. We tend to become aware of experiences that match our self-image and exclude those that are incongruent with it. The incongruent person has a highly unrealistic self-image, a mismatch between the self-image and the ideal self, or both. The congruent or fully functioning person is flexible and open to experiences and feelings. Like the ideal self, possible selves help us become the person we would like to become. As parents apply conditions of worth to children’s behavior, thoughts, and feelings, children begin to do the same. Internalized conditions of worth then contribute to incongruence that disrupts the organismic valuing process.",382
220,12,Personality and Individual Differences,12.2,Traits: The Building Blocks of Personality,12.2.1,Describe what is meant by a personality trait,"Traits are characteristics related to thoughts, feelings, and behavior that differ among people and are relatively stable over a variety of situations and a fairly long period of time. Though they are assumed to be quite stable, traits can sometimes interact with the environment (situations) to explain our behavior.",392
221,12,Personality and Individual Differences,12.2,Traits: The Building Blocks of Personality,12.2.2,"Outline the history of the trait approach to understanding personality, including the work of Allport and Cattell",Trait theories identify qualities that are most lasting or characteristic of a person. Allport made a useful distinction between central and secondary traits. Cattell’s theory defines the existence of 16 underlying source traits (or dimensions) that are central to personality. Source traits are measured by the Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire (16 PF).,392
222,12,Personality and Individual Differences,12.2,Traits: The Building Blocks of Personality,12.2.3,Contrast the Big Five and HEXACO models of personality,"The five-factor model (Big Five) attempted to reduce the number of personality dimensions outlined in Cattell’s research. Specifically, the Big Five model identifies five universal dimensions of personality: extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness to experience. Work in cultures outside of the West supported the existence of the Big Five but also identified a sixth dimension of personality—honesty/humility. The HEXACO model of personality thus extends the Big Five to include this sixth factor.",392
223,12,Personality and Individual Differences,12.2,Traits: The Building Blocks of Personality,12.2.4,"Explain what is meant by a personality type, and the weaknesses associated with this approach to classifying personality",Personality types group people into categories on the basis of shared traits. One significant weakness of this approach is that it oversimplifies people’s personalities because it classifies people as having/not having a particular trait instead of acknowledging that people may possess traits to a greater or lesser extent.,392
224,12,Personality and Individual Differences,12.3,Personality Assessment,12.3.1,Outline four ways in which personality can be measured,"Techniques typically used for personality assessment are interviews, observation, questionnaires, and projective tests. Structured and unstructured interviews provide much information, but they are subject to interviewer bias and misperceptions. The halo effect may also reduce the accuracy of an interview. Direct observation, sometimes involving situational tests, behavioral assessment, or the use of rating scales, allows evaluation of a person’s actual behavior. Personality questionnaires, such as the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2), are objective and reliable, but their validity is open to question. Projective tests ask a person to project thoughts or feelings onto an ambiguous stimulus or unstructured situation. Two well-known examples are the Rorschach Inkblot Test and the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT). Projective tests are low in validity and objectivity. Nevertheless, they are considered useful by many clinicians, particularly as part of a test battery.",399

231,13,Health Psychology,13.2,Stress and Health,13.2.1,Distinguish between two types of stressors: life events and hassles,"Stress is the mental and physical condition that occurs when we adjust or adapt to the environment. A stressor is a condition or event that challenges or threatens a person. Life events refer to stressors (both good and bad) that are larger scale, such as getting married or divorced, losing your job, or getting organized for a major holiday. Hassles (or microstressors) refer to stressors that are smaller in scope but ongoing, including a difficult commute to work or regularly having to deal with people making discriminatory remarks or inappropriate jokes at your expense. Research indicates that multiple life events tend to increase long-range susceptibility to health problems. However, one’s current health is more closely related to the intensity and severity of daily hassles.",419

Stress is intensified when a situation is appraised as a threat. During a secondary appraisal, we examine stressors in relation to our resources and select a way to manage stress. Appraisals are guided by beliefs about perceived control and competence to cope with the stressor, unpredictability of the stressor, and pressure.",419

Four factors that contribute to noncompliance include cognitive factors, memory, the relationship between care providers and recipients, and emotions (particularly anxiety and depression). Minimizing noncompliance requires that healthcare providers use good communication and interpersonal skills to build a trusting relationship with patients and clients. Doing so will increase the likelihood that they are able to ensure that patients understand the treatment, promote a willingness to abide by it, and will improve the ability to properly assess clients’ ability to follow through with it.",426
240,13,Health Psychology,13.4,Improving Health Through Coping,13.4.1,"Distinguish between problem-focused, emotion-focused, and relationship-focused coping","Problem-focused coping involves directly managing or remedying a stressful or threatening situation. Emotion-focused coping relies on managing or controlling one’s emotional reaction to a stressful or threatening situation. Defense mechanisms are a specific type of emotion-focused coping, and they are used to avoid, deny, or distort sources of threat or anxiety, including threats to one’s self-image. Relationship-focused coping is based on the idea that our relationships are important and that we are motivated to preserve them by engaging in strategies such as demonstrating empathy, compromising, and providing social support.",430

In particular, social dilemmas, such as the tragedy of the commons, arise when individuals are enticed into overuse of scarce, shared resources, leading to a reduction in the availability of that resource, or its degradation. In this way, individual consumption has an important influence on the group as a whole.",563
322,18,Applied Psychology,18.2,Environmental Psychology,18.2.4,Outline four solutions that have been put forward to minimize environmental damage,"First, it helps if conservation is seen as a group effort. Second, it may be useful to rearrange rewards and costs, such as levying taxes, offering incentives, and removing barriers to environmentally friendly behavior. Third, people can consider persuasive advertising campaigns and initiatives that are based on self-interest (cost savings), the collective good (protecting one’s own children and future generations), or intrinsic motivation to take better care of the planet. Fourth, feedback about people’s efforts should be included in any environmental initiative.",563
323,18,Applied Psychology,18.3,"Legal, Community, and Sports Psychology",18.3.1,"Explain the role of legal, community, and sports psychologists","Legal psychologists apply psychological science to the legal system and investigate the relationship between people and the law. Community psychologists focus on communities rather than individuals, particularly the health of groups such as organizations, neighborhoods, and societies. Sports psychologists seek to enhance sports performance and the benefits of sports participation.",570
324,18,Applied Psychology,18.3,"Legal, Community, and Sports Psychology",18.3.2,Outline four techniques that may be used in scientific jury selection,"In scientific jury selection, jurors’ demographic information (e.g., age, sex, race, occupation, education, political affiliation, religion) can be helpful in predicting their behavior during a court trial. A second technique is to carry out a community survey to find out how local citizens feel about the case. Third, psychologists watch for authoritarian personality traits in potential jurors. A fourth strategy is to observe potential jurors’ nonverbal behavior.",570
325,18,Applied Psychology,18.3,"Legal, Community, and Sports Psychology",18.3.3,Describe four factors that impair jurors’ ability to reach an impartial verdict,"Research from mock juries shows that jury decisions are far from impartial. Four challenges to reaching a fair verdict include the fact that jurors are rarely able to put aside their biases, attitudes, and values while making a decision, they are not very good at separating evidence from their perceptions of the people involved in the trial, they tend to inappropriately incorporate information from pretrial publicity into their deliberations, and they usually cannot suspend judgment until all the evidence is presented.",570
326,18,Applied Psychology,18.3,"Legal, Community, and Sports Psychology",18.3.4,Explain the central ideas that underlie community psychology,"Community psychologists emphasize the cultural, economic, environmental, and political forces that shape our health. A community psychology approach to health empowers people to bring about the changes that they want to see, rather than waiting for experts to step in and help. Community psychology emphasizes the need to be proactive in preventing health problems rather than trying to manage them after-the-fact.",570
327,18,Applied Psychology,18.3,"Legal, Community, and Sports Psychology",18.3.5,Explain what sports psychologists have learned about the development of motor skills and achieving peak performance,"A motor skill is a nonverbal response chain assembled into a smooth performance. Motor skills are guided by internal mental models called motor programs. Motor skills are refined by observing and imitating a skilled model, learning verbal rules to back up motor learning, practicing under lifelike conditions, getting feedback (from a mirror, videotape, coach, or observer), practicing natural units rather than breaking the task into artificial parts, and engaging in mental practice (imagining a skilled performance). Peak performance is more likely when athletes go through a fixed routine before each event, use imagery and relaxation techniques to optimize arousal, use cognitive-behavioral strategies to guide their efforts in a supportive, positive way, and use self-regulation strategies to evaluate performance and make adjustments to keep it at optimum levels.",570
328,18,Applied Psychology,18.4,Psychology and Your Skill Set: Career Preparation,18.4.1,Create a plan that will allow you to begin the process of preparing for a rewarding career,"Begin the process of researching careers early in your degree, making use of resources such as your campus career services office, career-related sites on the Internet, and informational interviewing. Determine the skills that are necessary for jobs that interest you and assess yourself on these skills. If you believe that you need to develop any of them further to make yourself competitive, consider what types of experiences would help you to do so. Begin to document your skills by building a portfolio or e-portfolio. Manage your digital footprint carefully. Remove any web-based material about you that you would not want a potential employer to find, and work to create digital content that is professional (e.g., LinkedIn profile, e-portfolio).",575
