## Answer Key

1. The model of motivation begins with a **need**, which is an internal deficiency. This need causes a **drive**, or a state of bodily tension, which in turn activates a **response** (an action or series of actions). The response is designed to push the individual toward a **goal**, which is the target of the motivated behavior that will satisfy the need and end the chain of events.
2. **Intrinsic motivation** occurs when we act based on internal rewards because we enjoy an activity or see it as an opportunity to learn and grow. In contrast, **extrinsic motivation** stems from external factors, such as pay, grades, rewards, or approval. For example, cooking for pleasure is intrinsically motivated, while cooking for a living is extrinsically motivated.
3. The **Yerkes-Dodson law** describes the relationship between arousal and performance as an inverted-U function. For simple, well-practiced tasks, high arousal does not harm performance. However, for moderately or very difficult tasks, performance is optimal at moderate arousal levels and declines if arousal becomes too high or too low. As task complexity increases, the optimal level of arousal for peak performance becomes lower.
4. **Anorexia nervosa** is an eating disorder characterized by a refusal to maintain a normal body weight (85% or less of normal), an intense fear of becoming fat, and a distorted body image. **Bulimia nervosa** is characterized by recurring episodes of binge eating (consuming an unusually large amount of food) followed by purging behaviors like vomiting or using laxatives to prevent weight gain.
5. The two types of thirst are extracellular and intracellular. **Extracellular thirst** occurs when water is lost from the fluids surrounding the body's cells, such as from sweating or bleeding. **Intracellular thirst** is triggered when excess salt in the diet causes fluid to be drawn out of the cells.
6. Schachter and Singer's two-factor theory states that emotion occurs when we experience **general physiological arousal** (the first factor) and then apply a **cognitive label** to that arousal based on our interpretation of the situation (the second factor). The specific label we choose through this process of attribution determines the emotion we experience.
7. The **opponent-process theory** states that a strong emotion is followed by the opposite emotional state when the stimulus ends. With repetition, the initial emotion weakens, while the opposing aftereffect strengthens. This explains why an activity like hang gliding, initially terrifying, can become a thrilling and reinforcing "rush" of euphoria after repeated experiences.
8. The **sympathetic branch** of the autonomic nervous system activates the body for emergency "fight or flight" actions, increasing heart rate, releasing blood sugar, and slowing digestion. The **parasympathetic branch** reverses this arousal, calming the body by slowing the heart, lowering blood pressure, and conserving energy.
9. The three components of explanatory style are **pervasiveness**, **permanence**, and **personal** factors. When facing a negative event, optimists view it as limited in its effect (not pervasive), short-term (not permanent), and due to changeable circumstances (not personal). Pessimists view negative events as impacting all aspects of life, long-lasting, and resulting from unchangeable personal traits.
10. The three major categories of motives are biological, stimulus, and learned. **Biological motives** are innate needs essential for survival, such as hunger and thirst. **Stimulus motives** are also innate but not strictly necessary for survival, expressing our needs for stimulation and information, like curiosity and exploration. **Learned motives** are based on learned needs, drives, and goals, often social in nature, such as the needs for achievement, power, or approval.

## Essay Questions

1. Discuss the complex interplay of internal and external factors that regulate hunger. In your answer, analyze the role of the hypothalamus, the concept of a set point, external eating cues, taste, and cultural influences.
2. Provide a comprehensive analysis of the four basic aspects of an emotion as outlined in the text: experience, physiology, expression, and cognition. For each aspect, explain its key features and provide detailed examples from the source material.
3. Compare and contrast the three primary theories of emotion discussed in the chapter: the James-Lange theory, the Cannon-Bard theory, and Schachter and Singer’s two-factor theory. Explain how these theories conceptualize the relationship between physiological arousal, behavior, and emotional experience, highlighting the evolution of thought to include cognitive processes.
4. Explain the concept of emotion regulation. Describe the five strategies for managing emotion-related expressions mentioned in the text (situation selection, situation modification, redirecting attention, cognitive reappraisal, and response modulation) and provide a real-world example for each.
5. Drawing upon the principles of positive psychology, explain how a person's explanatory style contributes to their subjective well-being. Define optimism and describe how an optimistic versus pessimistic interpretation of life events differs across the dimensions of pervasiveness, permanence, and personal factors.
