# Day 1  
## Why We Do Anything  
*(Ch. 2 → 6 → 10)*

**Today’s goals**
- Define motivation as need → drive → response → goal
- Distinguish intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation
- Apply Ch. 2 methods in a live micro-experiment
- Explain when rewards help vs backfire

<!--
Time: 2 min
Instructor aims: Set frame: Today = methods + learning → motivation.
Accessibility: Read goals aloud; invite a student to paraphrase "in your words."
-->

---

## Agenda (Day 1)
1. Hook: Why are you here today?
2. Need vs Incentive
3. Model of Motivation
4. Intrinsic vs Extrinsic (+ overjustification)
5. Methods mini: IV, DV, confounds, ethics
6. In-room demo (reward vs no reward)
7. Debrief + Bridge to Day 2
8. Exit ticket

<!--
Time: 1 min
Script: “We’ll move fast, talk to your neighbor, and write short clear answers.”
-->

---

## Hook — Two reasons you came
Write two reasons you came to class today.  
Label each **Need** or **Incentive**.

<!--
Time: 3 min (1 individual, 2 pair)
Instructor move: Cold-call 2 volunteers; if slow, offer examples: “learn the material” (need: competence) vs “attendance points” (incentive).
No-tech: Index cards work.
ELL/UDL: Sentence starter on board: “I came because ___ which is a [Need/Incentive].”
-->

---

## Need vs Incentive (Clean definitions)

- **Need**: internal state or deficiency pushing behavior (e.g., hunger, belonging, competence)
- **Incentive**: external goal or cue pulling behavior (e.g., paycheck, praise, bonus points)

**Check**: Is “deadline pressure” a need or an incentive?

<!--
Time: 3 min
Answer: Incentive (external cue/constraint) though it can create felt need; invite nuance briefly.
-->

---

## Model of Motivation (Core sequence)

**Need → Drive → Response → Goal → Need reduced (or learned persistence)**

Example:  
Lack of sleep (need) → drowsiness (drive) → nap/coffee (response) → alertness (goal) → reduced need.

<!--
Time: 3–4 min
Script: “Name each box out loud; now swap in a different example: study motivation.”
Board: Draw the chain; ask class to plug in examples.
-->

---

## Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Motivation

- **Intrinsic**: engagement for interest/joy/meaning.
- **Extrinsic**: engagement for separable outcomes (money, grades).

**Overjustification**: heavy external rewards can reduce intrinsic interest in an already-fun activity.

<!--
Time: 4 min
Prompt: “Name a hobby that got less fun after it became a chore.”
Equity: Validate students with work/life obligations; clarify “not anti-reward” but “fit matters.”
-->

---

## Methods Mini (Ch. 2 applied)

- **IV**: what we manipulate (reward vs no reward)
- **DV**: what we measure (enjoyment rating; voluntary retry time)
- **Confounds**: differences besides IV (row location, timing, instructions)
- **Ethics**: consent, equal access, debrief

<!--
Time: 5 min
Script: “We’ll now run a tiny, fair test. You can opt out.”
No-tech: Use paper Likert scales 1–7 if no devices.
-->

---

## Demo Instructions (Read verbatim)

- You will complete a 60-second **fun puzzle**.
- **Left side** of room: you’ll receive a small token reward after the task.  
- **Right side**: no reward.  
- Afterward, you’ll rate enjoyment **1–7** and can choose to retry for up to 60 seconds.

**DV options:**  
A) Enjoyment rating (1–7)  
B) Voluntary retry time (seconds)

<!--
Time: 2 min
Classroom management: Mark groups clearly (slide + point). Optional randomizer: rows/odd-even.
Equity: If tokens may be sensitive, use “raffle ticket” or “sticker—kudos note.”
-->

---

## Run the Demo (60 seconds x 2)

- Start puzzle: 60 sec  
- Collect rating (1–7)  
- Offer voluntary retry: “You may stop anytime in the next 60 sec.”

<!--
Time: 4–5 min
Contingency: If participation is low, do volunteer subset (n≈10) while others observe.
Tip: Display a visible countdown timer.
-->

---

## Data Capture (fill together)

| Group       | Mean Enjoyment (1–7) | Mean Retry Time (sec) |
|------------:|:---------------------:|:---------------------:|
| Reward      |                       |                       |
| No Reward   |                       |                       |

**Quick compute**: Which group shows higher **intrinsic** interest?

<!--
Time: 4 min
Math tip: Sample a few datapoints if time is tight; or collect by show-of-hands for bins 1–3 / 4–5 / 6–7.
-->

---

## Debrief: When Rewards Help vs Harm

- If task is already fun → heavy rewards may reduce intrinsic interest.  
- If task is dull/new/effortful → well-designed rewards can bootstrap motivation.  
- Learning ties: reinforcement schedules, cues, habit formation.

**Think-Pair**: Give one case where a reward would help you start a habit this week.

<!--
Time: 6–7 min
Instructor steer: Name at least one valid confound the class noticed (e.g., seating, instructions).
-->

---

## Bridge to Day 2

Tomorrow: **Memory & Cognition → Emotion → Motivation.**  
We’ll practice **reappraisal** and compare **emotion theories**.

**Homework (5–8 min)**  
Complete the 7-Day Behavior Plan (handout) draft. Bring it.

<!--
Time: 1 min
Collect questions; remind “short + specific” is okay.
-->

---

## Exit Ticket (Day 1)

1) Identify the **IV** and **DV** in today’s demo.  
2) Predict interest at next class if rewards stop.  
3) Name one **confound** and a fix.

<!--
Time: 4–5 min
Grading: 3 points completion/clarity.
-->

---

# Day 2  
## Feeling Helps Thinking  
*(Ch. 7/8 → 10)*

**Today’s goals**
- Explain how memory tags and appraisal shape emotion
- Compare James–Lange, Cannon–Bard, Two-Factor
- Practice reappraisal; predict motivational impact

<!--
Time: 2 min
-->

---

## Agenda (Day 2)
1. Warm-up: hot thought → first appraisal
2. Emotional memory: arousal tags, schema, retrieval bias
3. Appraisal flow (situation → appraisal → emotion → action)
4. Theory jigsaw (JL vs CB vs Two-Factor)
5. Reappraisal lab (before/after)
6. Bridge to motivation (expectancy × value; persistence)
7. Exit ticket

<!--
Time: 1 min
-->

---

## Warm-up: Name the Hot Thought

Recall a recent anxious moment.  
Write the **first thought** you noticed.

**Share with a partner** (only if comfortable): what changed after that thought?

<!--
Time: 4 min
Safety: “Share only what you’re okay sharing.” Offer a neutral example if needed.
-->

---

## Emotional Memory (Ch. 7 essentials)

- **Arousal tags**: heightened arousal → stronger memory consolidation  
- **Schema**: prior knowledge fills gaps (can distort)  
- **Retrieval bias**: vivid memories feel more true/influential than they are

**Application**: A single bad test can steer future study motivation.

<!--
Time: 6–7 min
ELL support: Define each term with 5–7 word plain-language paraphrase.
-->

---

## Appraisal Flow (Ch. 8)

**Situation → Appraisal (meaning) → Emotion → Action urge**

- Appraisals include: controllability, expectancy, value, blame.
- Change appraisal → often changes emotion.

**Mini-practice**: Label the appraisal in “I’m doomed” vs “I can improve.”

<!--
Time: 6 min
-->

---

## Theories of Emotion (Compare & contrast)

| Theory         | Core Idea                         | Unique Prediction                     |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| James–Lange    | Body change → emotion follows     | If body blocked, emotion weakens      |
| Cannon–Bard    | Body & feeling simultaneous       | Body not required for feeling         |
| Two-Factor     | Arousal + cognitive label → emotion | Relabeling can flip emotion (same arousal) |

**Class example**: Racing heart before presentation → fear vs excitement.

<!--
Time: 7–8 min
Prompt: “Which prediction could we test in class?”
-->

---

## Jigsaw Activity (10 minutes total)

- Groups A/B/C take one theory.  
- Produce: 2-line summary, 1 classroom example, 1 prediction.  
- **2-minute share-outs** per group.

**Evaluator job**: Peers must name one strength & one limitation.

<!--
Time: 10–12 min (8 prep + 4 share)
No-tech: Use whiteboards or notebook paper.
-->

---

## Reappraisal Lab (Before/After)

Rewrite your hot thought using a controllable, specific frame:  
“Instead of ______, I’ll tell myself ______.”

**Rate emotion** before (1–7) and after (1–7).

**Partner check**: Does the new appraisal change predicted action?

<!--
Time: 10–12 min
Script: “Keep it realistic; avoid toxic positivity. Aim for truer, more useful.”
Instructor move: Circulate; ask “What changed in your appraisal?”
-->

---

## Bridge Back to Motivation

- Expectancy × Value: believing you can + caring about outcome → effort  
- Tagged memories (wins/losses) shift expectancy  
- Reappraised situations can restore approach motivation

**Write**: One tweak to your 7-Day Plan that improves expectancy or value.

<!--
Time: 5–6 min
-->

---

## Applied Example (Test Anxiety)

Old label: “Heart racing → I’m failing.”  
New label: “Heart racing → body fueling focus.”

**Predicted changes**: Emotion intensity? Strategy? Persistence?

<!--
Time: 3 min
-->

---

## Exit Ticket (Day 2)

1) Which appraisal did you change?  
2) Which theory best explains your shift?  
3) Predicted effect on your motivation tomorrow?

<!--
Time: 4 min
Grading: 3 points completion/clarity.
-->

---

## Friday Preview (Review & Integration)

Bring:
- Completed 7-Day Behavior Plan
- One question on methods/learning/memory/cognition/motivation

**We’ll** do mini-cases, clickers, and teach-backs.

<!--
Time: 1 min
-->

---

## Appendix A — Clicker Bank (Use Fri or as checks)

1) Overjustification predicts what change to intrinsic interest after rewards stop?  
2) Pick the DV: “Half got a token; we timed voluntary extra attempts.”  
3) Which schedule sustains weekly motivation best: fixed-ratio, variable-ratio, fixed-interval? Why?  
4) A vivid but inaccurate recollection that drives avoidance—name the memory process and likely bias.  
5) “I’m scared” → “I’m excited” with same arousal—what theory predicts the shift?  
6) Label the appraisal that changed in a successful reappraisal.  
7) Map examples to **Need** vs **Incentive**.  
8) Identify a confound in a classroom demo scenario.  
9) Given data, decide if reward helped or harmed intrinsic interest.  
10) Which is **biological** vs **stimulus** vs **learned** motive?

<!--
Tip: Keep answer keys in presenter notes or a separate card.
-->

---

## Appendix B — No-Tech / Low-Tech Fallbacks

- Use paper Likert scales & tally by show-of-hands bins.  
- Whiteboard data table instead of spreadsheet.  
- If tokens are sensitive, use praise notes or raffle entries.

**Timing trims (if you have 35 min)**  
- Skip jigsaw; do instructor-led theory compare + 2 clickers.  
- Shorten demo to enjoyment rating only (no retry time).

---

## Appendix C — ELL/UDL Supports

- Post key terms with plain-language glosses.  
- Provide sentence starters and checklists.  
- Honor opt-outs; alternate examples if personal sharing is hard.  
- Read instructions and display them simultaneously.

---

## Appendix D — Instructor Script Snippets

- “Name our IV and DV right now.”  
- “What’s one confound we should fix next time?”  
- “Replace ‘I’m doomed’ with one realistic reframe.”  
- “Which theory would predict your change?”
```
