- [ ] 45–49 Bridge + assign 7-Day Plan draft
- [ ] 49–50 Exit ticket (collect)

## Day 2 (50 minutes)
- [ ] 0–4 Warm-up: hot thought → appraisal
- [ ] 4–11 Emotional memory (tags, schema, retrieval bias)
- [ ] 11–17 Appraisal flow; label examples
- [ ] 17–28 Jigsaw (theories) + share
- [ ] 28–40 Reappraisal lab (before/after)
- [ ] 40–46 Bridge to motivation (expectancy × value)

## Contingencies
- Low time: Skip retry-time DV; keep enjoyment only.
- Low participation: Run volunteer subset; narrate methods anyway.
- Accessibility: Offer opt-out task; accept alternative examples.

## Grading (lightweight)
- Day 1 exit (3 pts), Day 2 exit (3 pts) — completion/clarity
- 7-Day Plan draft due Friday (4 pts): DV clear, reinforcement realistic, one reappraisal present
