The PNS includes the somatic system (sensory input to brain; motor commands to body) and the autonomic system (sympathetic and parasympathetic branches).                                                                                                                                                                           | 54            | 82        | 2    | 1          |

Between neurons, communication is chemical: neurotransmitters cross the synapse to receptors, exciting or inhibiting the next cell; neuropeptides modulate synaptic activity.                                                                                                                                                       | 54            | 82        | 2    | 1          |

Neurogenesis is the production of new neurons in the brain (while many PNS nerves can regenerate).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 54            | 82        | 2    | 1          |

People are not literally “left-brained” or “right-brained.”                                                                                   | 64            | 92        | 2    | 1          |

Parietal: primary sensory area for bodily sensations. Temporal: primary auditory area; hearing and language. Occipital: primary visual area; first cortical input from eyes.                                                                                                                                                   | 64            | 92        | 2    | 1          |

Midbrain connects hindbrain and forebrain; with pons and medulla forms the brainstem. Forebrain: thalamus (sensory relay), hypothalamus (basic motives/physiology), limbic system (emotion, reward/punishment) incl. hippocampus (memory).                                                 | 71            | 99        | 2    | 1          |

Examples: pituitary (growth hormone; oxytocin; “master” control), pineal (melatonin; body clock), thyroid (metabolism), adrenal (epinephrine/norepinephrine; stress response; sexual development).                                                                             | 71            | 99        | 2    | 1          |

Ekman proposed six basic emotions (surprise, happiness, sadness, anger, disgust, fear) that are fast, early-developing, universal, and shared with other mammals. Newer BETs note limits of facial cues alone, emphasize multiple channels, suggest ~25 emotion-like states, and highlight cultural differences alongside similarities. | 338           | 366       | 2    | 5          |
