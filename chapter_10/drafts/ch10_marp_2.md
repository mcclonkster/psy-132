# Emotion  
_PS Y 132 — One-Class Overview_

Today we will:  
- Clarify what counts as an emotion (and what doesn’t)  
- See how **arousal** and **appraisal** interact  
- Compare classic theories with one ongoing example  
- Understand regulation options (reappraisal vs suppression)  
- Notice culture and context (display rules, norms)  
- Apply it to everyday moments

<!--
Presenter notes:
- Frame the day: “Emotion isn’t just a feeling word; it’s a multi-part process that coordinates the body and action.”
- Invite one quick voice: “Name a recent moment you felt something strongly (no details needed)—what was happening?”
- Estimated: 2 min
-->

## What is an emotion?

A coordinated response system with **four parts**:
1. **Subjective experience** (what it feels like)  
2. **Physiological arousal** (autonomic and endocrine changes)  
3. **Expressive behavior** (face, voice, posture)  
4. **Cognitive appraisal** (meaning assigned to the situation)

<!--
Notes:
- Draw four small boxes on the board as you list them.
- Emphasize: an event can change only some parts (e.g., body revs with no clear label).
- Estimated: 3 min
-->

---

## Arousal ≠ emotion

**Arousal** is body readiness (sympathetic “go,” parasympathetic “restore”).  
**Emotion** is arousal plus the **appraisal** and the **action urge** that follows.

Example: racing heart before speaking could be tagged “fear” or “excitement,” leading to different actions.

<!--
Notes:
- Connect back to Chapter 2: ANS basics; arousal is fuel, not the steering.
- Ask: “Can the same heartbeat feel different in different contexts?” Invite one answer.
- Estimated: 3 min
-->

---

## A quick map (we’ll use it all class)

**Situation → Arousal + Appraisal → Label → Action urge**

- Situation: what’s happening (and what you think is happening)  
- Arousal: body changes (heart rate, breathing, skin conductance)  
- Appraisal: meaning (controllability, expectancy, value, norms)  
- Label: fear, anger, joy, pride, etc.  
- Action urge: avoid, approach, confront, seek help

<!--
Notes:
- Keep this diagram simple; we’ll return to it for every example.
- Estimated: 2 min
-->

---

## Ongoing example we’ll revisit

Public speaking invite, tomorrow.  
- Same bodily signs: rapid heart rate, warm hands, alertness.  
- Two possible appraisals: “threat” vs “challenge.”  
- Two likely labels: anxiety vs excitement.  
- Two action urges: avoid vs approach.

<!--
Notes:
- Promise we’ll run this example through every theory and regulation strategy.
- Estimated: 2 min
-->

---

## Classic theories, one example

We’ll apply public speaking to three classic views.

- **James–Lange:** body changes → feeling follows  
- **Cannon–Bard:** body and feeling occur in parallel  
- **Two-Factor (Schachter–Singer):** general arousal needs a label from context

<!--
Notes:
- Avoid long history; focus on “what each predicts for the same episode.”
- Estimated: 2 min
-->

---

## James–Lange (body first)

“My heart is pounding, my hands shake; I notice that, and I feel afraid.”

Prediction: if you block or misread feedback from the body, the feeling weakens or changes.

<!--
Notes:
- Tie back to interoception: noticing internal signals varies by person.
- Quick probe: “What would JL predict if you interpret your shaking as ‘readiness’ instead of ‘danger’?”
- Estimated: 2 min
-->

---

## Cannon–Bard (parallel)

“The brain triggers body changes and feeling at the same time.”

Prediction: an intact feeling is possible even if bodily feedback is altered; systems are coordinated centrally.

<!--
Notes:
- Emphasize simultaneity: not “first this, then that.”
- Estimated: 1–2 min
-->

---

## Two-Factor (arousal + label)

“I feel general arousal; the **context** and my **appraisal** decide whether it’s fear or excitement.”

Prediction: change the label or the interpreted cause, and the emotion can flip even if arousal stays the same.

<!--
Notes:
- This will feed directly into reappraisal later.
- Estimated: 2 min
-->

---

## How we measure emotion (signals we can see)

- **Self-report:** feeling labels, intensity scales  
- **Physiology:** heart rate, skin conductance, respiration, pupil size  
- **Expression:** facial action, voice tone, posture  
- **Behavior:** choices, approach/avoidance, reaction time

No single channel is perfect; convergence matters.

<!--
Notes:
- Caution: “lie detectors” (polygraphs) are arousal detectors, not truth detectors.
- Estimated: 2 min
-->

---

## Expression and display rules

- Many expressions are widely recognizable (smiles, frowns), but  
- **Display rules** vary by culture, context, and role (who is present, status, setting)  
- People can modulate signs without changing inner state

Implication: reading faces is informative, not definitive.

<!--
Notes:
- Keltner
- Example: different expectations for showing anger at work vs home; pride displays vary by context.
- Estimated: 2 min
-->

---

## Appraisal in plain language

We tend to ask (fast or slow):  
- Can I control this?  
- Is success likely?  
- Does this matter to me?  
- Is this appropriate here?

Small changes in appraisal can shift both label and action.

<!--
Notes:
- Plug this into the speaking example: “I can prepare and do okay” vs “I will bomb.”
- Estimated: 2 min
-->

---

## Why the same arousal feels different

Same heartbeat; two appraisals:

- **Threat:** low control, low expectancy → label “anxiety” → urge to avoid  
- **Challenge:** some control, moderate expectancy → label “excitement” → urge to approach

<!--
Notes:
- Ask for one additional domain: sports, exams, interviews.
- Estimated: 2 min
-->

---

## Regulation: where to intervene

Options along the process:

- Situation selection or modification (choose or change the context)  
- Attentional deployment (what you focus on)  
- **Cognitive change (reappraisal)**  
- Response modulation (**suppression**, breathing pace, posture)

No single strategy is “best”; context decides.

<!--
Notes:
- Keep the model practical. We’ll compare reappraisal and suppression next.
- Estimated: 2 min
-->

---

## Reappraisal vs suppression

**Reappraisal:** change the meaning you assign (“I’m geared up” rather than “I’m doomed”).  
- Often reduces distress with lower physiological and social cost.  
- Requires time and some cognitive bandwidth.

**Suppression:** hide or dampen expression.  
- Useful briefly when stakes demand composure.  
- Tends to leave arousal high; can impair memory and social connection if overused.

<!--
Notes:
- Pragmatic rule: reappraise when you have time; suppress briefly when you must, then debrief later.
- Estimated: 3 min
-->

---

## Reappraisal in the speaking example

- Old label: “danger → I’ll freeze.”  
- Reframe: “arousal = energy; imperfect delivery is acceptable; my goal is clarity, not perfection.”  
- Likely shift: anxiety → focused readiness; avoid → approach

<!--
Notes:
- Invite one short reframe from the room. Keep it realistic and specific, not sugary.
- Estimated: 2 min
-->

---

## Not a cure-all

- Reappraisal won’t fix lack of sleep, hostile contexts, or zero preparation.  
- Suppression is not “bad” in short, high-stakes moments.  
- Mixed strategies are normal: small environment changes + modest reframe.

<!--
Notes:
- Anchor this in real life; avoid “silver bullet” messaging.
- Estimated: 2 min
-->

---

## Culture and context again

- Norms about “appropriate” feeling and expression shape appraisal and labels.  
- Example: pride and modesty norms; grief displays; anger at authority.

Takeaway: your label is partly learned; other people’s labels differ for reasons, not defects.

<!--
Notes:
- Keep this brief to avoid drifting into a culture lecture. Tie back to appraisal and display rules.
- Estimated: 2 min
-->

---

## Brief debate snapshot (what to keep in mind)

- **Basic emotions** view: some universal patterns in expression and physiology.  
- **Constructionist/appraisal** view: categories are built from arousal + concepts + context.

In practice: labels and norms matter, and some patterns repeat across people.

<!--
Notes:
- Do not litigate the full debate; show why both ideas are useful: recognizability and flexibility.
- Estimated: 2 min
-->

---

## Common misconceptions

- “Emotion is just feeling.” → It’s a coordinated system.  
- “Calming down means shutting feelings off.” → Often means better labeling or shifting attention.  
- “Reappraisal is pretending.” → It’s choosing a true, more useful frame.  
- “Suppression is always bad.” → It’s situational; use briefly, then adjust.

<!--
Notes:
- Keep tone respectful; many students have picked up folk theories.
- Estimated: 2 min
-->

---

## Quick oral checks (no writing)

- “Two students: same arousal, different labels—give me the contexts that change it.”  
- “One volunteer: name a time you used reappraisal or suppression. Which worked and why?”  
- “Lightning round: threat vs challenge—call it out as I describe scenarios.”

<!--
Notes:
- Keep this tight. Aim for 3–4 quick voices without pressure.
- Estimated: 3 min
-->

---

## Why this matters for you

- Helps you predict action urges and plan ahead  
- Gives options for how to work with nerves, anger, disappointment  
- Improves communication: you can describe what changed—arousal, label, or context

<!--
Notes:
- Invite one student to say where this would help this week (interview, exam, conversation).
- Estimated: 1–2 min
-->

---

## One-slide takeaway

> **Emotion = Arousal + Appraisal + Expression + Experience**  
> Same arousal, different appraisal → different label and action.

Practical tools: small context changes, attention shifts, truthful reappraisals, brief suppression when necessary.

<!--
Notes:
- Bridge back to motivation: “Yesterday we asked why we act; today, we saw how it feels and how meaning steers action.”
- Estimated: 1 min
