VS
Operant Conditioning
Classical Conditioning
Voluntary behaviour - Actively chosen based on consequences.
Involuntary behaviour - Response is automatic or reflexive.
Consequence comes after behaviour.
Reinforcement or punishment
Stimulus comes before the response
Main theorist: B.F. Skinner
Main theorist: Ivan Pavlov
Used in behaviour modification - Rewards and consequences shape learning
Used in associations & emotional responses - Helps explain phobias and conditioned reflexes

CONDITIONED STIMULUS
A conditioned stimulus is a stimulus that we learn to respond to through conditioning. It's the opposite of an unconditioned stimulus which we would naturally respond to.
DEFINITION
A conditioned stimulus is a previously neutral stimulus that initially had no meaning. However, now that it had become paired with another object that does have meaning, then it begins to have significance. A neutral stimulus that has been repeatedly associated with a meaningful stimulus, will eventually have meaning too.
EXAMPLES
The Recess Bell: Children around the world have been conditioned to learn that a ringing bell at school means it's time to go out for lunch (and have some freedom from learning). Here, a previously neutral stimulus (a ringing bell) has come to be associated with a certain activity (leaving the classroom for recess).

UNCONDITIONED STIMULUS
An unconditioned stimulus is a type of stimulus that leads to an automatic response. It is the opposite of a conditioned stimulus where the response is learned, rather than automatic.
DEFINITION
Unconditioned stimuli, such as tickling, the smell of food, dust in the nose, and freshly chopped onion, lead to natural reactions of our bodies that help protect us from potential dangers.
The concept of an unconditioned stimulus is part of the classical conditioning theory in psychology (a part of the broader behaviorist theory).
EXAMPLE
Tickling: When someone tickles us, we usually respond with what feels like uncontrollable giggling. Using the classical conditioning theory of psychology, the tickling action can be considered the unconditioned stimulus. The laughter that it creates is the unconditioned response.
The relationship between the tickle and the laugh is a reflexive one.

NEUTRAL STIMULUS
A neutral stimulus refers to a sensory input or stimulus that does not elicit a specific response or reaction initially.
OVERVIEW
A neutral stimulus lacks any inherent significance or association with a particular response. A neutral stimulus becomes a conditioned stimulus when it is repeatedly paired with an unconditioned stimulus, leading to the development of a conditioned response. Essentially, a neutral stimulus does not evoke a specific response until it is associated with a meaningful stimulus through conditioning.
EXAMPLE
The Bell Stimulus
Initially, the sound of a bell does not naturally evoke a specitic response or reaction. However, if the bell sound is repeatedly paired with the presentation of food, eventually the bell sound alone can elicit salivation. In this example, the bell sound starts as a neutral stimulus but becomes a conditioned stimulus through the process of classical conditioning.

EXTINCTION (PSYCHOLOGY)
In psychology, extinction refers to the gradual weakening and eventual disappearance of a learned behavior.
DEFINITION
Extinction involves the disappearance of a conditioned response to a stimulus. For example, extinction might occur when you are no longer fear of dogs because you have become desensitized to them. Now when you see a dog, you no longer have thoughts of running away.
EXAMPLE
Overcoming trauma: Nate was in a horrible car accident. For many months afterwards, whenever he approached the intersection of the accident he felt anxious. But after a while, he didn't feel anxious any longer and now has no trouble passing through.

SHAPING (PSYCHOLOGY)
DEFINITION
Shaping is a technique that involves rewarding successive approximations to a target behavior.
When the person or animal exhibits a behavior that is similar to the target behavior, it is rewarded. This process is repeated as the behavior exhibited gets closer and closer to the target.
EXAMPLE
Teaching Children Positive
Habits: We use shaping when we teach a child habits like washing their hands or putting away toys.
Generally, a parent will reward them with stickers for completing small tasks. Over time, they will learn instinctively to do the task without receiving the reward.

Observation
A stimulus is given
attention and/or observed.
This can be in real-time, reflection, predictive, or imagined.
Imitation
Some form of imitation of that behavior--in part or its entirety--occurs. This reproduction deepens internalization and elicits evaluation by imitator.
What Is Social
Learning Theory?
Internalization
Initial meaning is created in the mind of the observer.
Definition: Social learning theory is a behavioral theory that posits
that new behaviors can be learned by observing and
imitating others.
Feedback
Feedback loop: ongoing motivation is decided by reflection and perceived relative 'success' (e.g., the effects) of the behavior.

Shaping
• A method involving the "differential reinforcement of successive approximations" (Skinner, 1951)
• First, reinforce anything resembling desired response
• Once established-require closer approximation
• Stop reinforcing previously acceptable responses

Behaviourism vs Other Learning Theories
Behaviourism
Rewards & consequences shape learning and actions over time. Focus on external influences on learning.

Social Learning Theory
People learn by observing others, imitating their actions, & modeling behaviour on mentors & colleagues.

Connectivism
Learning happens through sharing, searching & updating information.
Tools & networks make new ideas
easily accessible.

7
Cognitive Learning Theory
Internal processes like perception, memory & critical thinking help learners make sense of new concepts.
Constructivism
Learners actively build their own understanding by engaging with hands-on tasks & problem-solving.
Experiential Learning Cycle
Learning is the process of feeling, observing, thinking & doing. Focus on internal growth & personal understanding.

Techniques for encouraging & discouraging specific behaviours.
Pavlov's approach is classical conditioning. Events become associated with actions through repetition.
Skinner's approach is operant conditioning. Actions are encouraged or discouraged through reinforcement and punishments.

Kep Concepts in Behavioural
Learning Theory
Stimulus Control
Cues that cause specific responses or behaviours. Central to classical conditioning.
Neutral stimuli have no effect until paired with an outcome.
Generalisation is when people respond to similar cues.
Discrimination is when people only respond to very specific cues.
Behaviour Modification
Shaping behaviour through rewards & consequences.
Central to operant conditioning.
Reinforcement is encouraging behaviours, making them more likely to be repeated.
Punishment is discouraging behaviours, making them less likely to be repeated.
Extinction is behaviour stopping when rewards & consequences do.

The Psychology of Motivation
WHY WE DO WHAT WE DO
When you're hungry, you eat. When you're tired, you sleep. When you want a good grade, you study. But what motivates you to get from point A to point B? In other words, why do we do anything?
MOTIVATION
In its most basic sense, motivation is the need or desire to do something.' Understanding what motivation is defined as is completely different
- and much simpler - than understanding what causes motivation.
There are several perspectives used when examining the root cause for motivation, and when taken together, they help us understand what drives us. Here are just a few of them:
Drive-Reduction
Perspective:
Motivation arises as a result of biological needs.
We are compelled to
reduce a need in order to
maintain our bodies
homeostasis - the balance of physiological systems. 2
Example:
A rumbling stomach signals the body that we're hungry,
and the nopd to maintain
balanca motivatas mis to oat
Optimal Arousal
Perspective:
We're motivated to maintain a balance between stimulation and
relaxation so as to avoid boredom and stress
Example:
Adrenaline junkies love to skydive, but tamer individuals preter a trip to the movies.
Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Perspective:
This hierarchy is a five-tier mode
of human needs that is ofter illustrated as a pyramid. Needs lower on the pyramid - the most basic - must be satisfied before you can advance to the next level.
Most psychologists recognize we can move around the pyramid pretty fluidly, but the concept of needing to meet basic needs before attaining higher-level goals is widely accepted. 3
INTRINSIC VS. EXTRINSIC
It's important to note the difference between internal motivating factors and external ones, which can encourage or discourage behavior.
EXTRINSIC (EXTERNAL)
Motivation comes from the expectation of punishment or reward.
INTRINSIC INTERNAL
Motivation comes from finding pleasure in the activity itself.'

Incentive Theory of Motivation
The incentive theory suggests that people are motivated to do things because of external rewards. For example, you might be motivated to go to work each day for the monetary reward of being paid. Behavioural learning concepts such as association and reinforcement play an important role in this theory of motivation.

TYPES OF MOTIVATION
Motivation refers to the underlying cause of human action. In psychology, all human actions are seen to have a base cause, or motivation, that explain why we do what we do.
EXTRINSIC MOTIVATION
Extrinsic motivation refers to the drive to engage in an activity in order to obtain external rewards or avoid negative consequences, rather than for the enjoyment or personal satisfaction of the activity itself. It is typically driven by external factors such as money, recognition, or pressure from others.
INTRINSIC
MOTIUTAION
Intrinsic motivation refers to the inherent drive and enjoyment that comes from engaging in an activity for its own sake, rather than for external rewards or pressure. It is characterized by a sense of personal fulfillment, interest, and satisfaction that arises from within the individual.

WHAT IS MOTIVATION?
Motivation is the ability to initiate and persist at a certain task.
MOTIVATION
MOTIVATION MOUNTAIN
Motivation directs our attention, effort, and intensity, which drives our behaviors.
MOTIVATION IS A CHOICE
We choose our reasons for participating in sport. Motivation is within our control - action often precedes motivation!
INTERNAL & EXTERNAL
Rewards are not bad, however, internal motivators will have longer benefits, including more satisfaction overall in sport.
MAKE A LIST
Write down all the reasons you participate in sport. Separate by internal and external motivations. Do you have more of one type?
WHAT IS YOUR WHY?
Our motivation should be connected back to our "why." Reflect on what initially made you interested in your sport.

Below you will find examples of both, try to think about times where you are motivated by intrinsic & extrinsic factors...

Trophies/Titles
Doing something for the team
Praise/Recognition
Focused on the process over the outcome
FoCUS

Instinct theory of motivation
The instinct theory of motivation is a psychological perspective that suggests that human behavior is primarily driven by innate, biological instincts. These instincts are thought to be hardwired into our brains through evolution and guide our actions to meet specific biological needs. While the instinct theory has fallen out of favor in contemporary psychology, it played a significant role in shaping our understanding of motivation and behavior.

INSTINCT THEORY OF MOTIVATION
The instinct theory of motivation argues that our motivational instincts are passed down from our parents through hereditary factors.
DEFINITION
The instinct theory states that our motivations and behavior are compelled by a distinct set of instincts that are internally fixed.
Our biological or natural urges are in control of how we act, and these are the motivating force behind our actions.
KEY CONCEPTS
• Motivation is predetermined by biological drives and not subject to change.
• Key drivers of our actions include the instincts to seek out food, shelter, and reproduction
• We lack agency because our innate drives - for food, shelter, protection, community, sex, etc.
- cannot be denied.

THE PSYCHOLOGY OF MOTIVATION
THE ULTIMATE SUCCESS SHEET
The Two Types of Motivation
Comes from within the individual, driven by personal interest, enjoyment, or satisfaction in the task itself.
Comes from external factors or rewards, such as money, grades, recognition, or praise.
Intrinsic
Motivation
Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs
Astengestand Medi
Extrinsic Motivation
Self-Determination Theory (SDT)
Developed by Edward Deci and Richard Ryan, SDT focuses on the degree to which an individual's behavior is self-motivated and self-determined.
It emphasizes three innate needs:
Abraham Maslow proposed that human motivation is based on individuals seeking to fulfill a hierarchy of needs, starting from the most basic (physiological) to higher-level needs (self-actualization).
Autonomy (Control over one's actions)
Competence
(Mastery of tasks and learning new skills)
Relatedness (Connection with others
Expectancy Theory
Goal Setting Theory
Suggests that motivation is influenced by an individual's expectation that their effort will lead to a desired outcome, the value they place on that outcome, and the perceived likelihood that their effort will lead to the expected outcome.
Proposes that setting specific, challenging, but attainable goals can motivate individuals and improve performance, especially it feedback is provided and the goals are important to the individual.
The Role of Environment
Personal Interests and Values
The environment, including workplace culture, social groups, and educational settings, can greatly influence an individual's motivation through support, resources, and
Personal interests and values are key drivers of intrinsic motivation, leading to higher engagement and satisfaction in activities that align with an individual's passions and beliefs.

Decline of grand theories of motivation
Will
Instinct
Drive
The philosophical study of the will turned out to be a dead end that explained very little about motivation; it raised more questions than it answered.
The physiological study of the instinct proved to be an intellectual dead end as well; it
became clear that
"naming is not explaining".
Overly limited in scope.
With its rejection came disillusionment with grand theories in general, though several additional grand motivational principles emerged with some success, including incentive and arousal.
Based on Reeve (2015, Ch 2, PP. 36-37)

Theories of Motivation The Good, the Bad and the Ugly
THE GOOD
Still relevant and effective:
Self-
Determination
Theory
People thrive when they feel autonomy, competence, and connection.
Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory
Hygiene factors prevent dissatisfaction, but other factors create engagement
McClelland's
Theory of Needs People are driven by achievement, power, or affiliation
!
THE BAD
Popular but flawed:
Carrot and Stick
Rewards may create short-term compliance but undermine long-term engagement.
THE UGLY
Counterproductive
Overuse of perks and bonuses
Intrinsic motivation gets crowded out when the focus shifts to "what's in it for me?"
Leading with fear
Kills creativity, trust, and sustainable performance.
Maslow's
Hierarchy Needs don't always follow a fixed order; real-life motivation is more dynamic.
Theory X vs. Y
Many claim to lead with Theory Y, while systems still reflect control and mistrust.
Forced rankings
Undermines collaboration and psychological safety.

Motivation Cycle
Needs
At the beginning of the motivation cycle, a persor has a need or desire that they want to fulfill
Drive
Once a person has identified a need, they develop a drive to fulfill it.
Action
In this stage, a person takes action to fulfill their need or desire.
Feedback
Feedback is an essential component of the motivation cycle. It provides a person with information about their progress towards their goal and helps them adjust their approach if necessary.
Goal Attainment
The final stage of the motivation cycle is goal attainment. This occurs when a person has successfully fulfilled their need or desire.

Difference between Need and Drive



NEED

DRIVE
Needs are inherent psychological states that represent a lack or deficiency within an individual.
These needs can be physiological (e.g., hunger, thirst, sleep), psychological (e.g., need for
achievement, affiliation, autonomy), or social (e.g., need for belongingness, acceptance).

Drives are the
psychological forces or states of arousal that arise from unsatisfied needs.
Drives prompt individuals to engage in behaviors aimed at reducing or alleviating the tension caused by unmet needs.

McClelland's Theory of Needs
McClelland's Theory of Needs, also known as the Three Needs Theory, was introduced by David McClelland in the 1950s as a response to the prevailing psychological theories of his time. He believed that the commonly accepted theories of motivation, such as Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Freudian theory, did not sufficiently explain the various motives that drive human behavior. McClelland's theory identifies three distinct needs that influence individuals: the need for achievement (nAch), the need for affiliation (nAff), and the need for power (nPow).

2. Need for Power (nPow)
(nPow) centers on having control over others and making an impact. It's about influencing and leading people rather than achieving specific goals. Individuals with high now desire their ideas to be implemented and value status and prestige. This need is often reflected in their pursuit of expensive lifestyles and symbols of success.

OPPONENT-PROCESS THEORY OF EMOTION:
The Opponent-Process Theory of Emotion, proposed by Richard Solomon and John Corbit, suggests that emotions are regulated in opposing pairs, such as pleasure-pain or fear-relief. When one emotion is experienced, an opposing emotion is triggered afterward. Over time, the initial emotional response weakens, while the opposing emotion strengthens. This model explains phenomena like addiction or thrill-seeking, where the primary pleasurable response diminishes, and the withdrawal or relief response intensifies with repeated exposure.

Dual-Process Theory
Dual-Process Theory postulates two cognitive systems, System 1 and System 2, influencing human thinking. System 1 is fast and intuitive but prone to biases, while System 2 is slow and analytical.
Understanding these systems has benefits in decision-making and behavioral insights, but it poses challenges like bias recognition. It impacts psychology research and education, finding applications in behavioral economics, psychology, and education.

SUMMARY
DUAL PROCESS THEORY
KEY IDEA
Dual process theory posits two distinct systems for processing information in the human brain.
System 1: Automatic & quick, little or no effort, no sense of voluntary control, relies on heuristics.
System 2: Deliberate & conscious, requires effort and concentration to manage complex calculations, reasoning, and problem-solving.
In the context of clinical reasoning, novices rely heavily on System 2 thinking, whereas more advanced learners often rely on System 1.
Masterful diagnosticians use both systems: they rely on System 1 for the majority of cases; however, their expertise allows them to detect when a clinical scenario deviates enough from typical patterns to require System 2 thinking.
THINKING FAST
Thinking fast (System 1) entails instinctive, rapid, and automatic mental processes, with minimal conscious effort. Essential for quick, heuristic decision-making.
In clinical reasoning, this system enables healthcare professionals to make swift, intuitive judgments and decisions, including in urgent or high-pressure sce-narios.
This system requires clinicians to rely on accumulated experience and instinctive understanding for immediate assessments, leading to prompt and often effective responses to patient needs.
THINKING SLOW
Thinking slow (System 2) involves deliberate, analytical, and conscious mental processes, requiring significant effort and concentration. Key for methodi-cal, logical reasoning.
In clinical reasoning, this system is crucial for in-depth analysis, differential diagnosis, and evi-dence-based decision-making, especially in complex or atypical cases.
This system enables clinicians to engage in thorough evaluation and consideration of all factors and possibilities..

A SHORT HISTORY OF ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY
ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY: MILESTONES AND ACHIEVEMENTS
As society's perspective of normal and abnormal rapidly evolves, psychologists find it difficult to classify behaviors into either category. To this day, there is no absolute definition of abnormal psychology because societal norms vary from one culture to the next.
Abnormal psychology concentrates on psychological disorders and how they influence human behavior, particularly when leading to psychopathology.
." Our
helpful timeline outlines how abnormal psychology and its treatment methods have evolved throughout the centuries.

Individuals with mental disorders were often treated at home.
Local parishes began providing financial aid to families impacted by mental illness.
Community mental health programs strove to provide gentle and respectful treatment.
The humanism movement began.
可）
As recognizing mental health disorders became more common during the early Renaissance, hospitals and churches started operating as asylums to provide widespread treatment. 2) The patients in these asylums often had a low quality of care due to overpopulation in the facilities and a staff that lacked knowledge about mental illness. That soon changed with the introduction of scientific questioning during the
humanism movement
Scientific questioning started to overtake the traditional understanding of mental illness during the early Renaissance.
The Renaissance humanism movement began during the 13th and 14th
Centuries. It was a system of education that originated in Italy and eventually spread throughout out other parts of Europe. At the core of the Renaissance humanism movement is the belief that humans should be shown understanding and compassion. (a) During this time, doctors began utilizing the power of suggestion on the human mind, which today is known as hypnosis.
The 18th Century was full of early psychologists who worked hard to educate doctors on mental illnesses and how to appropriately treat them.
Philippe Pinel, a French physician, performed an experiment in 1792 that translated into improved quality of care for patients. He helped deploy moral management, which sought to treat those displaying abnormal behaviors based on their social, individual, and occupational needs. (5)
Commitment to asylums was still considered the norm, and
inhumane treatments were being phased out through education about mental illness.
William Tuke, an English
businessman and philanthropist, opened the York Retreat in England, a house that sought to provide humane treatment for those with mental illnesses. (4)
1808
你
1878
1886
Franz Gall creates a content piece about phrenology, which is the belief that the shape of a person's skull reveals personality traits.
G. Stanley Hall becomes the first American to graduate with a doctorate in psychology. Hall went on to create the American Psychological Association.
Sigmund Freud developed his personality theory, which has continued to impact abnormal psychology treatment methods today.
A large portion of patients who had been kept away from society for decades improved very quickly due to respectful and humane treatment. The moral treatment of patients was highly prioritized, but there was still room for improvements in quality of care provided to patients.
Dorothea Dix played an instrumental role in the field of abnormal psychology during the 19th Century. She investigated the challenges faced by mental health treatment centers and discovered underfunding and an unregulated system contributed to the demise of humane treatment. She lobbied for change and her efforts resulted in the building of asylums for the first time in the United States.
These asylums utilized treatment methods that are considered unethical by todays medical standards, which were later removed from practice. (6)
20TH CENTURY
By the end of World War II, most psychologists specialized in particular subdisciplines, with abnormal psychology being a chosen field of study.
Carl Rogers created client-centered therapy, which seeks to tailor
treatment methods according to the patient's life goals and potential achievements
The first Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders was published.
1952
Abnormal behaviors were viewed according to two perspectives: psychogenic and somatogenic.
Existential philosophers created the existential view, which is a belief that everyone has the freedom to find meaning in life or to take responsibility for actions.
Once hypnotism gained widespread popularity in the 20th Century for its effectiveness in treating abnormal behaviors, the psychogenic perspective became widely accepted.
It's important to note, however, that psychoanalytic treatment metnods showed little promise in being able to treat severely ill patients.
1963
Deinstitutionalization became a common practice in the 20th Century, and many state institutions were shut down.
In 1963, the Community Mental Health Centers Act was created to strengthen the future of quality patient care. As a result, research facilities started garnering substantial financial support, and the idea of community-based care began to flourish. (2)
Psychogenic: the belief that the mental disorder has a psychological origin rather than a physical origin.
Somatogenic: the belief that the mental disorder is derived from one or more physiological origins rather than a psychogenic origin.
ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY TREATMENT TODAY
Research indicates Omega 3 and Omega 6 fatty acids counteract the onset of psychiatric disorders, particularly paranoid schizophrenia.
Researchers seek to cure "incurable" mental health disorders.
Abnormal psychology research today places a heavy emphasis on the study of brain matter and neurotransmitters Scientists and physicians look closely at hormones and genetics to determine their impact on the human brain. ("
Many forms of prescription medication are used to treat those suffering from mental health issues, but due to extreme withdrawal symptoms and high addiction rates, we are seeing the start of a movement that focuses on holistic treatment methods. (8)
Holistic treatment methods are highly encouraged.
If you're interested in abnormal psychology, consider earning a psychology degree from King University.
Our program will prepare you for careers such as clinical psychologist, neuropsychologist, research psychologist, a clinical social worker, and more.

A QUICK AND SIMPLE WAY TO THINK ABOUT THE BRAIN
Paul D. MacLean, MD, developed the concept of the triune brain in The Triune Brain in Evolution: Role in Paleocere-bral Functions. Rick Hanson, PhD, author of Hardwiring Happiness: The New Brain Science of Contentment, Calm, and Confidence built on this original concept.
In many ways, the brain is considered the most complex of human organs.
But complex doesn't have to mean complicated. Especially when we're trying to explain the brain's different but necessary functions.
Our brain structure can be divided into three layers - the brain stem, the subcortical region, and the cortex.
And each layer can be loosely associated with the reptile, mammal, and primate/human phases of evolution,
So, if you think about it, it's almost as we're carrying a little lizard, a little mouse, and a little monkey inside
And as the brain evolved, so did its capacity to meet the three fundamental needs of any animal ...
Safety, satisfaction, and connection.
Here's a visual...
PRIMATE HUMAN BRAIN
(CORTEX
MAMMALIAN BRAIN (SUBCORTICAL REGION)
REPTILIAN BRAIN (BRAIN STEM
+ CEREBELLUM)
PRIMATE/ HUMAN BRAIN
(CORTEX
The cortex is larger and more sophisticated than the other two layers - thus, we link this part of the brain to primate and human evolution. (In fact, the human cortex has roughly tripled in volume over the last three million years of evolution).
RESPONSIBLE FOR:
Higher mental functions
CORE FUNCTIONS:
Regulating attention, feelings, and desires, complex reasoning, abstract thoughts, imagination, language, empathy
BASIC "NEED":
Connection and attachment to others
WHEN NEED IS MET: We feel LOVE
WHEN NEED IS NOT MET: We experience HEARTACHE
MAMMALIAN BRAIN (SUBCORTICAL REGION)
The subcortical region is associated with mammalian evolution - we might think of it as the little mouse part of the brain.
RESPONSIBLE FOR:
Feelings and memory formation
CORE FUNCTIONS:
Emotions, learning and memory, reward/motivation
BASIC "NEED":
Satisfaction and approaching rewards
WHEN NEED IS MET:
We feel CONTENTMENT
WHEN NEED IS NOT MET: We experience FRUSTRATION
REPTILIAN BRAIN
(BRAIN STEM + CEREBELLUM)
The brain stem is the most ancient part of the brain.
This brain structure shares a similar function to the brain found in simple creatures, like crabs or lizards.
RESPONSIBLE FOR:
Survival and maintenance
CORE FUNCTIONS:
Regulating heartbeat, breathing, and other vital organs
BASIC "NEED":
Safety and avoiding harm
WHEN NEED IS MET:
We feel PEACE
WHEN NEED IS NOT MET:
We experience FEAR

WHAT HAPPENS IN THE BRAIN during a potentially traumatic event?
The brain stem is critical in fast, defensive responses. It's directly connected with the retina.
The retina sends visual information to the brain stem immediately - before higher levels of the brain are even aware of the threat.
Brain stem
If the predator moves closer, the periaqueductal gray initiates a fight or flight response.
The periaqueductal gray activates the sympathetic nervous system.
Heart rate goes up. Blood flow to muscles increases. Blood pressure increases.
Pupils dilate.
Periaqueductal gray (PAG)
Brain stem
But it's not always safe or possible to fight or escape.
That's when a person may enter the freeze response, or feigned death.
Now the periaqueductal gray activates the parasympathetic nervous system as well.
Muscles get tight and freeze. Both gaze and breath may freeze.
This is not a cognitive choice.
These "decisions" are made at the level of the brain stem and the nervous system.
If the predator doesn't move away, the person may shutdown completely.
Heart rate drops. Respiratory rate drops.
Some people stop breathing. Muscles become limp. Metabolism shuts down. Endorphins are released.
The person enters a state of "no pain". They are no longer aware of their surroundings.
174
SHUTDOWN TORAGEE.
During inescapable trauma, this is a very adaptive way for the brain and body to respond.

MAPPING YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM'S
RESPONSE TO TRAUMA
Based on ideas from Stephen Porges, PhD and Deb Dana, LCSW
According to polyvagal theory, the nervous system has three pathways, each designed to protect you.
SYMPATHETIC
Think of ventral vagal as the nervous system's optimal state.
VENTRAL VAGAL
But when you carry a history of trauma, relationships can be particularly triggering, making it difficult to feel safe connections with others.
RAUM
This is a defensive pathway that gets the body to mobilize into a fight or flight response or an attach/cry-for-help response. In this state, we might feel fear, panic, irritation, anger, or even rage.
This is the state from which we can engage socially, and connect and co-regulate with others. In this state, we often feel more calm, curious, grounded, and safe.
So, the nervous system starts seeking out alternative pathways of protection:
DORSAL VAGAL
Understanding these responses can help you recognize when your nervous system is going into "defense mode." Your therapist may be able to help you identify what triggers these responses so that you can develop strategies to manage them and get grounded.

This is a defensive pathway that gets the body to immobilize into a collapse/shutdown response. In this state, we may feel numb, depressed, ashamed, hopeless, or lethargic. We may dissociate.

How Trauma Impacts Four Different Types of Memory
EXPLICIT MEMORY
IMPLICIT MEMORY
SEMANTIC MEMORY
What It Is
The memory of general knowledge and facts.
Example
You remember what a bicycle is.
EPISODIC MEMORY
EMOTIONAL MEMORY
PROCEDURAL MEMORY
What It Is
The autobiographical memory of an event or experience - including the who, what, and where.
Example
You remember who was there and what street you were on when you fell off your bicycle in front of a crowd.
What It Is
The memory of the emotions you felt during an experience.
Example
When a wave of shame or anxiety grabs you the next time you see your bicycle after the big fall.
What It Is
The memory of how to perform a common task without actively thinking
Example
You can ride a bicycle automatically, without having to stop and recall how it's done.
How Trauma Can Affect It
Trauma can prevent information (like words, images, sounds, etc.) from different parts of the brain from combining to make a semantic memory.
Related Brain Area
The temporal lobe and inferior parietal cortex collect information from different brain areas to create semantic memory.
How Trauma Can Affect It
Trauma can shutdown episodic memory and fragment the sequence of events.
How Trauma Can Affect It
After trauma, a person may get triggered and experience painful emotions, often without context.
Related Brain Area
The hippocampus is responsible for creating and recalling episodic memory.
Related Brain Area
The amygdala plays a key role in supporting memory for emotionally charged experiences.
How Trauma Can Affect It
Trauma can change patterns of procedural memory. For example, a person might tense up and unconsciously alter their posture, which could lead to pain or even numbness.
Related Brain Area
The striatum is associated with producing procedural memory and creating new habits.
Temporal lobe
Inferior parietal lobe
Hippocampus
Amygdala

HOW ANGER AFFECTS YOUR BRAIN AND BODY
@ The first spark of anger activates the amygdala before you're even aware of it.
2 The amygdala activates the hypothalamus.
® The hypothalamus signals the pituitary gland by discharging corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH).
The pituitary activates the adrenal glands by releasing adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).
5 The adrenal glands secrete stress hormones like cortisol, adrenaline, and noradrenaline.

HOW ANGER CHANGES YOUR BRAIN
1. Elevated cortisol causes neurons to accept too much calcium through their membrane. A calcium overload can make cells fire too frequently and die.
The hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) are particularly vulnerable to cortisol and these negative effects.
PREFRONTAL CORTEX
HIPPOCAMPUS
Elevated cortisol causes a loss of neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PCF).
Suppressed activity in the PFC prevents you from using your best judgment - it keeps you from making good decisions and planning for the future.
Elevated cortisol kills neurons in the mopocamous ane alsrupts the
creation of new ones. Suppressed activity in the hippocampus weakens
snort-term memory. I also prevents you from forming new memories properly.
(This is why you might not remember what you want to say in an argument.)
2. Too much cortisol will decrease serotonin - that's the hormone that makes you happy. A decrease in serotonin can make you feel anger and pain more easily, as well as increase aggressive behavior and lead to depression.

AMYGDALA
Now the amygdala is ready to turn on the stress response system in your brain and body.
Scientists named this stress response system the "HPA axis" because it consists of the Hypothalamus, the Pituitary gland, and the Adrenal glands.
In this system, a chain reaction of hormones prepares your body to respond to stressors like anger.
Here is how it works:
The amygdala signals

GUILT VS SHAME
Guilt and shame are not the same. Understanding the differences between them can help us work through our negative self-judgments.
When we are better able to grasp the difference between healthy guilt, irrational guilt, and shame, we can begin to halt self-criticism and reject shame messages.
Guilt is often experienced when we act against our values. Shame, on the other hand, is a deeply-held belief about our unworthiness as a person.
Here's a way to visualize it:

APPROPRIATE GUILT (HEALTHY)
IRRATIONAL GUILT (UNHEALTHY)
SHAME
DEFINITION
A feeling of psychological discomfort about
something we've done that is objectively wrong
A feeling of psychological discomfort about something we've done against our irrationally high standards
An intensely painful feeling of being fundamentally flawed
EXAMPLE
Greg hit someone while driving drunk and feels guilty.
Sam forgot his coworker's name and feels terribly guilty about it.
Tommy feels as though he shouldn't take up space in the world and doesn't deserve to exist.
CAUSE OF FEELING
Actions or behaviors that break objective definitions of right and wrong
Actions or behaviors that break irrationally high standards
Innate sense of being worthless or inherently defective
WHEN IT DEVELOPS
We can experience guilt as early as age 3-6.
(Developmentally, guilt is a more mature emotion than shame.)
We can experience guilt as early as age 3-6.
We can experience shame as early as 15 months.
(That's why shame is more deeply wired in our brain and is more difficult to reverse.)
WHY WE FEEL THIS
We act in a way that breaks objective standards of moral behavior.
We act in a way that breaks irrational standards of behavior developed early in childhood to please adult.
We see ourselves as unworthy and deeply flawed.
OUTCOME
Potentially positive
Healthy guilt allows us to seek forgiveness and correct a wrong. It can lead to healing.
Negative
Irrational guilt leads us to emphasize self-punishment over behavior change, trapping us in guilt.
Negative
Shame causes us to fear that we will be rejected, so it tempts us to disconnect from others and avoid what causes us shame.
It could even start us down a path of deeper mental health problems like depression and substance abuse.
RESOLUTION
Appropriate guilt resolves as we repair the damage we caused.
Irrational guilt remains until we correct irrational beliefs.
Shame is internalized and deeply connected to our sense of who we are which makes it more difficult to resolve.
HOW TO WORK WITH
Face the behavior that hurt self and others.
Take responsibility for the harm done.
Seek forgiveness from the person affected.
Change destructive
behavior and attitudes that created the harm.
Reclaim wholeness and heal relationship with the person affected.
Separate and resolve appropriate guilt to uncover irrational guilt.
Practice self-compassion and work to understand that everyone possesses a combination of strengths and weaknesses.
Seek connection with others. Joining a self-help group can offer support.
Exercise self-compassion to shift feelings of shame and move awareness away from self-criticism or proof of inadequacy.
Pursue relationships.
Nurture connections and a sense of belonging with others.

A 4-STEP APPROACH FOR OVERCOMING ANXIETY
In life, you're constantly managing unknowns. But when anxiety takes hold, it can be difficult to face those unknowns and do the things you once enjoyed. So how can you overcome anxiety when it's holding you back?
One way to motivate yourself in the face of anxiety is to build a values-based mindset.
Identify the meaningful parts of life that the anxiety is blocking.
2
Shift the focus away from the anxiety itself toward the meaningful goal.

4 QUESTIONS TO HELP CLIENTS
OVERCOME ANXIETY
Adapted from Kelly McGonigal, PhD
When fear takes hold, it may cause your clients to avoid the activities they most enjoy, or even shy away from the people they hold most dear. But asking clients these four questions can help them move beyond their fear and anxiety.
1
What do you lose when you give in to fear?
Your client may find that their fear causes them to miss opportunities, lose independence, or even neglect their relationships. Identifying those meaningful parts of life that fear blocks can be a powerful motivator.
2
What do you gain by choosing the anxiety-provoking option?
Helping clients envision the self-confidence, meaningful relationships, and positive experiences that are often just on the other side of fear can be a key step in shifting their response.
3
What strategies can help you manage the temporary anxiety?
Mindfulness can be particularly effective in helping clients stay grounded in the face of anxiety. You may try strategies such as bringing awareness to the breath or setting a specific intention.
4
How can you acknowledge your own courage?
Facing fear is a major accomplishment. That's why it can be critical to help your client celebrate their ability to tolerate discomfort, or appreciate their willingness to even try.

- Adapted from Karlen Lyons-Ruth, PhD -
HOW THE NERVOUS SYSTEM RESPONDS TO THE THREAT OF ATTACK
VS
THE THREAT OF ABANDONMENT
As you know, when faced with the threat of attack, the nervous system's first lines of defense are to:
In abandonment trauma, the nervous system has a different defensive response. That's because fighting, fleeing, or freezing won't protect you or help you connect with a caregiver.
FIGHT
Instead, the nervous system's first response is to call out or seek contact.
Sometimes, this doesn't work either. But in early childhood, connection and closeness with a caregiver is a survival need.
FLIGHT
FREEZE
But what happens when the threat to your survival is abandonment?
When an infant or young child does not get the connection they need, they may engage in caretaking behaviors toward their parents in a last-resort effort to secure the relationship.
This can affect their relationships throughout life.
But abandonment trauma doesn't have to be a life sentence. Working with a skilled therapist can help begin the healing process.

How to Work With Shame
Video 3 - Part 1
The Neurobiology of Shame, Part 1:
How Shame Triggers the Body's Shut-Down Response
Dr. Buezynski: Shame is such a powerful emotion, it can trigger the body's shut-down response.
According to Dr. Stephen Porges, this is because the body interprets shame in the same way it interprets another strong emotion.
And when this happens, this is the direct way Stephen disrupts it.
Dr. Porges: Shame is a very interesting emotion or feeling - not everyone feels it, and yet, for a lot of people, it basically determines how they live their life.
Those who feel shame spend their lives trying to protect their body from the feelings associated with shame, literally building a whole set of protective mechanisms.
When people talk about shame, to make sure we're on the same page, I always
"Where are they feeling shame in their body?"
ask them one simple question: Where are they feeling shame in their body?
I have had discussions with some of the people that you're talking to on this webinar series, and I was surprised that some of them used the word shame in a way that's not visceral - not a bodily feeling.
Yet when you talk to people who really experience shame, and it becomes debilitating, they're feeling it.
If you ask them where in the body they feel it, it's going to be below the diaphragm. Shame has physiological responses that are very similar to life threats.
That becomes the critical issue: our body gets challenged with words or feelings, and we try to disappear.
Shame has this whole effect on people - they want to disappear - they don't want to be there, and this very much may lead into dissociation and other sets of issues.
"Shame has physiological responses that are very similar to life threats."
Dr. Buezynski: Do you find that people always know that they feel shame?
Dr. Porges: When we start using psychological constructs to describe bodily feelings, we're in an abyss.
We're in an area where not everyone has the same labeling mechanisms or labels for the feelings that they have.
"When we start using psychological constructs to describe bodily feelings, we're in an abyss."
If you start thinking more in both an evolutionary and a neural-physiological model, you start thinking about adaptive responses and the association of some of those adaptive responses with situations.
If the issue of the initial shaming, or being shamed, is associated with a desire, a physiological reflex ability - not a voluntary desire, but a bodily response, then to get out, to disappear, to become invisible, to shut down, and to dissociate become the subsequent effects.

DRIVE REDUCTION THEORY
Drive reduction theory of motivation states that people are highly motivated to satisfy their physiological and psychological needs.
DEFINITION
Drive reduction theory states that common physiological and biological needs, such as hunger, thirst, warmth, and the urge to survive, are the primary drivers of human motivation. We are motivated to of satisfying these needs in order to restore internal equilibrium (homeostasis'), after which our motivation subsides.
EXAMPLES
• Reducing the drive for hunger:
Your stomach starts grumbling because you are hungry, so you immediately search for something to eat.
• Reducing the drive for warmth:
You are shivering because it is cold, so you put on a jacket or a sweater.

Drive Reduction Theory
Drive Reduction Theory posits that motivation is driven by the need to satisfy physiological needs.
When individuals experience imbalances or deficiencies, they are motivated to take actions to reduce these drives and achieve internal balance (homeostasis). Examples include hunger, thirst, and fatigue, which lead individuals to eat, drink, and rest, respectively. While the theory explains basic biological motivations, it may not fully account for complex human behaviors influenced by external factors and learned needs.

• Holistic
• Emotional: pleasure-pain oriented
• Behavior mediated by "vibes" from past experiences
• Encodes reality into concrete images, metaphors, and narratives
• More rapid processing; oriented toward immediate action
• Self-evidently valid; "experiencing is believing"
SYSTEM 2 CHARACTERISTICS
• Analytical
• Logical; reason oriented
• Behavior mediated by conscious appraisal of events
• Encodes reality in abstract symbols, words, and numbers
• Slower processing; oriented toward delayed action
• Requires justification via logic and evidence

KEY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN
EMOTIONS
VS
Definition
Characteristics
Emotions are intense, short-lived reactions to specific stimuli, encompassing a range of responses such as joy, anger, fear, surprise, and more.
They are often brief and intense, triggered by internal or external events, and accompanied by physiological changes.
Example: Feeling elated after a success or experiencing fear during a thrilling movie.
FEELINGS
Feelings are subjective experiences that arise from emotions, influenced by personal interpretations, beliefs, and experiences.
They are individual and subjective, shaped by personal perceptions, and can be more prolonged than emotions.
Example: Feeling warmth and affection toward a loved one or experiencing embarrassment after a mistake.
VS
MOODS
Moods are sustained emotional states less intense than emotions, coloring our overall disposition over a more extended period.
They are more long-lasting, influencing our outlook and behavior and influenced by various factors such as environment, health, and circumstances.
Example: Waking up feeling cheerful and optimistic, leading to a day filled with enthusiasm, or feeling persistently low and melancholic without a clear cause.

الات
Motivation
Emotions help motivate you to take action.
Communication
You communicate your emotions with others through verbal and nonverbal communication.
Self-Validation
Emotions help you communicate with yourself.
They give you information about a situation or event to inform you that something is happening.
You have automatic action urges connected to each emotion.
Verbal communication is the words you say.
These action urges can help you to react quickly to protect yourself. They also motivate you to work toward goals or overcome challenges.
Nonverbal communication might include facial expressions, voice tone and volume, and body language such as gestures and posture.
At times, you might have a "gut feeling" about something and this can prompt you to check the facts about the situation.
Emotions expressed through verbal and nonverbal communication influence
It is important to remember that Not All Feelings Are Facts. A big emotion can be a helpful signal to check the facts about the situation.

INSTINCT THEORY OF MOTIVATION
The instinct theory of motivation argues that our motivational instincts are passed down from our parents through hereditary factors.
DEFINITION
The instinct theory states that our motivations and behavior are compelled by a distinct set of instincts that are internally fixed.
Our biological or natural urges are in control of how we act, and these are the motivating force behind our actions.
KEY CONCEPTS
• Motivation is predetermined by biological drives and not subject to change.
• Key drivers of our actions include the instincts to seek out food, shelter, and reproduction
• We lack agency because our innate drives - for food, shelter, protection, community, sex, etc.
- cannot be denied.

How self determination boosts motivation
Intrinsic
motivation
Volitional engagement in behavior with a relaxed
willingness to act with full and
unconflicted approval, is the
cornerstone of intrinsic
motivation.
Self-determination theory
distinguishes between
intrinsic and extrinsic
motivation
Extrinsic
motivation
Controlled regulation by inputs such as task-contingent rewards,
deadlines, threats of punishment,
surveillance, and punishments
are the drivers of extrinsic
motivation.
At the core of self-determination theory is that people need to feel autonomous, competent, and related to others in order function fully in life and in the workplace

Hippocampus and Long-Term Memory
Formation
销
The brain stores explicit memories in two main places, the hippocampal formation and the neocortex.
The hippocampus is a part of the brain known to be required for long-term memory formation.
고
Lesions to the hippocampus have been canonically thought to prevent the
consolidation from short-term to long-term memory.
It serves to reactivate patterns of cortical activity that encode memory content, hence resulting in
an experience of a memory.
Some studies say that the hippocampus will always be required to retrieve long-term episodic memories.
Other studies also reveal that the hippocampus can form active memories quickly while the cortex helps stabilize these memories.

ENCODING (PSYCHOLOGY)
Refers to the processing and making meaning of of raw inputs of information in the mind.
1. ACOUSTIC
Inputting sounds or spoken words into memory. Acoustic inputs can be processed in working memory or placed in long-term storage.
2. VISUAL
Processing visual stimuli in iconic memory, which decays quickly; most visual stimuli are not committed to long-term memory.
3. TACTILE
Processing information regarding how something feels including texture, temperature, vibrations, and pain. The sense of taste is also tactile.
4. SEMANTIC
Involves processing the meaning of concepts and declarative information in working memory. It can be placed in long-term storage.

SEMANTIC ENCODING
Semantic encoding refers to the process of converting sensory input into meaningful representations in memory.
DEFINITION
EXAMPLE
According to Bedford (2020),
"
...semantic encoding is the processing and encoding of sensory input that has a particular meaning, or that can be applied to a context" (p. 122).
A semantic encoding example is when you meet a new person and to remember their name, you tell yourself that this is the third person named "Ann" you've met this year - this simple story acts as an anecdote you can use during memory recall.

ELABORATIVE ENCODING
Elaborative encoding is a method for improving memory through verbal or visual associations and explanations.
DEFINITION
Elaborative encoding is based on the idea that thoughts and concepts can be better stored in the brain through forming associations between related pieces of information, attaching explanations to newly acquired facts, and actively engaging with material by creating meaningful categories.
EXAMPLE
Studying: When learning new things, we typically use elaborative encoding to associate new material with previously-learned content.
Doing so, we can better remember and recall the information because it is now associated with something we know well.

Short-term Memory and the Brain
Frontal Lobe
Parietal Lobe
Medial Temporal Lobe
Frontal Lobe
Parietal Lobe
Medial Temporal Lobe
Frontal lobe injury can lead to impairments in short-term memory, often as a consequence of attention deficits and impaired memory retrieval processes.
The frontal lobe is functionally dissociated such that verbal short-term memory tasks selectively activate the left frontal cortex, while spatial short-term memory tasks activate the right posterior dorsal frontal cortex.
The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is one region of the frontal lobe that plays a crucial role in short-term memory and neuroimaging studies have shown that when people are performing tasks to hold items in short-term memory, the PFC becomes active.
Recent research has indi-
-cated that the parietal lobe plays an important role in generating both verbal and visual short-term memory.
Verbal and visual short-term memory seems to rely on the left parietal cortex, while spatial short-term memory involves the right parietal cortex.
The medial temporal lobe is heavily implicated in the functioning of long-term memory, but recent findings have suggested it plays a role in the active maintenance of novel information in short-term memory.
One of the most well-studied regions of the MTL is the hip-pocampus, which plays an important role in consolidating information within the neocortex from short-term to long-term memory.

MEMORY CHUNKING
Chunking is a memorization technique. It refers to grouping similar bits of information together to make them easier to remember.
DEFINITION & TYPES
EXAMPLE
"Chunking is the process whereby the brain perceives several items of information as a single item." (Oram & Wilson, 2010)
Two types of chunking are:
• Pattern chunking: remembering patterns as a chunk of information.
• Categorical chunking:
remembering categories as individual items.
• Learning a Guitar Tune: It helps to group sequential notes that form meaningful parts of a song when learning how to play guitar tune.
• Phonics: When learning to read, children memorize repeated chunks of letters, such as 'ing', 'ish' and 'pre' This makes it easier for them to sound out words in parts rather than every single letter.

ROTE MEMORIZATION
The process of learning something through repetition. It involves repeating information over and over again until it becomes firmly embedded in memory.
PROS & CONS
• Pros: Quick learning, improved accuracy, and better recall.
Also is good for remembering base knowledge like the times tables.
• Cons: Shallow learning, doesn't support higher-level
understanding, and tends to be easily forgotten without spaced repetition to refresh memory.
ROTE US
MEANINGFUL
• Rote memorization involves repetition and drill-type exercises to learn new information. It involves repeating something over and over until it is memorized.
• Meaningful learning involves making connections between different topics or ideas and deeply comprehending material for it to be remembered.

WORKING MEMORY
Working memory refers to the parts of human memory dedicated to processing and utilizing temporary (or 'short-term) information.
DEFINITION
"[Working memory is] the processes that we use to make sense of, modify, interpret, and store
information in short term memory are known as working memory."
(University of Minnesota, 2010, p.
318)
EXAMPLES
• When meeting someone for the first time, we may repeat their name silently in the hopes of being able to remember it later.
• A graphic designer trying to visualize a possible logo design in their mind's eye.
• A beginning reader trying to recall the pronunciation of specific blends when encountering an unfamiliar word.

SHORT-TERM MEMORY
DEFINITION
Short-term memory temporarily holds and processes information for 15-30 seconds. It has a limited capacity, often cited as / 2 items without the use of mnemonic techniques. Information in short-term memory can either fade due to decay, be displaced, or get transferred to long-term memory through processes like rehearsal.
HELPFULPROFESSOR.COM
EXAMPLES
• Dialing a Phone Number:
After hearing or seeing a new phone number, you keep it in mind just long enough to dial it.
• Remembering a Short
Shopping List: Before grabbing a notepad, you try to mentally recall a few items you need from the store during your quick trip.

4 MEMORY BIASES
THAT CAN HELP YOU CREATE
UNFORGETTABLE ELEARNING
Our minds work in mysterious ways. There's a load of memory biases that influence the way we retain and recall information, so why not take advantage of these to create eLearning that won't be forgotten?
1
Bizarreness
Effect
If something jumps out at you on a page, you are going to remember it.
A man in a suit is forgettable, but a fish in a suit? That will stick with you for a while.
Strange, unusual and extraordinary information is easier to retain, so make your most important information stand out.
2 Hutur
Effect
If something makes us crack a smile, it won't be forgotten anytime soon. If there isn't a giggle, there is a better chance you will forget it.
Make people laugh and they'll remember more and have a damn good time.
PURE
learning
Putting the learning back into eLearning www.purelearning.com.au
3
Generation
Effect
Coming to conclusions through our own experiences are the moments that really stick in our mind.
Information handed to us on a plate?
Not so much.
Create the sense that users are driving their own learning experience, not being spoon-fed the information.
Picture
4 Superiority Effect
We can recall visuals easily so information through pictures and infographics (like this one) aren't going to be forgotten quickly. However, large slabs of text will be.
Provide people with visual aids to enhance their knowledge retention.

The Working Memory Model (Baddeley and Hitch, 1974, 2000)
Central Executive
Controls information flow, sets goals, and directs attention.
C. Episodic
Buffer
Combines sounds, visuals, and long-term memories into short, temporary experiences with limited capacity.
) Phonological
LooP
Briefly stores and rehearses verbal content (e.g., speech sounds, words).
In 1974, Alan Baddeley &
Graham Hitch's influential
model revolutionized work-
ing memory, replacing the single storehouse with a
multi-component system.
(Later revised in 2000).
Fi, Visuospatial
* Sketchpad
Holds and manipulates visual and spatial information, like a mental canvas.
Phonological store:
Temporarily holds auditory information.
Articulatory rehearsal process:
Repeats sounds in mind to remember.

How
MEMORY
works
Our memories aive us a sense of self and make us who we are. However, our memories are more than just files in a tiling cabinet. wnlle your tirst day at school may seem like a single memory, it's actually a complex construction of multiple memories that span your brain.
Here's a look at how your memory works and how you can improve it:
OVERVIEW
There are three stages to

High-powered brain foods provide sustained energy, thus they typically include complex carbohydrates, fiber, lean protein, and some fat. Brain foods also power your entire body, including the heart and vascular system, meaning they are low in cholesterol and saturated fat, high in omega-3 fatty acids and minimally processed.

HOW TO APPLY THAT KNOWLEDGE
While memory tends to lapse with age, stress or poor health, there are ways to improve it through various strategies, mental exercises, and use of your surroundings.
Drink In Moderation
Alcohol effects the brain cells and their ability to
Keep Moving
Exercise helps to keep the brain and body healthy
Visualisation & Association
Attach images to words to assist in recall by linking to things already familiar
Name Games
Reneat names back after hearing them to help long-term recall
Chunking
Broak thinds down inio smaller parts making them easier to remember
Using locations or sequencing to remember things
Pay Attention
Solid encoding requires proper focus and attention to surroundings and actions.
Environment
Use or manipulate your surroundings to assist in recall and provide visual stimulation and cues.
Practice & Repetition
Repetition of electrical patterns in the brain creates stronger memories and faster recall.

LINGUISTIC RELATIVITY
Linguistic relativity, often referred to as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, is a linguistics theory that language can shape our perceptions of reality and control our thoughts.
DEFINITION
According to the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, language's structure and content have the power to direct one's thoughts by affecting how we comprehend reality. This idea implies that language usage patterns can determine a person's and culture's approach and attitude toward various situations.
EXAMPLE
Inuit words for Snow: Inuit language speakers have numerous phrases to describe snow.
Therefore, an individual speaking this dialect may view ice sheets differently than someone using English with simpler and more Limited terminology regarding snow and ice.

LINGUISTIC DETERMINISM
Linguistic determinism posits that language determines the way a person sees the world.
EXAMPLES
• Language Shapes Expressiveness:
Some people that are normally quite reserved and calm might notice that they become much more expressive when speaking Spanish.
• Missing the Bus: The Hopi language does not conceptualize time as being divided into measurable units, which makes adhering to rigid schedules in English-speaking cultures difficult to understand.
COMPARISON
• Linguistic determinism believes that the structure and vocabulary of a language determines people's thoughts and views, revealing cultural differences across language groups.
• Linguistic relativity argues that the differences in language systems among individuals or cultures can shape and influence their perception and understanding of the world, but is not deterministic.

Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis
The Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis, also known as linguistic relativity, is a captivating theory in the field of linguistics and cognitive science that posits that the language we speak can shape and influence our thoughts, perceptions, and even our cultural perspectives. This hypothesis challenges the conventional notion of a universal human cognition and highlights the profound impact of language on our understanding of the world.

SAPIR-WHORF HYPOTHESIS
The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis states that a person's perception of the world and how they experience the world is determined and influenced by the language that they speak.
DEFINITION
"Every language is a vast pattern-system, different from others, in which are culturally ordained the forms and categories by which the personality not only communicates, but also analyzes nature, notices or neglects types of relationship and phenomena, channels his reasoning, and builds the house of his consciousness" Whorf,
2021, p. 252).
EXAMPLES
• Constructions of gender in language: Many languages are
"gendered", creating word
associations that pertain to the roles of men or women in society.
• Perceptions of time in language: How the tenses are structured in a language may dictate how people perceive the concept of time.

What Is A Heuristic And Why It Matters
As highlighted by German psychologist Gerd Gigerenzer in the paper "Heuristic Decision Making," the term heuristic is of Greek origin, meaning "serving to find out or discover." More precisely, a heuristic is a fast and accurate way to make decisions in the real world, which is driven by uncertainty.

What Is Bounded Rationality?
Bounded rationality is a concept attributed to Herbert Simon, an economist and political scientist interested in decision-making and how we make decisions in the real world. In fact, he believed that rather than optimizing (which was the mainstream view in the past decades) humans follow what he called satisficing: satisfy and suffice.

9.24 Answers to problems in Figure 9.19
Problem B is solved by going outside of the grid formed by the dots. Most participants fail to hit on this solution because of a perceptual set imposed by the grid arrange-ment. To arrange 6 matches into 4 equilateral triangles in Problem C, the matches have to be assembled into a three-dimensional pyramid. Most participants implicitly assume the matches must lie flat.

FUNCTIONAL FIXEDNESS
Functional fixedness refers to rigidity in problem-solving, characterized by a tendency to think of things only in terms of their usual functions.
COMPARISON
Functional fixedness prevents people from thinking laterally. People are fixated on the formal functions of objects and miss other ways they can be used.
The opposite of functional fixedness is cognitive flexibility, which refers to the ability to use things in unusual or innovative ways. Cognitive flexibility is one of the most valuable skills that businesses are looking for in potential employees.
EXAMPLE: HAMMERS
What do you do if you can't find a hammer?
If you spend a lot of time searching for it in your toolbox or on a shelf in the garage, you might have a bad case of functional fixedness.
Perhaps you could the brick that's laying right outside the door on the porch. Bricks could, if you exercise some cognitive flexibility, be quite useful as hammers, as well.

Functional Fixedness
A Major Barrier to Problem Solving
Functional fixedness is the tendency to see objects only for their typical uses, limiting creative problem-solving. For instance, a butter knife could serve as a screwdriver in certain situations, but many overlook this because they are
"fixed" on its usual function. The string problem illustrates how overcoming functional fixedness-by using pliers as a weight-can lead to a solution.

Mental Sets
Why We Stick to Familiar Solutions
A mental set is the tendency to rely on solutions that worked before, even when they may not be suitable for the current problem. This restricts flexibility and limits the exploration of new approaches. For example, sticking to a common problem-solving method may hinder progress, but thinking outside the box-like drawing lines beyond the dots-can lead to a solution.

Problem solving is finding solutions to challenges, However, sometimes solutions can be hard to find due to issues like improper arrangement of elements or cognitive barriers.
Insightful problem solving may not always be successful due to cognitive tendencies that act automatically without conscious awareness.

Insight Problem Example
The Challenge of Finding Solutions
Imagine two strings hanging from the ceiling, but they're too far apart to reach both at once. Nearby, there's a table with pliers. The goal is to tie the strings together. The solution may seem obvious, but the problem persists due to thinking patterns that prevent people from considering non-obvious solutions, like using the pliers as a weight. This shows how problem-solving can fail when we overlook creative solutions.

Confirmation Bias
How Our Beliefs Can Cloud Judgment
Confirmation bias is the tendency to favor information that supports our existing beliefs while disregarding opposing evidence. This bias can hinder problem-solving and decision-making.
For example, someone who believes they are good at multitasking may focus on past successes and ignore the dangers, like texting while driving. This can lead to poor decisions by preventing an objective view of the situation.

Example of a mental set: The 9 Dots Problem
When people try to solve this problem, a mental set causes them to think of the dots as representing a box, and they try to draw the line while staying in the box.
The only way to connect all nine dots without lifting the pencil from the paper is to draw the lines so they extend out of the box of dots-literally "thinking outside the box."

©KRISETINA SZEROVAY
"IF AN ORGANISM CARRIES A „SMALL-SCALE MODEL" OF EXTERNAL REALITY AND OF ITS POSSIBLE ACTIONS WITHIN ITS HEAD, IT IS ABLE TO TRY OUT VARIOUS ALTERNATIVES, CONCLUDE WHICH IS THE BEST OF THEM, REACT TO FUTURE SITUATIONS BEFORE THEY ARISE, UTILIZE THE KNOWLEDGE OF PAST EVENTS IN DEALING WITH THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE."

"AMENTAL MODEL REPRESENTS A THOUGHT PROCESS FOR HOW SOMETHING WORKS." (SUSAN CAREY)

HOW DOES THIS APPLY TO UX DESIGN?
BASED ON
• EXPERIENCE WITH DIGITAL PRODUCTS IN GENERAL DEXPERIENCE WITH SIMILAR APPS
・INTWITION
• WHAT THE USER HEARD/READ ABOUT IT
+ EXPERIENCE WITH THIS GIVEN APP (OBVIOUSLY, THIS ONLY APPLIES
TO RETURNING USERS)
SOFTWARE/ APPLICATION

IT'S A MATCH!

CONCEPTUAL MODEL:
"THE ACTUAL MODEL THAT IS GIVEN TO THE PERSON THROUGH THE DESIGN AND INTERFACE OF THE ACTUAL PRODUCT "(SUSAN M. WEINSCHENK)

ABOUT THE USERS' MENTAL MODELS?
• CONDUCT UX RESEARCH, LISTEN 2 OBSERVE (EG. WHAT ARE THE USER'S EXPECTATIONS?

ANCHORING & ADJUSTMENT
HEURISTIC
The anchoring and adjustment heuristic is when we rely heavily on a starting point or initial information when making estimates or decisions.
AVAILABILITY HEURISTIC
The availability heuristic is when we think something is more likely to happen because we remember it easily or it's fresh in our minds.
All the information
Information you use to make the decision about an event
• When it happened
• How often it happens
• Its impact
• Media coverage about it
I saw on the news that a flight crashed! It is unsafe to ride in airplanes. I will never fly again!

because it looks like a better deal!

REPRESENTATIVENESS HEURISTIC
The representativeness heuristic is when we make judgments based on stereotypes and how similar something or someone is to our idea of what they should look like.

(a) Doctor

7. Survivorship Bias
What is it: The error of focusing only on successes while ignoring the many failures that never made it into view.
How to avoid it: Study the full set of outcomes—pay attention to what's missing, not just what's visible.

COGNITIVE BIASES IN UX
Authority Bias
People tend to listen to those who are in a position of authority. Authority bias is the tendency to attribute greater accuracy to the opinion to a person who is an authority figure.
People are then more influenced by that
"authority" opinion because it is coming from a person who is perceived to have that additional authority. Just because a person has a prestigious title, that does not mean they necessarily know more than others.

COGNITIVE BIASES IN UX}
Experimenter Bias
What happens with experimenter bias is that when a researcher is sharing their research findings with others, they tend to believe and share information that only agrees with their expectations. In other words, they promote and talk about things that were aligned with what they expected in that conversation or research study, and neglect to mention the parts that do not agree with their experiment or hypothesis.

COGNITIVE BIASES IN UX,
Courtesy Bias
When a person is exhibiting courtesy bias, he or she does not fully state their opinion once an opinion has been stated by someone in the group.
Even if a person does not agree, they don't say anything contrary because they don't want to offend others or look bad in front of the group.
This is a common phenomenon in focus groups and can often lead to "groupthink." This is why one-on-one interviews is the preferred method to gather individual, in-depth insights.

50 COGNITIVE BIASES
TO BE AWARE OF
SO YOU CAN BE THE VERY BEST VERSION OF YOU
Memory
Social
Learning
Belief
Money
Politics
Fundamental
Attribution Error
We judge others on their personality or fundamental character, but we judge ourselves on the situation.
Self-Serving
Bias
Our failures are situational, but our successes are our responsibility.
In-Group Favoritism
We favor people who are in our in-group as opposed to an out-group.
Bandwagon
Effect
Ideas, fads, and beliefs grow as more people adopt them.
Groupthink
Due to a desire for conformity and harmony in the group, we make irrational decisions, often to minimize conflict.
Sally is late to class; she's lazy. You're late to class; it was a bad morning.
Halo
Effect
If you see a person as having a positive trait, that positive impression will spill over into their other traits. (This also works for negative traits.)
You won that award due to hard work rather than help or luck. Meanwhile, you failed a test because you hadn't gotten enough sleep.
Moral Luck
Better moral standing happens due to a positive outcome; worse moral standing happens due to a negative outcome.
Francis is in your church, so you like Francis more than Sally.
False
Consensus
We believe more people agree with us than is actually the case.
Sally believes fidget spinners help her children. Francis does, too.
Curse of Knowledge
Once we know something, we assume everyone else knows it, too.
Sally wants to go get ice cream. Francis wants to shop for T-shirts. You suggest getting T-shirts with pictures of ice cream on them.
Spotlight
Effect
We overestimate how much! people are paying attention to our behavior and appearance.
"Taylor could never be mean;
she's so cute!"
"X culture won X war because they were morally superior to the losers."
"Everybody thinks that!"
Alice is a teacher and struggles to understand the perspective of her new students.
Sally is worried everyone's going to notice how lame her ice cream T-shirt is.

<!-- text extract start -->

Availability
Heuristic
We rely on immediate examples that come to mind while making judgments.
When trying to decide on which store to visit, you choose the one you most recently saw an ad for.
Forer Effect
(aka Barnum Effect)
We easily attribute our personalities to vague statements, even if they can apply to a wide range of people
"This horoscope is so accurate!"
Reactance
We do the opposite of what we're told, especially when we perceive threats to personal freedoms.
One of Alice's students refuses to do his homework, even though both she and his parents tell him to.
Defensive Attribution
As a witness who secretly fears being vulnerable to a serious mishap, we will blame the victim less and attacker more if we relate to the victim.
Just-World Hypothesis
We tend to believe the world is just; therefore, we assume acts of injustice are deserved.
Sally sat too long at a green light because she was playing with her phone. She got rear-ended. Greg, who is known to text and drive, got out and yelled at the person who smacked into her.
Dunning-Kruger
Effect
The less you know, the more confident you are. The more you know, the less confident you are
"Sally's purse was stolen because she was mean to Francis about their T-shirt and had bad karma."
Anchoring
We rely heavily on the first piece of information introduced when making decisions.
Francis confidently assures the group that there's no kelp in ice cream. They do not work in the dairy industry.
Confirmation
Bias
We tend to find and remember information that confirms our perceptions.
"That's 50% off? It must be a great deal."
Backfire
Effect
Disproving evidence sometimes has the unwarranted effect of confirming our beliefs.
You can confirm a conspiracy theory based on scant evidence while ignoring contrary evidence.
The evidence that disproves your conspiracy theory was probably faked by the goverment.
Naive
Realism
We believe that we observe objective reality and that other people are irrational, uninformed, or biased.
"I see the world as it really is
— other people are dumb."
Automation
Bias
We rely on automated systems, sometimes trusting too much in the automated correction of actually correct decisions.
Your phone auto-corrects "its" to "it's," so you assume it's right.
Third-Person
Effect
We believe that others are more affected by mass media consumption than we ourselves are.
"You've clearly been brainwashed by the media!"
Naïve
Cynicism
We believe that we observe objective reality and that other people have a higher egocentric bias than they actually do in their intentions/actions.
"The only reason this person is doing something nice is to get something out of me."
Google Effect
(aka Digital Amnesia)
We tend to forget information that's easily looked up in search engines.
Search
"What was the name of that actor in that funny movie? I've looked it up like eight times…
Belief Bias
We judge an argument's strength not by how strongly it supports the conclusion but how plausible the conclusion is in our own minds.
Sally mentions her supporting theory about your conspiracy theory, which you adopt wholeheartedly despite the fact that she has very little evidence for it.

THE TRIAD OF TRUST
Give more than you receive.
The principle here is about giving of yourself and searching for ways you can support someone without expecting anything in return.
Listen generously.
Listening is the hardest skill for us to master because as soon as we hear someone speak we begin to formulate a response. This also happens with all types of mobile digital communication.
GIVE
LISTEN
TRUST
RESPONSE?
BIG KNOWLEDGE SHARE
SHARE
Share your knowledge willingly.
Our knowledge is precious and worth something.
However, sharing your knowledge willingly with others builds trust. After all, you too learnt your knowledge from someone else.

THE TrUSTTRIANGLE
Anne Morriss and Frances Frei, HBR
A People end to must you when they tink they are interacting
with the real you (authenticity), when they have faith in your judgement and competence (logic), and when they believe that you care about them (empathy). When trust is lost, it can almost always be traced back to break down in one of these three drivers.

AUTHENTICITY

We store memories differently based
on how they were experienced

anthropomoronic thinas suck out more than non-bizarre/unfunny things
We notice when something has changed
Information
We discard specifics to form generalities
We edit and reinforce some memories after the fact
We are drawn to details
We favor simple-looking options and complete information over complex, ambiguous options
We notice flaws in others
• more easily than than we
notice tlaws in ourselves
To avoid mistakes,
we aim to preserve autonomy and group status, and avoid irreversible decisions
Status quo bie
We tend to find stories and patterns even when looking
at sparse data
land fallacy sod correlation
To get things done, we tend to complete things we've invested time & energy in
To stay focused, we favor the immediate, relatable thing
in front of us
Need To Act Fast
We fill in characteristics from stereotypes, generalities,
and prior histories
To act, we must be confident we can make an impact and feel what
we do is imbortant
We project our current mindset and assumptions onto the past and future
We Imadine thinas and eoole
we're familiar with or fond of

Heuristic evaluation vs. usability testing
HEURISTIC EVALUATION

USABILITY TESTING
An expert review of the interface against established usability
principles
Definition
Real users performing tasks to identify usability issues
Ul designers and product specialists (evaluators)
Participants
End-users, often matching the product's ideal user persona
Qualitative analysis based on pre-determined heuristics
Methodology
Empirical testing involving task completion and user observation
Less prone to user bias; relies on expert evaluation
Bias Consideration
Risk of data being skewed by existing users' familiarity with the product
Not applicable as it's an expert-driven process
Remote Feasibility
Highly feasible, allowing for a broader user reach and faster insights
Primarily used early in the design process for quick expert insights
Complementary Nature
Often used in conjunction with heuristic analysis for comprehensive evaluation
Un maze

Common Causes of Cognitive Bias
Emotions
If our decision involves our loved ones, as opposed to total strangers, we will evaluate the situation differently.
Motivation
Our judgments are influenced by our existing attitudes and beliefs. We are very likely to choose what is most likely to help us arrive at the conclusions we want to arrive at.
Heuristics, or mental shortcuts
Our minds use simple rules to arrive at a conclusion quickly, aiming for a
"good enough" solution quickly while minimizing mental effort.
Age
There is evidence suggesting that older people may show less cognitive flexibility.
100%
Limited information-processing capacity
Our minds have a limited ability to store and recall information, so we simply can't consider all the relevant information when we make an inference or decision.
Social influence
People have a tendency to act in socially desirable ways. This can influence collective behaviors.

PIAGET US VYGOTSKY
PIAGET
Piaget's theory focuses on the stages of cognitive development, proposing that children progress through four distinct stages. Each stage is characterized by different ways of thinking and understanding the world. This theory emphasizes the sequential and universal nature of cognitive development, with each stage building on the previous one.
VYGOTSKY
Vygotsky's theory emphasizes the fundamental role of social interaction in cognitive development, suggesting that children learn through guided interactions with more knowledgeable others. This theory uniquely highlights the importance of cultural and social context in shaping cognitive development.

Overview of Piaget & Vygotsky Ideas
Piaget's Ideas:
• Four discrete stages
• Cognitive development is limited by stages
• Young children are schematic
• Motivation to maintain cognitive equilibrium
• Development occurs when assimilation is not possible (adaptation)
• Both were constructvists
• Both believed that social forces set the limits of development
Vygotsky's ideas:
• Continuous development (no stages)
• Zone of proximal development
• Socially transmitted knowledge (cooperative learning and scaffolding)
• Private speech helps internalize knowledge

INFORMATION
SHEET
2E - UNDERSTANDING THE ASSIMILATION AND ACCOMODATION DIAGRAM
Below is a brief description of Piaget's Theory of Cognitive Development and how we accept new information into our schemas and how we interpret the world.
ASSIMILATION
Any Information you process fits comfortably with your current schemas and how you see the world
EQUILIBRIUM
You are calm and comfortable with the things you know and experience in the world that surrounds you
NEW SITUATION
You encounter a new piece of information or a new experience that you have no internal programme that it fits easily
DISEQUILIBRIUM
Thinking about this new information creates discomfort and cognitive dissonance as two or more schemas conflict
ACCOMODATION
In order for the new information to be accepted, your old schema that is conflicting with it needs to be changed.

ASSIMILATION US ACCOMMODATION
ASSIMILATION
Definition
Improving existing knowledge of something thanks to new but congruent information.
Example
A child owns a poodle. They see a dachshund and notice it looks like a poodle.
They point at the dachshund and say "That's a dog!" The parent says "Yes. It's a dog called a dachshund." The child's 'dog' schema is now improved and refined - they now know two types of dogs.
ACCOMMODATION
Definition
Amending existing knowledge of something thanks to new information that contradicts previous thinking.
Example
A child owns a poodle. They see a cat and notice it looks like a poodle. They point at the cat and say "That's a dog!" The parent corrects them: "that's a cat". The child now has to change its 'dog' schema to exclude some tour-legged pets, and instead create a new
'cat' schema.

Piaget's Theory
- Cognitive approach
Assessed children by telling them hypothetical stories
Children
make a comparison of
the bet
???? & suggest who ought
to get the greatest punishment
5-9yrs - assessed the behaviour on the damage done rather than whether they had intended to be bad or not
10+ judgement was dependant
on motive for act
Morality - rule governed
10yrs+ Rules change on participants agreeing
AUTONOMOUS
subject to one's own laws/rules
mutual respect
4 Moral relativism
realise that rules come from social relationships, importance of other's opinions.
5-9yrs Rules are from authority over us HETERONOMOUS
subject to another's rules/laws
Moral realism +
unilateral respect
elements of morality, rules; punishments come from external authority All things right/wrong as they've been told is the case.
Change from heteronous - autonomous morality
egocentric - operational thought = decline in egocentrism (Age 7)
Unilateral respect - mutual respect = compromise in peer groups

Definition
This refers to the process of incorporating new information or experiences into existing cognitive structures or mental frameworks.
this involves modifying existing cognitive structures or creating new ones in response to new
information on experiences:
Process
In assimilation, individuals Interpret new experiences by fitting them into their existing schemas without necessarily changing those schemas. They may use their existing knowledge to make sense of new information,
Accommodation involves altering existing schemas or creating new ones to accommodate new information that cannot be easily assimilated. This leads to a restructuring of cognitive frameworks.
Outcome
The outcome of assimilation is the Accommodation leads to reinforcement and reinforcement

Piaget's Theory of Cognitive Development
Piaget believed that children acquire knowledge based on their experiences in order to achieve continuous understanding within themselves. Children will integrate new information from new experiences with information from previous experiences forthem to understand new concepts and adjust their expectations to enter the new information into their cognitive development. Moreover, he declared that children's thinking grows in sequence of stages. After reaching a certain stage, the child will not retum to the previous stage.
Sensorimotor Intelligence
Birth to Age 2)
Babies build understanding through their senses such as seeing, feeling,
nearing and touche
Children who reach the age about 6 months and above, they begin to organize ideas into firm concepts that do not change
undren who are attre end or unis sensorimotor stage, they have an understanding of object permanence For example, babies initially do not understand about a particular object, but when they look and feel it constantly, they will begin to understand the object and be able to store information about the object into their minds.
At this stage, children learn something through repetitive actions but not through language because they stil cannot speak well
Preoperational Thinking
(Ages 2 to 7)
› At this stage children have a high power of imagination and fantasy in their minds.
> This happen because children they still cannot really understand about the reality of the world.
> Children are very confident with the things that they know, even though they are less aware of logical thinking
They continue to build understanding through dramatic ways
Implications in teaching and learning
Children at this stage should be encouraged to develop their creativity
Antonimmonative evileen
drawing, listening to music and fiction storytelling. While engaged in imaginative play, children are simultaneously reflecting on the realistic experience.
Concrete Operational Thinking
(Ages 7 to 11)
Children begin to think logically and more flexible with their thoughts and ideas which leads them to solve problems in a more systematic way
Children are able to make logical reasoning but they are still tied to concrete objects or events
Two things that discriminate concrete operational thinking in this stage:
Reversibility = Allow child to manipulate
the order of any process
Decentering = Allow child to step back
and analyse an issue from more than one angle
Children being able to consider the problem from another perspective
Children make more deliberate and calculated choices, which illustrate that they are aware of their decentering.
Teachers need to provide concrete materials while teaching in order to challenge students to think logically and analyoda. leachers nood to plan teaching activities that can challenge students
akinat era mam memaden Terancina
knowledge. Teacher needs to show the sotution accordine to simple and systematic steps
Formal Operational Thinking
(Age 11 on)
They are not only able to think about the reality of the world but they are also able to reason abstractly and idealistically.
> They are able to solve problems in a more organized and systematic way with a combination of knowledge, skills and experience
> Teens have the ability to form hypotheses and able to take up the challenge to get the validity of the information
Teens do not need much help from others to help them in solving problem because they are more likely to be independent and need less instruction from their teacher
Implications in teaching and learning
Teachats can use concrate materials to illustrate more complex concepts such as the use 0130 materials. models, charts and diagrams as the beginning of more complex teaching. Teachers must give students the opportunty to solve tne prote and direct them to show cause to put forward solutions.
Piaget's theory of cognitive development helps augment our understanding of children's intellectual growth. It also emphasizes that children are not just passive recipients of knowledge. Instead, children are constantly investigating and experimenting as they build their understanding of how the world works.
Chomsky's Theory of Language Development
Noam Chomsky declared that humans may be born with a natural skill that allows them to detect characteristics and rules in the using of language. Each individual has been genetically programmed with universal grammar which is a basic understanding of how communication is structured.
LANGUAGES SHARE CERTAIN
BASIC TRAITS
* Chomsky emphasizes that all languages contain similar structures and rules despite their other variations
Al languages have similar elements, for example adjectives, nouns and verbs
All language use structures that repeat themselves, for example,
"She wore an itsy-bitsy, teeny-weeny, yellow poka dot dress."
+ The richness of recursive lanquage allows humans to expand sentences by placing repeating structures inside each other, for example, "She believed Ricky was innocent' almost endlessly: "Lucy believed that Fred and Ethel knew Ricky had insisted he was innocent."
The reason Chomsky declared that Universal
Grammar is exist
WE LEARN LANGUAGE MOST
EFFORTESSLY
Children develop language in a very similar way and in a short period of time without much effort because they are generally already exposed to language formation since they are born
→ Children will observe and match sentence structure with the language used in their environment
Children have a natural understanding of how words work even if they themselves do not know the words, this may be happen because they have heard people around them use the language
WE LEARN DESPITE A "POVERTY
OF STIMULUS"
• Humans leam complex languages with complicated rules and grammar without receiving explicit instructions
* Humans in tend to increase their mastery of complex language developments
+ Children automatically
understand the correct way to arrange sentence structure without being taught
WE LEARN IN THE SAME
SEQUENCE
* Children naturally develop language in the same sequence of steps
* Although each child goes through this stage at a different rate, but they are all going through the same sequence of language development
Children's specific language development stage:
1. Infant absorb and produce speech sounds
2. Infant babble with a consonant-then-vowel pattern
3. Children begin to speak first basic words
Children develop vocabulary over time and learn to classify things
4. Children build two-word sentences and then increase the complexity of their sentences
Implications of teaching and learning
Since young children are primed for natural language acquisition, so learning a second language may be more effective in early childhood. Teachers should encourage students to learn many languages. This can be done by pronouncing words in various languages so that they become accustomed to the words they always hear.

WRONG ETHICS
RIGHT
Deception: Participants should not be deceived unless absolutely
Informed consent: Participants should always give informed consert. This may not be possible if participants are being deceived
Debriefing: Partkipants should be infored of the true nature and purpose of the research at the end of the study
Confidentiality: Participants must be kept anonymous and should not be identifable from any research reports
Independent variable (IV) is the variable that is manipulsted by the experimenter
Dependent variable (OV) is the variable that is measured to see if it has been affected by the TV.
Extraneous (confounding) variables are any uncontrolied variables that might infiuence the findings and affect the refiability and validity of the results.
Ecological validity is the degree to which behaviours observed in a. study represent real life.

RESEARCH METHODS & DATA COLLECTION
Sociologists use a range of research methods to conduct their research, but they are often linked to specific methodologies
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
POSITIVISH
INTERPRETIVISH
FEMINISM
BRIEF OVERVIEW
This methodology adopts a scientific approach to research in order to identify trends and patterns in human behaviour. Positivists aim to prove of falsay a hypotiesis by generating quantitative data that is objective and high in reliabilty.
Interpretivists seek to explain how study subjects feel and act by trying to empathise with them. This is known as Verstehen and can be achieved by generating in-depth qualitate data that is high in validity and rich in detail.
Unsurprisingly, this approach is grounded in fominist theory, which seeks to combat malestream sociology It aims to bring about social change and, like interpretivism, it
WHAT RESEARCH METHODS DO THEY FAVOUR?
• Surveys and questionnaires
• Structured interviews
• Unstructured interviews
Covert observations
• Mostly qualitative but someumes qualitative
QUESTIONNAIRES
Questionnaires are designed for self-completion and can be administered in different ways, such as face-to-face or by email or post.
Strengths
Because of standardisation, questionnaires have fairly high reliability.
Low-cost and not time consuming
Weaknesses
X Questions can be misinterpreted, which lowers the validity of the responses.
X Response rates may be low unless respondents have an incentive to participate
CONTENT ANALYSIS
When using this method, researchers count or measure the frequency of something to quantity an aspect of the media.
STRENGTHS
Retatively cheap and usetul for studying mass media
•Cin uncover the meaning of a text
WEAKNESSES
Hugely retant on the coding of texts when categories are produced to be analysed
OBSERVATIONS
Goss vadons dour in amerent toms deberling of how much researchers wants to immerse themselves in the group being studied. Participants are observed, and the observer records the actions.
The researcher joins the group being studied, and the participants are aware that they are being observed.
Strengths
• Enables the observer to ask questions
• Has high ecological validity as subjects are studied in their natural enronment
Weaknesses
• Potential for participants to change their behaviour if they know they are being watched (le. Hawthore Eltect
• Difficult to record the data: creates potential ethical issuos
Participant Observation: Covert
The researcher joins the group being studied, but the participants. are not aware that they are being observed.
Strengths
• Has high validity, which should reduce the Hawthorne Effect.
«Allows access to groups that would refuse to participate
Weaknesses
•May be considered unethical to deceive the participants
Lost objectivity (eg. The
INTERVIEWS
These are generally administered face-to-face.
STRUCTURED INTERVIEW
This is a questionnaire admiristered by the researcher
-Standardised set of questions given to alt respondents in the same order
"High response rate because of the
Weaknesses
« Potential for intervtewer blas (eg from tone of voice)
• Can be time- consuming
UNSTRUCTURED INTERYIEW
Unstructured interviews are in-depth and not standardised.
Questions can be generated based on interviewees responses
Strengths
• Very Bexible because additional questions can be asked
• A rapport can be developed with the interviewee by using an
Weaknesses
•Very time-consoming to do and analyse
« Interviewer effect: whery response validity is undermined by the Interviewer'S social characteristics
ETHNOGRAPHIC APPROACH
This approach is used to study a particular way of life (e.g. subcultures). It often uses a combination of participant observations and unstructured interviews to gather an in-depth account of a social group.
Strengths
• Can provide a holstic understanding of the group (eg why they behave the way they do)
• Excellent for achieving empathy/Vestehen
Weaknesses
• Very difficult to repeat the research, making it not particularly retable
• May cteate ethical issues due to a lack of consensual access to the group
ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Sociological research is governed by standards (set by the British Sociological Association in the UK) to ensure that research is performed in an
1. Informed consent: in most research, participants should give their consent to take part in the study, but in some cases deception may have to be used (covert participant observation).
2. Debrtefing: Participants should be made aware of the nature and purpose of the research at the end of the study.
3. Confidentiality and anonymity: Participants should not have to disclose their names, sno the ivormaton that they give dunne the sooy shoud notoe traceable back to them.

Publication
SCIENTIFIC contains peer-reviewed articles by
JOURNAL qualified contributors
primary audience: scientists, psychology students
peer-review process: experts determine the quality of the work/research
→ flawed research does not get published ideally)
→ continues after publication (letters, commentaries, competing studies,...)
PUBLICATION MAKES PROCESS OF RESEARCH TRANSPARENT
written by journalists, easily accessed & understood
JIKNAISY
audience: general public
general public can benefit by learning about the work of psychologists
HOWEVER: journalists tend to go for the sensational story, rather than the important one - summarising research:
"dumbing down" - misleading headlines for dramatic purposes - reported scientific
research might get distorted
How to not be misled?
skeptical mindset, find the original source

Experimenta
Aim ~ a general expression of what the researcher intends to investigate. Eg, To investigate whether drinking energy drinks makes people more talkative.
Hypothesis ~ a statement of what the researcher believes to be true of the relationship between the independent and dependent variables
Directional hypothesis - predicts which if the two conditions will result in a greater change in the dependent variable Eg, There will be significantly more cones knocked over by those who have drunk 3 pints of beer compared to those who have not.
Non-directional hypothesis - the experimenter thinks the independent variable will affect the dependent variable but not sure in what direction Eg, There will be a significant difference in the number of cones knocked over between those who have drunk 3 pints of beer and those who have not.
-Null hypothesis - contradicts the experimental hypothesis.
Eg, There will be no significant difference in the number of cones knocked over by people who have drunk 3 pints of beer than those who haven't. Any results are due to chance.
- The independent variable is the variable that the experimenter manipulates, and the dependent variable is the variable that the experimenter measures
Operationalisation ~ clearly defining variable in terms of how they can be measured Eg, table
I - alcohol or no alcohol
V - whether
participants receive 50ml of alcohol or no alcohol
OV - memory
DV — result in a memory test

Control of Variables/ Research Issues:
Extraneous variables ~ Any variable other than the independent variable that may affect the dependent variable if it is not controlled eg, time of day, order effects, investigator effects, age, gender
Confounding variables ~ any variable other than the independent variable that affects the dependent variable so we cannot be sure of the true source of changes to the dependent variable eg, years of driving experience
Demand characteristics ~ any cue from the researcher or from the research situation that may be interpreted by the participants as revealing the purpose of the investigation This may lead to the participant changing their behaviour within the research situation
- This can be reduced by using different participants in each condition, so they are less likely to realise the aims of the study
- Single blind experiment where the participant doesn't know which side of the experiment they are assigned to

RESEARCH METHODS

...DIFFERENT TO RESEARCH DESIGN!

• Where a researcher manipulates the
LAB
independent variable (IV) to see its effect on the dependent variable (DV).
EXPERIMENT
• Happens in a CONTROLLED environment e.g. lab.
• IV/DV used to find cause/effect

FIELD
• Where a researcher manipulates the independent variable (IV) to see its effect on the dependent variable (V).
EXPERIMENT
• Happens in a NATURAL environment e.g. lab.
• IV/DV used to find cause/effect

NATURAL
• The independent variable (IV) occurs naturally and is not manipulated e.g. male v female.
EXPERIMENT
• Dependent variables are still measured to determine differences between groups
e.g. IV - male/female
DV - Maths test score

• Measures the strength of a relationship between two variable e.g. stress and illness
CORRELATION
• Does NOT determine cause/ effect because it has no IV/DV.

• The measurement and systematic recording of behaviour-either in the field or in the lab.
OBSERVATION
• They usually involve the use of behavioural categories - specific behaviours are chosen to be counted or timed during the observation.

• Where the participant gives information about
SELF REPORT
themselves to the researcher.
• This can be through a questionnaire (written) or an interview (face to face).

• An in-depth, detailed study of one individual or small group.
CASE STUDY
• Data is gathered in lots of different ways: Inter-views, biographies, observations, tests etc.
• Often used in rare and unique cases e.g. Genie

THE PLACEBO EFFECT
Do patients find expensive placebos more effective than cheap placebos?
PURPOSE OF THE EXPERIMENT
In what ways can fictitious costs impact the effectiveness of a placebo? To better understand how the 'placebo effect' takes place, we will provide placebos of different reported costs and measure their impact on the patients.
HYPOTHESIS
Providing placebos that are 'expensive' will amplify the placebo effect of actual placebos in patients.
METHOD
Participants
Participants suffering from Parkinson's
Disease serve as placebo effect test subjects
Method
Each participant receives an effective drug valued at $100 per dose and then motor function changes are measured. After each participant receives an effective drug said to be valued at $1500 per dose, then their motor functions are measured again.
CONCLUSION
While the degree of improvement in motor function for participants varied due to the administration of a $1500 placebo drug, all participants experienced improved motor functions. A higher cost for a placebo will improve patients' conditions even more.

6 TYPES OF QUALITATIVE
RESEARCH
What is qualitative research?
Qualitative research is in-depth research designed to reveal target customers behavior, feelings, thinks and etc.
Benefits of the qualitative research for marketing and business:
- Understand your customer's meanings, opinions, underlying reasons, and motivations.
- Catch the language that customers use to describe a product.
- Generate ideas for improving your products.
- Generate directions for improving the communications with your customers.
- Understand how people perceive your marketing messages.
- Develop hypotheses for further testing with qualitative methods.
TYPES OF QUALITATIVE RESEARCH:
In-depth interview
Focus groups
One of the most common types of qualitative research methods. It involves a personal interview with a single respondent.
Provides a great opportunity to capture rich, descriptive data about people's behaviors, motivations, beliefs and etc.
A focus group includes a small number of participants (around 6 to 12 from within your target market.
This method collects data through a group interaction. A researcher leads a discussion amongst the group where the participants share lifestyle, needs and etc.
Ethnographic research
This is probably the most in-depth observational method that studies people in their naturally occurring environment.
The researchers immerse themselves in the participants environment, which may be anywhere from an organization to a
geographical location. The purpose is to gain a detailed description of everyday life.
Action Research
This is a method in which the researcher and recipients belong to a same group or community.
Action research is conducted by individuals working with others as part of a "community of practice" and this method aims to solve a particular problem.
Content analysis
Includes interpreting words and images from a variety of documents, music, or other types of media.
Aims to find out how the words/images are used, and in what context. Allows you to draw conclusions about a hidden culture or behavior.
Case study
A case study is an in-depth research of a particular situation or event. The method is based on real-world experiences.
It is used within many disciplines including education, social sciences, business, law, health.

The National Centre for Neurology and Brain Mechanics presents:
Cognitive Dissonance:
Performing Menial Tasks
Festinger, Carlsmith and Chessman wanted to understand if making people perform a menial task would result in cognitive dissonance as a result of forced compliance behavior.
Hypothesis
When asked to do an unenjoyable task, people will not readily admit as much, and tell themselves and others it is actually enjoyable.
71 male students were selected as participants to perform a series of menial tasks (like turning pegs in
a peg board for an hour).
The participants were then paid either $1 or $20 to tell a waiting participant (a confederate) that the tasks were really engaging and fun. Almost all of the participants agreed to walk into the waiting room and persuade the confederate that the boring experiment
would be interesting.
Method
Results
When the participants were asked to evaluate the experiment, the participants who were paid only $1
rated the tedious task as more fun and enjoyable than the participants who were paid $20 to lie.
Getting paid $1 is not sufficient for lying, so those who were paid $1 experienced dissonance. These participants could only overcome that dissonance by coming to believe that the tasks were interesting
and enjoyable.
Being paid $20 provides a reason for turning pegs,
and therefore resulted in no dissonance.

+
Hypothesis:
When asked to do an unenjovable task, people will not readily admit as much, and tell themselves and others it is actually enjoyable.
Method:
The participants were then paid either $1 or $20
to tell a waiting participant (a test confederate) that the tasks were really engaging and fun. Almost all of the participants agreed to walk into the waiting room and persuade the confederate that the boring experiment would be interesting.
Conclusion:
Getting paid $1 is not sufficient for lying, so those who were paid $1 experienced dissonance.
These participants could only overcome that dissonance by coming to believe that the tasks really were interesting and enjoyable.
Being paid $20 provides a reason, therefore there is no dissonance.

Acquisition
Learning through acquisition is what learners are doing when they are listening to a lecture or podcast, reading from books or websites, and watching demos or videos.
Production
Learning through
production is the way the teacher motivates the learner to consolidate what they have learned by articulating their current conceptual understanding and how they used it in practice.
Discussion
Learning through discussion requires the learner to articulate their ideas and questions, and to challenge and respond to the ideas and questions from the teacher and/or their peers.
Collaboration
Learning through collaboration embraces mainly discussion, practice and production.
Building on investigations and acquisition, it is about taking part in the process of knowledge building itself.
Practice
Learning through practice enables the learner to adapt their actions to the task goal by using feedback to improve. This may come from self-reflection, peers, their teacher, or from the activity itself.
Investigation
Learning through investigation guides the learner to explore, compare and critique the texts, documents and resources that reflect the concepts and ideas being taught.

Types of Learning
Classical conditioning:
learning to link two stimuli in a way that helps us anticipate an event to which we have a reaction
Cognitive learning:
acquiring new behaviors and information through observation and information, rather than by direct experience
Operant conditioning:
changing behavior choices in response to consequences

OBSERUATIONAL LEARNING
Observational learning is learning by watching the actions of others. A specific behavior is observed by a student, trainee, or child, and then that behavior is imitated.
KEY FACTORS
1. Attention: Observers cannot learn if they are not actually paying attention.
2. Retention: The observation must be placed in memory.
3. Reproduction: The observer has the ability to reproduce the observed behavior.
4. Motivation: Without motivation to engage in the behavior, it will not be reproduced.
EXAMPLE
Apprenticeships
Apprenticeships are a perfect example of observational learning. Through an apprenticeship, you can actually watch what the professional is doing rather than simply learning about it in a classroom.
Apprenticeships are therefore very common in practical and hands-on professions like plumbing, carpentry, and cooking.

OPERANT CONDITIONING
Operant conditioning explains how people and animals develop learned responses through the repetition of reinforcements and punishments.
KEY CONCEPTS
Positive reinforcement - when something pleasant or rewarding is given after a specific behavior.
Negative reinforcement - an attempt to increase a specific behavior by removing something that is negative when the behavior is done.
Punishment - applying something aversive after a specific behavior to decrease the frequency of that behavior.
EXAMPLE IN EDUCATION
Kindergarten teachers utilize the principles of operant conditioning on a daily basis.
When a child is well-behaved, the teacher might put a gold star or smiley face sticker by their name on a poster.
The teacher has just used positive reinforcement to reward a behavior they want to see more of. Rewarding behavior increases the chance of it recurring.

CLASSICAL US OPERANT
CONDITIONING
CLASSICAL
Classical conditioning is a form of learning where a neutral stimulus becomes associated with a naturally occurring stimulus, leading to the neutral stimulus eliciting a response. It involves the process of pairing two stimuli to create a learned association. It was founded by Ivan Pavlov via his famous Pavlov's dog experiment.
OPERANT
Operant conditioning is a type of learning where behaviors are strengthened or weakened based on the consequences that follow them. It focuses on how the consequences of actions influence the likelihood of those actions being repeated in the future. It was founded by B.F Skinner via his famous Skinner box experiment.

COMPARISON OF CLASSICAL AND OPERANT CONDITIONING

Classical Conditioning
Operant Conditioning
Response
Involuntary, automatic.
Voluntary, operates on environment.
Acquisition
Associating events; CS announces US.
Associating response with a consequence (reinforcer or punisher).
Extinction
CR decreases when CS is repeatedly presented alone.
Responding decreases when reinforcement stops.
Cognitive processes
Organisms develop expectation that
CS signals the arrival of US.
Organisms develop expectation that a response will be reinforced or punished; they also exhibit latent learning, without reinforcement.
Biological predispositions
Natural predispositions constrain what stimuli and responses can easily be associated.
Organisms best learn behaviors similar to their natural behaviors; unnatural behaviors instinctively drift back toward natural ones.

Classical Vs. Operant Conditioning: What Is the Difference?
Classical Vs. Operant Conditioning
Classical conditioning and operant conditioning are key terms in behavioral psychology. In classical conditioning, involuntary responses occur to a specific stimulus. For example, dogs salivate after a tone because food is being served. In operant conditioning, reinforcement or punishment shapes voluntary behavior. For example, someone praises their child for doing their homework, reinforcing them to continue doing it.

Self-Control
People control their own behavior to the extent that they rely on cognitive supports and manage relevant environmental cues and consequences.
Symbolic Processes
Symbolic verbal or mental representations of reality help guide behavior.
Vicarious Learning
Most complex behavior is acquired by directly observing and initiating others in a social environment.

VICARIOUS CONDITIONING
Vicarious conditioning refers to learning through observing other people's responses to an environmental stimulus. Observers imitate successful models.
EXAMPLE
BENEFIT
A vicarious conditioning example is when a child sees another child get rewarded for sharing their toys,
meading the child to engage in sharing behavior themselves.
In vicarious conditioning, an individual does not have to experience the consequences of a behavior directly to learn from it.
Instead, they can observe the consequences that others receive and use this information to guide their behavior.

COGNITIVE SCHEMA
A cognitive schema is a cognitive framework that organizes information about the world around us. It is a packet of information in our brain that categorizes objects and concepts into groups.
EXPLANATION
Our brains like to group things based on common features. We call this a schema.
Having schema in our mind makes it easier for us to identify new objects and try to define them based on our existing knowledge of similar objects and concepts.
For example, you might see a raspberry and know it's a berry due to its similarities to strawberries and mulberries. Here, you're using your berry schema.
EXAMPLES
• Object Schema: Learning the difference between car and bus.
2 Role schema: Learned gender roles
3 Event Schema: Differentiating
between seasons
4 Self-Schema: Learning about personal aptitudes
5 Person Schema: Learning about other people's personalities, roles, and preferences

Kep Concepts in Behavioural
Learning Theory
Stimulus Control
Cues that cause specific responses or behaviours. Central to classical conditioning.
Neutral stimuli have no effect until paired with an outcome.
Generalisation is when people respond to similar cues.
Discrimination is when people only respond to very specific cues.
Behaviour Modification
Shaping behaviour through rewards & consequences.
Central to operant conditioning.
Reinforcement is encouraging behaviours, making them more likely to be repeated.
Punishment is discouraging behaviours, making them less likely to be repeated.
Extinction is behaviour stopping when rewards & consequences do.

Mathematics of Imaging:
Seeing by Solving
SEEING SMALL
Researchers can make three-dimensional images of proteins smaller than a nanometer, thanks to a technique called cryogenic electron microscopy.
In this process, mathematics is used to reduce noise and create an interpretable image from the data.
Electron beams
We often depend on images to make sense of our surroundings, be it through explorations of complex molecules that underpin scientific advances, examinations of structures inside the human body to help treat illnesses, or glimpses into the outer reaches of our universe. However, most images begin as a collection of data and must be converted to something that can be interpreted by the human eye. Mathematical and statistical techniques make this possible.
DATA COLLECTION
IMAGE RECONSTRUCTION
Electron beams
2D projection detail
First, a large sample of identical molecules is flash frozen and an array of electron beams is directed through the sample.
The electron beams generate two-dimen-sional projections of a molecule.
In order to construct a three-dimensional image of the molecule, researchers need to solve a problem known as
"angular reconstruction."
FINAL IMAGES
These projections are tiny and hard to distinguish from noise, requiring specialized mathematical processing techniques. The Fourier transform aids in approximating the solution.
2D projection
SEEING WITHIN
Doctors can view bones and organs in the body through computed tomography, often referred to as a CT scan.
These scans use mathematical tools, such as the Radon transform and filtered back projection, to piece together X rays taken from many angles and create a coherent image of the body part being scanned.
Head
In a CT scan, X rays are passed through the body from many different angles toward a set of detectors that measure the intensity of the rays.
The data are captured as a series of contours.
This collection is called a Radon transform.
Each contour provides a glimpse into what the scanned part looks like from a different angle.
But the views are often incomplete or unclear.
Filtered back projection-one approach for solving this inverse problem
-involves filtering and distributing the contours into an image.
Contour
SEEING BEYOND
With the Event Horizon
Telescope, scientists recently captured the first image of a black hole, approximately 55 million light-years away from Earth.
This monumental discovery was enabled by mathematical tools, including the Fourier transform, imaging algorithms, and optimization.
NATIONAL ACADEMIES

Medicine
Frequency measurements
RING
CRESCENT
To visualize the black hole, each pair of
• telescopes collects a frequency data point of the incoming radiation, measured relative to their positions.
The time delays at these different locations are exploited to correct noise in these signals.
Earth's rotation allows scientists to capture
more messure-ment
from this small number of telescopes.
The data are sparse and noisy, and many possible images might fit this data.
Researchers use mathematical imaging algorithms to produce images from the
incomplete information about the frequency measurements.
Machine learning and optimization techniques are involved in producing and validating the image that best fits the data.

CHOOSING therapy
How a Brain Scan for Mental Illness Diagnosis Is Used
Can Brain Scans
Diagnose Mental Illness?
While brain scans can be a helpful tool for doctors to identify and rule out physical conditions that might be causing mental health symptoms, they are not currently reliable enough to diagnose mental illness on their own. There is undoubtedly movement towards using neuroimaging tools to diagnose and predict treatment outcomes for mental illness.
