The section being addressed is **10.1 The Basics of Motivation**.

### Learning Objective 10.1.1: Explain the role played by needs, drives, responses, goals, and incentives in shaping our motives

#### 🎯 Slide 1: LO 10.1.1: Motivation’s Anatomy

- Use this format: # LO 10.1.1: The Motivational Chain Reaction
- Give 1–2 sentence plain-language definition: Motivation refers to the dynamics of behavior—the way our actions are aroused, maintained, and guided. Our actions generally follow a chain: an internal deficiency creates tension (Need $\rightarrow$ Drive), which causes an action (Response) aimed at a target (Goal).
- Add 2–3 key bullets highlighting distinctions:
- Needs are _internal deficiencies_ (like a shortage of nutrients), while Drives are the resulting _bodily tension_ (like hunger).
- Motivated behavior is energized by both the internal **“push”** of drives and the external **“pull”** of incentives (rewards or desirable stimuli).
- A strong need can make a low-incentive item (like horrible leftovers) a desired goal.

🗒 Presenter Notes (required):

- **Clarify:** A common confusion is that needs and drives are the same. They are not; the strength of a drive can be different from the underlying need (e.g., older people can suffer from dehydration—a need—without feeling thirsty—a drive).
- **Ask:** Can you think of a recent instance where you pursued a goal based purely on a powerful incentive, even though you had no internal need for it? (Think dessert after a big meal.)
- **Reminder:** I’ll tell the story of Li Na, the biology student, who was first driven by true hunger, and later by “pie lust”.

#### 🎯 Slide 2: What It Looks Like in Real Life

- Title: “What it looks like in real life”
- Start with a ✅ hook: ✅ Sometimes motivation is logical, like solving a problem; other times, it’s just about that delicious pie.
- Give 2–3 vivid, funny, or surprising examples:
- **The Textbook Case:** Li Na stops concentrating on her biology studying (response) because she has a physical shortage of key nutrients (need), which creates the painful tension of hunger (drive). She then seeks a fast-food outlet (goal).
- **The Incentive Override:** After eating a massive Thanksgiving dinner and complaining she is "too full to move," Li Na suddenly eats three large pieces of her aunt's pie because pie is a highly desirable external incentive, overriding her satisfied internal needs.
- **The Low-Incentive Challenge:** Roasted grasshoppers are nutritious and could meet a biological need. However, they are usually rejected as a goal because of their low incentive value—unless you’re on a reality show and truly starving.
- End with an optional > quote or punchline:

Whether you’re eating leftovers from the back of the fridge or three pieces of cheesecake, you’re just trying to balance the push of necessity with the pull of desire.

🗒 Presenter Notes:

- **Clarify why the examples fit:** The Li Na examples perfectly demonstrate how motivation can follow the simple Need $\rightarrow$ Drive $\rightarrow$ Response $\rightarrow$ Goal model, but the pie example shows how a powerful external **incentive** can energize behavior even when the biological **need** (hunger) is reduced.
- **Ask for student examples:** Ask the audience to share an example of a time they ate something strictly because it was a high incentive, not because they were hungry.
- **Reminder of which example lands best:** The pie lust example works best because everyone can relate to eating dessert after feeling "full".

### Learning Objective 10.1.2: Distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation

#### 🎯 Slide 1: LO 10.1.2: Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motives

- Use this format: # LO 10.1.2: Motivated by Self or Swag?
- Give 1–2 sentence plain-language definition: Intrinsic motivation is acting based on internal satisfaction, pleasure, or the desire to actualize potential. Extrinsic motivation, conversely, comes from outside the person, driven by external rewards, obligations, or approval (like pay or grades).
- Add 2–3 key bullets highlighting distinctions:
- **Intrinsic Motivation** is often tied to creativity and problem-solving because the individual feels free and personally invested.
- **Extrinsic Motivation** often defines “work” activities (like being paid to cook), while intrinsic motivation defines activities done for inherent enjoyment (like cooking as a hobby).
- While salaries can increase the _amount_ of work done, challenging, intrinsically rewarding work is often just as important as money.

🗒 Presenter Notes (required):

- **Clarify:** It’s counter-intuitive, but giving excessive external rewards for an activity someone already enjoys can decrease their intrinsic interest. Psychology calls this turning "play" into "work".
- **Ask:** If you could choose a job that paid slightly less but was intrinsically fulfilling, or a highly paid but boring job, which would you pick and why?
- **Reminder:** I’ll mention the story about children who stopped drawing after being rewarded, demonstrating how rewards can backfire.

#### 🎯 Slide 2: What It Looks Like in Real Life

- Title: “What it looks like in real life”
- Start with a ✅ hook: ✅ Why does James Cameron bother building remote vehicles to explore the ocean after directing _Avatar_?
- Give 2–3 vivid, funny, or surprising examples:
- **The Inventor Director (Intrinsic):** James Cameron, director of blockbusters like _Titanic_ and _Avatar_, also codeveloped digital 3D cameras and remote ocean vehicles, showing a drive to explore creative solutions and actualize potential, regardless of external payment.
- **The Coerced Teen (Extrinsic Failure):** Teenagers who reject school and learning often feel as if they are being "coerced or bribed to act," leading them to lack initiative because the motivation feels entirely external (grades, approval).
- **The Piano Failure:** A mom praises and rewards her preschool son with candy for banging on the piano. Soon, the naturally enjoyable activity (intrinsic) becomes associated with the external reward, and the boy loses interest entirely when the reward stops.
- End with an optional > quote or punchline:

“When extrinsic motivation is stressed, people are less likely to solve tricky problems and come up with innovative ideas”.

🗒 Presenter Notes:

- **Clarify why the examples fit:** Cameron and the unrewarded creativity illustrate intrinsic drive (mastery, learning). The teenager and piano examples highlight the risk that extrinsic rewards can undermine spontaneous interest.
- **Ask for student examples:** Ask students: When are you most creative—when you’re graded on it, or when you’re doing it purely for fun?
- **Reminder of which example lands best:** The example of "play being turned into work" by lavish rewards (the piano/drawing story) is a classic finding that usually surprises students.

#### 🎯 Slide 3: What It’s NOT

- Title: “What it’s NOT”
- Use 🚫 bullets with brief explanations:
- 🚫 **Extrinsic motivation is not always bad and should not always be avoided.** If an activity has no intrinsic interest to begin with, or if basic skills are lacking, extrinsic rewards may be necessary to focus attention until real interest develops.
- 🚫 **It’s not only a young person’s priority.** Large-scale studies show that finding value and intrinsic reward in a career path is important at _any_ age.

🗒 Presenter Notes:

- **Clarify what students often get wrong:** Students often assume that since intrinsic motivation produces higher quality work, we should _never_ use extrinsic rewards. Clarify that extrinsic rewards are useful as a temporary tool to focus attention or when the task is inherently boring.
- **Ask a correction or contrast question:** Should a manager _always_ pay employees for coming up with new ideas? (Answer: Money can help, but quality is better affected by intrinsic factors like personal interest and freedom of choice).
- **Reminder:** Mnemonic or framing tip: If you use extrinsic rewards for enjoyable tasks, think of the formula: **Small and Quick $\rightarrow$ Extrinsic Rewards**.

### Learning Objective 10.1.3: Distinguish between Maslow’s basic needs and growth needs

#### 🎯 Slide 1: LO 10.1.3: Maslow’s Basic Needs vs. Growth Needs

- Use this format: # LO 10.1.3: Maslow: Survival First, Self-Actualization Later
- Give 1–2 sentence plain-language definition: Abraham Maslow proposed a hierarchy where needs are categorized as either basic needs (focused on survival and security) or growth needs (focused on self-actualization and fulfilling potential). Basic needs are considered prepotent (dominant), meaning they must generally be met before pursuing growth needs.
- Add 2–3 key bullets highlighting distinctions:
- **Basic Needs** (deficiency motives) include physiological survival, safety, love/belonging, and esteem/self-esteem; they are activated by a _lack_.
- **Growth Needs** (self-actualization) are positive, life-enhancing forces for personal growth and are _not_ based on deficiencies.
- Maslow recognized that the dominance of basic needs is _not absolute_, and culture or circumstances can lead needs to emerge in a different order.

🗒 Presenter Notes (required):

- **Clarify:** While the hierarchy is often drawn as a pyramid showing basic needs at the bottom and growth needs at the top, Maslow did not create this famous visual; it was developed later when his work was applied to business management.
- **Ask:** If someone is currently struggling to pay their rent, which type of need is dominating their motivation, and why?
- **Reminder:** I’ll briefly mention the story of Halima Aden, who is motivated not just to be a great model but a great role model (a growth need).

#### 🎯 Slide 2: What It Looks Like in Real Life

- Title: “What it looks like in real life”
- Start with a ✅ hook: ✅ How can you tell if someone is truly living their best life, or just trying to keep the lights on?
- Give 2–3 vivid, funny, or surprising examples:
- **Prioritizing Survival:** When a person is starving (physiological needs unmet) or feeling threatened (safety needs unmet), they will have little interest in higher-level growth needs, like talking with friends or writing poetry.
- **The College Trade-Off:** Students who are primarily concerned with meeting basic needs (like money, personal appearance, and social recognition) tend to score lower than average on measures of growth needs (like vitality and general well-being).
- **The Great Override (Non-Conformity):** A person who engages in humanitarian work in a dangerous war zone is prioritizing growth needs (personal fulfillment/meaning) while deliberately putting basic safety needs at risk.
- End with an optional > quote or punchline:

The hierarchy means you often focus on the basics until the roof stops leaking, then you can worry about the soul-searching.

🗒 Presenter Notes:

- **Clarify why the examples fit:** The starving person shows the general rule that basic needs are dominant. The humanitarian worker shows the exception, where personal values (growth) can override the need for safety.
- **Ask for student examples:** Ask students where they see Maslow’s hierarchy playing out in media or politics (e.g., global conflicts, economic disparities).
- **Reminder of which example lands best:** Use the image of the wheelchair athletes competing—Maslow considered that level of vigorous competition an expression of the need for self-actualization (a growth need).

#### 🎯 Slide 3: What It’s NOT

- Title: “What it’s NOT”
- Use 🚫 bullets with brief explanations:
- 🚫 **It’s not a proven, scientific law.** Maslow’s hierarchy is not well documented by research, and there are questions about its applicability in different cultures.
- 🚫 **It’s not always strictly ordered.** While basic needs are usually dominant, cultural values or specific circumstances (like a political protest) can lead people to intentionally disregard basic needs to pursue higher growth needs.

🗒 Presenter Notes:

- **Clarify what students often get wrong:** The main issue is treating the hierarchy as a literal, unchangeable staircase. Maslow himself acknowledged that the order is flexible.
- **Ask a correction or contrast question:** If a person prioritizes their belief system (a growth need) over their need for food (a basic need) by fasting, does this invalidate Maslow’s theory? (No, Maslow noted culture/circumstances can change the order).
- **Reminder:** Mnemonic: Think of the hierarchy as a **general guideline** for how needs tend to emerge, not a mandatory path.

### Learning Objective 10.1.4: Distinguish between biological, stimulus, and learned motives

#### 🎯 Slide 1: LO 10.1.4: The Three-Way Classification of Motives

- Use this format: # LO 10.1.4: Innate vs. Acquired Drives
- Give 1–2 sentence plain-language definition: Motives can be classified into three broad categories: innate biological needs for survival, innate stimulus needs for information and input, and learned (or social) motives acquired through culture and experience.
- Add 2–3 key bullets highlighting distinctions:
- **Biological Motives:** Essential for individual survival (e.g., air, food, sleep, pain avoidance).
- **Stimulus Motives:** Innate needs for activation and information (e.g., curiosity, exploration, physical contact).
- **Learned Motives (Social Motives):** Acquired needs, often social in nature, such as the need for power, achievement, status, or approval.

🗒 Presenter Notes (required):

- **Clarify:** The key difference between biological and stimulus motives is necessity: Biological ones must be met for survival, while stimulus motives (like curiosity) are innate but not strictly necessary to keep you alive today.
- **Ask:** Why is needing a high grade (GPA) considered a _learned_ motive rather than a biological one?
- **Reminder:** I’ll use the example of monkeys solving puzzles to illustrate a pure stimulus motive.

#### 🎯 Slide 2: What It Looks Like in Real Life

- Title: “What it looks like in real life”
- Start with a ✅ hook: ✅ Why are you checking social media right now? The answer is probably one of these three.
- Give 2–3 vivid, funny, or surprising examples:
- **Biological Motive:** If you are bitterly cold, your motivation is completely consumed by regulating your body temperature, pushing all other drives aside.
- **Stimulus Motive:** A monkey will happily work to open mechanical puzzles, even though no food or external reward is offered, simply for the drive of exploration and manipulation.
- **Learned Motive:** Many human activities, such as running for political office or constantly posting online to seek approval or status, are best explained by acquired learned/social motives.
- End with an optional > quote or punchline:

Your learned social motives are what set you apart from the monkey—unless, of course, the monkey is trying to achieve “Most Innovative Puzzle Solver” status.

🗒 Presenter Notes:

- **Clarify why the examples fit:** The cold/temperature example is purely biological and homeostatic. The monkey puzzle is a perfect, reward-free stimulus drive. The political/social media drive clearly demonstrates learned needs for power, approval, and status.
- **Ask for student examples:** Have students identify one daily activity motivated by each type (e.g., eating lunch - biological; scrolling news - stimulus; working toward a high GPA - learned).
- **Reminder of which example lands best:** Focus on the contrast between the life-sustaining biological motives and the purely exploratory stimulus motives.

#### 🎯 Slide 3: What It’s NOT

- Title: “What it’s NOT”
- Use 🚫 bullets with brief explanations:
- 🚫 **Learned motives are not instincts.** They are acquired through learning, socialization, and cultural conditioning, unlike innate biological or stimulus needs.
- 🚫 **Stimulus needs are not mandatory for individual survival.** Although they are innate, they are defined by the needs for stimulation and information, not essential bodily functions like air or water.

🗒 Presenter Notes:

- **Clarify what students often get wrong:** Sometimes students mistake learned social needs (like the need for power) as being universal instincts. Clarify that while nearly all humans have these, they are developed through cultural interaction (social motives).
- **Ask a correction or contrast question:** If a stimulus motive is innate (like curiosity), why is it categorized separately from biological motives? (Answer: Because biological motives are necessary for homeostasis and survival).
- **Reminder:** Mnemonic: Innate = **B**iological + **S**timulus. Acquired = **L**earned/Social.

The section being addressed is **10.2 Biological Motives**.

### Learning Objective 10.2.1: Explain what is meant by the term sex drive, and how hormones are related to the sex drive of human and nonhuman animals

#### 🎯 Slide 1: LO 10.2.1: The Non-Homeostatic Sex Drive

- Use this format: # LO 10.2.1: The Non-Homeostatic Sex Drive
- Give 1–2 sentence plain-language definition: The **sex drive** refers to the strength of one’s motivation to engage in sexual behavior, and it is largely **non-homeostatic**, meaning it is relatively independent of body need states and deprivation. While necessary for group survival, it is unlike other biological motives because it is not necessary for **individual survival**.
- Add 2–3 key bullets highlighting distinctions:
- In most nonhuman female mammals, the sex drive is highly regulated by **estrogen** levels during a specific fertile period called **estrus** ("heat").
- In humans, the sex drive is influenced by **androgens** (like testosterone) in both men and women, but not as directly as in animals.
- The non-homeostatic quality means that desire can be aroused at virtually any time by almost anything, even shortly after the drive was last satisfied.

🗒 Presenter Notes (required):

- **Clarify:** The key concept here is that this drive is **non-homeostatic**—it doesn't follow the same deprivation cycle as hunger or thirst. People often seek to _arouse_ the sex drive, not just reduce it.
- **Ask:** Given that the sex drive is so independent of physical need, how does that explain why it is used so frequently to sell products (from perfume to cars)?
- **Reminder:** I’ll tell the story about President Calvin Coolidge, his wife, the rooster, and the origin of the **Coolidge effect**.

#### 🎯 Slide 2: What It Looks Like in Real Life

- Title: “What it looks like in real life”
- Start with a ✅ hook: ✅ If you've ever eaten a huge meal and then immediately found room for pie, you understand the difference between need-driven and arousal-driven behavior.
- Give 2–3 vivid, funny, or surprising examples:
- **The Coolidge Effect:** A male animal that appears to be sexually exhausted will often resume sexual activity immediately if a new partner is provided, demonstrating that the drive overrides previous satiety.
- **Hormones and Age:** Because testosterone levels decline with age, androgens (male hormones) can sometimes be supplemented to restore sexual desire in both men and women.
- **The Marketing Angle:** Because the sex drive can be aroused at virtually any time by almost anything, it is one of the most effective tools used in advertising and marketing to motivate behavior.
- End with an optional > quote or punchline:

While the human sex drive is related to hormones, it's capable of motivating a wide range of behaviors—which explains why we use it to sell everything imaginable.

🗒 Presenter Notes:

- **Clarify why the examples fit:** The Coolidge effect highlights that the drive is based on external stimulation (incentive), not internal depletion (need reduction), making it non-homeostatic.
- **Ask for student examples:** Besides being used to sell things, where do you see the sex drive being aroused by something entirely random or non-essential?
- **Reminder of which example lands best:** The story of President Coolidge's response to his wife about the rooster always lands well.

### Learning Objective 10.2.2: Explain what is meant by the term circadian rhythms, and how these rhythms impact human sleep cycles

#### 🎯 Slide 1: LO 10.2.2: The Body’s 24-Hour Internal Clock

- Use this format: # LO 10.2.2: The Body’s 24-Hour Internal Clock
- Give 1–2 sentence plain-language definition: A **circadian rhythm** is a 24-hour biological cycle governing activities like body temperature, blood pressure, and hormone levels, which dictates when we feel motivated and alert throughout the day.
- Add 2–3 key bullets highlighting distinctions:
- Alertness, motivation, and other body activities generally peak once a day at the high point of the rhythm.
- **"Day people"** have early peaks, waking up alert and energetic, while **"night people"** have later peaks, waking groggy and staying lively late.
- When rhythms fall "out of sync" with day-night cycles (due to shift work or long flights), sleep difficulties, fatigue, and irritability follow.

🗒 Presenter Notes (required):

- **Clarify:** The hormone **melatonin** (often nicknamed the “Dracula hormone”) is key; it rises when light falls and helps synchronize these rhythms to the external day/night cycle.
- **Ask:** If you are a "night person" but have an 8 a.m. class, how is your circadian rhythm working against your academic success?
- **Reminder:** I’ll use the 4 a.m. nuclear accident example to show how serious the rhythm low point can be.

#### 🎯 Slide 2: What It Looks Like in Real Life

- Title: “What it looks like in real life”
- Start with a ✅ hook: ✅ Your body has a built-in time schedule, and ignoring it can make you sleepy, clumsy, and prone to international travel-related meltdowns.
- Give 2–3 vivid, funny, or surprising examples:
- **Jet Lag and Shift Work:** Rapid travel across time zones or working an unconventional shift throws the circadian rhythm out of phase with the sun, leading to a host of symptoms like upset stomach and depression.
- **The 4 a.m. Low Point:** Many people reach their lowest point in alertness and core body temperature two to three hours before they usually wake up, which partially explains why both the Chernobyl and Three-Mile Island nuclear accidents occurred around 4 a.m..
- **Preadapting:** You can reduce sleep difficulties before a trip by gradually shifting your sleep schedule (e.g., one hour later each day) until it matches the time at your destination.
- End with an optional > quote or punchline:

You may be motivated to do as much during one hour in the morning as you could have done in three hours of work after midnight.

🗒 Presenter Notes:

- **Clarify why the examples fit:** The accidents and jet lag demonstrate the negative effects of disequilibrium. The suggestion to preadapt is a concrete action to restore equilibrium.
- **Ask for student examples:** Has anyone successfully used light exposure (bright morning light) or melatonin to manage a disrupted sleep schedule?
- **Reminder of which example lands best:** The practical advice about preadaptation is an insightful tip for students who travel for holidays.

### Learning Objective 10.2.3: Outline why pain is considered an episodic drive, and how our responses to pain are shaped

#### 🎯 Slide 1: LO 10.2.3: Pain Avoidance: The Episodic Drive

- Use this format: # LO 10.2.3: Pain Avoidance: The Episodic Drive
- Give 1–2 sentence plain-language definition: Pain avoidance is an **episodic drive**—occurring in distinct, non-cyclic episodes when physical damage takes place—that motivates us to avoid or eliminate sources of discomfort, rather than seek a positive goal.
- Add 2–3 key bullets highlighting distinctions:
- Unlike hunger or thirst, which are cyclic, pain is triggered suddenly and temporarily, only when the body is threatened.
- **Pain tolerance** (how much pain we show or endure) is partly **learned** through observing family, friends, and other role models.
- Cultural practices and beliefs strongly influence the motivation to avoid discomfort, allowing some people to endure practices that would agonize others.

🗒 Presenter Notes (required):

- **Clarify:** Most drives (hunger, thirst) _push_ you toward a goal (food, water). Pain _pushes_ you away from the discomfort.
- **Ask:** If a child sees their soccer coach shake off a minor injury without complaint, how might this shape the child's learned response to pain?
- **Reminder:** I’ll use the example of body modification/piercing devotees to illustrate the power of learned pain tolerance.

#### 🎯 Slide 2: What It Looks Like in Real Life

- Title: “What it looks like in real life”
- Start with a ✅ hook: ✅ We often learn how to react to pain not from our bodies, but from our parents.
- Give 2–3 vivid, funny, or surprising examples:
- **Cultural Endurance:** Members of some societies, influenced by their cultural practices and beliefs, willingly endure activities like cutting, burning, or whipping, demonstrating a high learned **pain tolerance**.
- **High Tolerance/Low Complaint:** A person who believes they must be "tough" raises their pain tolerance, minimizing outward signs of distress.
- **Low Tolerance/Loud Complaint:** A person who observes role models complaining loudly at small aches may develop a lower pain tolerance themselves.
- End with an optional > quote or punchline:

Whether it’s getting a tattoo or avoiding stubbing your toe, the drive to avoid discomfort is shaped by who you watch.

🗒 Presenter Notes:

- **Clarify why the examples fit:** The key idea is that the _drive_ to avoid pain (and the tolerance level) is psychologically and socially determined, even though the sensation itself is biological.
- **Ask for student examples:** Think about a time you tried to "tough it out" when you were hurt—were you driven by personal motivation or external social expectations?
- **Reminder of which example lands best:** Focus on the contrast between the innate sensation and the learned _response_ to that sensation.

#### 🎯 Slide 3: What It’s NOT

- Only include if misconceptions are common: _Misconceptions about pain being purely biological are common._
- Title: “What it’s NOT”
- Use 🚫 bullets with brief explanations:
- 🚫 **It’s not just an instinct.** Although pain alerts the body to damage, the _drive_ to avoid it, and the level of tolerance, are heavily influenced by learning and cultural beliefs.
- 🚫 **It’s not cyclic.** Unlike the recurring, regulated cycles of hunger and sleep, pain avoidance is **episodic**—it only occurs when damage is happening or about to happen.

🗒 Presenter Notes:

- **Clarify what students often get wrong:** Don't confuse the biological signal of pain with the psychological response/tolerance for it. Tolerance is adjustable.
- **Ask a correction or contrast question:** Can a person be trained to ignore hunger? Yes. Can a person be trained to ignore pain? (Yes, to an extent, as seen in some cultural practices).
- **Reminder:** Mnemonic: Pain avoidance is **E**pisodic, not **E**veryday.

### Learning Objective 10.2.4: Distinguish between intracellular and extracellular thirst, and how each is best managed

#### 🎯 Slide 1: LO 10.2.4: The Two Thirst Systems

- Use this format: # LO 10.2.4: The Two Thirst Systems
- Give 1–2 sentence plain-language definition: Thirst is managed by the hypothalamus, which detects two different types of body fluid loss: **extracellular thirst** (loss of water from surrounding cells) and **intracellular thirst** (fluid drawn _out_ of cells due to high salt concentration).
- Add 2–3 key bullets highlighting distinctions:
- **Extracellular thirst** is caused by fluid loss from bleeding, vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, or drinking alcohol.
- **Intracellular thirst** is caused by eating too much salt, which increases the salt concentration outside the cells, drawing water out and causing the cells to shrink.
- Each type is managed differently: extracellular thirst requires salty liquids (like Gatorade) to restore water and minerals, while intracellular thirst requires plain water.

🗒 Presenter Notes (required):

- **Clarify:** Thirst is only partially controlled by a dry mouth; the hypothalamus is the real master regulator. A key distinction is whether you are lacking _volume_ (extracellular) or have an excess of _salt_ (intracellular).
- **Ask:** If you felt extremely thirsty after eating chips, should you reach for a sports drink or plain water? (Answer: Water, because chips cause intracellular thirst).
- **Reminder:** I’ll emphasize the importance of salt in managing extracellular thirst (e.g., post-sweating).

#### 🎯 Slide 2: What It Looks Like in Real Life

- Title: “What it looks like in real life”
- Start with a ✅ hook: ✅ Feeling thirsty is complex; sometimes your cells are dehydrated, and sometimes the space between them is empty.
- Give 2–3 vivid, funny, or surprising examples:
- **The Salty Meal:** Eating a salty meal causes **intracellular thirst** because salt concentrations rise outside the cells, pulling water from the cells themselves. Only plain water can effectively quench this.
- **The Marathon Runner:** A person suffering from intense, prolonged sweating experiences **extracellular thirst** (loss of water and minerals) and finds a slightly salty liquid, like a sports drink, more satisfying than plain water.
- **The Alcohol Effect:** Drinking alcohol causes fluid loss, resulting in extracellular thirst, which is part of the reason hangovers involve intense thirst.
- End with an optional > quote or punchline:

Don’t blame the bartender or the gym—just make sure you match your drink to your specific type of cellular crisis.

🗒 Presenter Notes:

- **Clarify why the examples fit:** The salty meal is the best example of intracellular thirst (salt pulls water out). The marathon runner is the best example of extracellular thirst (fluid volume loss).
- **Ask for student examples:** Discuss a time they drank a salty liquid (like broth or soup) to quench thirst after being sick or exercising heavily.
- **Reminder of which example lands best:** Highlighting the difference between what quenches salt-induced thirst (water) and what quenches fluid-loss thirst (salty liquid) is the most effective point.

### Learning Objective 10.2.5: Outline the internal and external factors that impact hunger

#### 🎯 Slide 1: LO 10.2.5: Hunger Factors: Push vs. Pull

- Use this format: # LO 10.2.5: Hunger Factors: Push vs. Pull
- Give 1–2 sentence plain-language definition: Hunger is managed by a complex interplay of **internal bodily factors** (homeostasis, blood chemistry, and brain regions) and **external factors** (sensory cues, culture, and food availability).
- Add 2–3 key bullets highlighting distinctions:
- Internally, the **hypothalamus** regulates eating using a lateral area (the "start button") and a ventromedial area (the "stop button").
- The brain controls long-term weight by maintaining a **set point for fat**, which releases the substance **leptin** when fat stores are well inflated to signal satiety.
- Externally, **eating cues** (sight/smell of food) and the variety of food available can override biological needs, significantly contributing to overeating.

🗒 Presenter Notes (required):

- **Clarify:** Although stomach growling is noticeable, the stomach is _not_ essential for feeling hunger; the hypothalamus and blood sugar (glucose) levels are far more important internal factors.
- **Ask:** If you are well-fed, what external factors make you reach for that bowl of ice cream anyway? (Think about the "pull" of external cues/incentives).
- **Reminder:** I’ll note that it takes at least 10 minutes for the brain's satiety system to kick in, which is why we should eat slowly.

#### 🎯 Slide 2: What It Looks Like in Real Life

- Title: “What it looks like in real life”
- Start with a ✅ hook: ✅ If internal needs controlled eating, nearly three-quarters of Americans wouldn't be classified as overweight or obese.
- Give 2–3 vivid, funny, or surprising examples:
- **The “Frosh 15”:** College freshmen often gain weight because they become highly sensitive to **external eating cues** like all-you-can-eat dining halls and easily available nighttime snacks.
- **The Taste Aversion Shield:** If you eat grapefruit and later feel ill, your body develops a **taste aversion** for grapefruit, illustrating a biological preparedness that protects us from eating unhealthy foods.
- **The Portion Problem:** The availability of high-sugar, high-fat foods, and the prevalence of “super-sized” meals (25% larger in the US than in France), acts as a powerful external factor encouraging overeating.
- End with an optional > quote or punchline:

Super-sized meals are bad enough, but variety is the real killer: If you overdose on one tasty food, you can easily shift to another (like cheesecake) instead of stopping.

🗒 Presenter Notes:

- **Clarify why the examples fit:** The Frosh 15 shows the power of the environment/cues. Taste aversion shows a protective learning mechanism. The portion size comparison illustrates the dramatic effect of external incentives and culture.
- **Ask for student examples:** What foods do you have a personal taste aversion to, and do you know how that dislike was originally created?
- **Reminder of which example lands best:** The concept of **taste aversion** often surprises students because the sickness can occur hours after eating.

#### 🎯 Slide 3: What It’s NOT

- Title: “What it’s NOT”
- Use 🚫 bullets with brief explanations:
- 🚫 **Radical dieting is not effective.** "Yo-yo dieting" (repeated losing and gaining) slows the body’s **metabolism**, making it more efficient at storing calories and potentially raising the set point for fat.
- 🚫 **The set point can't be easily changed.** Currently, there is no known way to lower your set point for fat, as the number of fat cells remains unchanged in adult life.
- 🚫 **Hunger is not a reliable indicator of nutritional need.** External cues and psychological factors often push people to eat when their biological needs are already satisfied.

🗒 Presenter Notes:

- **Clarify what students often get wrong:** Students often believe willpower (starvation/radical dieting) is the answer. Clarify that **behavioral dieting** (permanent change in habits and exercise) is the only proven approach because it avoids dropping the metabolic rate.
- **Ask a correction or contrast question:** Why is it dangerous to starve yourself (diet) before a holiday dinner? (You slow your metabolism, making you store more of the incoming calories as fat).
- **Reminder:** Mnemonic: Dieting is a temporary **FAD**; behavioral change is the **GOAL**.

### Learning Objective 10.2.6: Distinguish between anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, and outline the causes of these eating disorders

#### 🎯 Slide 1: LO 10.2.6: Anorexia vs. Bulimia

- Use this format: # LO 10.2.6: The Drive for Dangerous Control
- Give 1–2 sentence plain-language definition: **Anorexia nervosa** involves a life-threatening refusal to maintain sufficient body weight due to an intense, exaggerated fear of becoming fat, while **bulimia nervosa** is characterized by recurring episodes of binge eating followed by purging to prevent weight gain.
- Add 2–3 key bullets highlighting distinctions:
- Anorexia has the highest mortality rate of all mental illnesses and is defined by the severe physical symptom of maintaining body weight at 85% or less of normal.
- Bulimia involves the highly reinforcing cycle of bingeing followed by purging (vomiting, laxatives, or excessive exercise), leading to severe damage like kidney damage and tooth erosion.
- A common underlying cause for both is **extreme dissatisfaction** with body image, low self-esteem, and a compulsive desire to gain **self-control**.

🗒 Presenter Notes (required):

- **Clarify:** While anorexics starve themselves, they typically _still feel physical hunger_—their compulsion to lose weight overrides the biological drive. Bingeing _without_ purging is a separate disorder called binge eating disorder.
- **Ask:** Why might the anxiety reduction that comes from purging make bulimia such a hard habit to break?
- **Reminder:** I’ll emphasize that both men and women struggle with body image distortion, including **muscle dysmorphia** in men.

#### 🎯 Slide 2: What It Looks Like in Real Life

- Title: “What it looks like in real life”
- Start with a ✅ hook: ✅ When the mirror gives a distorted image, the drive for control can become a matter of life and death.
- Give 2–3 vivid, funny, or surprising examples:
- **Distorted Self-Image:** Women with eating disorders often overestimate their body size by 25% or more, viewing themselves as "fat" even as they are dangerously underweight.
- **Control Conflicts:** Anorexic teen girls are often model children—helpful and obedient—suggesting that the disorder is their way of achieving "perfect control" in their lives by controlling their weight.
- **The Media Influence:** The pressure from idealized body images in fashion magazines and online sources can make women less satisfied with their weight and increase the risk of distorted body images.
- End with an optional > quote or punchline:

It's a self-defeating spiral: Vomiting temporarily reduces the anxiety, which is why the purging behavior becomes highly reinforcing.

🗒 Presenter Notes:

- **Clarify why the examples fit:** The "perfect daughter" and the purging cycle illustrate the underlying conflicts of control and anxiety. The distortion example highlights the cognitive component (appraisal).
- **Ask for student examples:** Discuss why certain sports (like gymnastics or wrestling) might have a higher risk for these disorders.
- **Reminder of which example lands best:** Use the statistic about overestimating body size (25%) to drive home the severity of the cognitive distortion.

#### 🎯 Slide 3: What It’s NOT

- Title: “What it’s NOT”
- Use 🚫 bullets with brief explanations:
- 🚫 **It’s not just a teenage girl problem.** One-quarter of anorexics and bulimics are now male, and men are increasingly experiencing muscle dysmorphia (worrying about being muscular enough).
- 🚫 **It’s not just a matter of choice or vanity.** These are severe mental illnesses, and anorexia has the highest mortality rate of all psychological disorders.
- 🚫 **It's not always easy to treat.** Most sufferers do not seek help on their own, often requiring strong urging from family and friends to begin treatment.

🗒 Presenter Notes:

- **Clarify what students often get wrong:** The main misconception is that men are immune, or that the disorders are simply "dieting that went too far." Stress the severity and wide demographic range.
- **Ask a correction or contrast question:** Since men are less likely to express emotions like fear or sadness, why might this "blunted emotion" contribute to the rise of eating disorders in males? (Anger may be the only acceptable emotion, or the inability to express feelings prevents them from seeking help).
- **Reminder:** Mnemonic: Remember the **M**edia and the desperate need for **C**ontrol (**M**uscle **C**onflicts).

The section being addressed is **10.3 Stimulus and Learned Motives**.

### Learning Objective 10.3.1: Explain the central idea that underlies arousal theory

#### 🎯 Slide 1: LO 10.3.1: Arousal Theory: Staying in the Zone

- Use this format: # LO 10.3.1: Arousal Theory: Staying in the Zone
- Give 1–2 sentence plain-language definition: **Arousal theory** assumes that we are motivated to keep the activation of our bodies and nervous systems at an ideal, or comfortable, level. We seek to raise arousal when bored ("too low") and lower it when anxious ("too high") to achieve a state of homeostasis.
- Add 2–3 key bullets highlighting distinctions:
- Arousal refers to the **activation of the body and nervous system**, ranging from zero at death to high during panic or intense emotion.
- Stimulus motives (like curiosity and exploration) are considered homeostatic because they help maintain this optimal level of arousal.
- The right mix of activities is sought to prevent both boredom (arousal too low) and overstimulation (arousal too high).

🗒 Presenter Notes (required):

- **Clarify:** Arousal doesn't just mean "sexual arousal." In this context, it refers to general physiological and nervous system activation. The goal is not zero arousal, but a _comfortable_ level.
- **Ask:** If you’re stuck waiting in a boring line, what do you automatically do (e.g., check your phone) to raise your arousal level?
- **Reminder:** I’ll use the example of monkeys solving mechanical puzzles just for the "sheer fun of it" to illustrate the stimulus motive pushing for arousal.

#### 🎯 Slide 2: What It Looks Like in Real Life

- Title: “What it looks like in real life”
- Start with a ✅ hook: ✅ Whether you're choosing your next class, your next video game, or your next vacation, you're looking for that perfect level of "activated."
- Give 2–3 vivid, funny, or surprising examples:
- **The Bored Student:** A student who feels sleepy, lazy, or bored in class (arousal too low) finds their performance suffering.
- **The Sensation Seeker:** Individuals high in **sensation seeking** (a trait of people who prefer high levels of stimulation) might choose activities like scuba diving with sharks over a quiet cottage vacation.
- **The Dark Side:** People high in sensation seeking are more likely to engage in high-risk behaviors such as substance abuse, smoking, and casual unprotected sex.
- End with an optional > quote or punchline:

If the shark adventure attracts you, congratulations: You’re officially motivated by the trait of sensation seeking.

🗒 Presenter Notes:

- **Clarify why the examples fit:** Boredom/sleepiness shows the consequences of low arousal, which motivates a person to seek stimulation. The sensation seeking examples show how some people naturally have a higher "optimal" set point for arousal.
- **Ask for student examples:** Ask students to identify if they generally consider themselves "high" or "low" sensation seekers based on their preferred weekend activities.
- **Reminder of which example lands best:** The high-risk behaviors associated with high sensation seeking often surprise students, so emphasize that distinction.

### Learning Objective 10.3.2: Describe the relationship between arousal and performance, as outlined in the Yerkes-Dodson law

#### 🎯 Slide 1: LO 10.3.2: The Yerkes-Dodson Law (The Inverted U)

- Use this format: # LO 10.3.2: The Yerkes-Dodson Law (The Inverted U)
- Give 1–2 sentence plain-language definition: The **Yerkes-Dodson law** describes the relationship between arousal and performance, stating that performance usually forms an inverted, or upside-down, **U function**. Optimal performance generally occurs when arousal is at a moderate level.
- Add 2–3 key bullets highlighting distinctions:
- At very **low arousal**, performance suffers because a person is not sufficiently energized.
- At very **high arousal**, performance also drops off because the person becomes anxious, disorganized, or emotional (e.g., test anxiety).
- The _ideal_ level of arousal depends on **task complexity**: As a task becomes more difficult or complex, the optimal level of arousal for peak performance becomes lower.

🗒 Presenter Notes (required):

- **Clarify:** It’s critical to remember that "moderate" arousal is best only for moderately challenging tasks. For a very simple, well-practiced task, high arousal won't hurt performance.
- **Ask:** If you have to give a speech, would you prefer to be slightly nervous or extremely calm? Why?
- **Reminder:** I’ll use the example of manager Yingfang preparing for a big presentation to illustrate the three levels of task complexity (setting up the projector, giving the speech, and answering unpredictable questions).

#### 🎯 Slide 2: What It Looks Like in Real Life

- Title: “What it looks like in real life”
- Start with a ✅ hook: ✅ High-stakes tasks require precision; low-stakes tasks require minimal effort. The more difficult the task, the chiller you need to be.
- Give 2–3 vivid, funny, or surprising examples:
- **The Simple Task (High Arousal OK):** Manager Yingfang setting up a projector (a simple, well-practiced task) benefits from rising arousal, which focuses her attention, and high arousal won't compromise her performance.
- **The Complex Task (Low Arousal Needed):** Answering unpredictable client questions (a very complex, less-practiced task) requires a lower optimal level of arousal; high arousal will cause performance to decline sooner than with an easier task.
- **Test Anxiety (High Arousal Failure):** High levels of arousal combined with worry (test anxiety) seriously impair test performance because the anxiety distracts students with upsetting thoughts and feelings.
- End with an optional > quote or punchline:

For difficult tasks, the inverted-U curve moves to the left: Your best performance is achieved when you’re less stressed.

🗒 Presenter Notes:

- **Clarify why the examples fit:** Yingfang's tasks demonstrate that the same person performs differently under the same rising pressure, depending on how difficult the task is.
- **Ask for student examples:** Ask students to share an experience where high anxiety actually helped them focus on an easy task, but hurt them on a harder, more complex assignment.
- **Reminder of which example lands best:** Focus on the test anxiety examples, as students can directly apply coping strategies like preparation and relaxation to lower unproductive arousal.

### Learning Objective 10.3.3: Outline what is meant by the need for achievement (nAch) and need for power

#### 🎯 Slide 1: LO 10.3.3: The Social Motives: Achievement & Power

- Use this format: # LO 10.3.3: Driven by Success or Status?
- Give 1–2 sentence plain-language definition: Learned motives, also known as **social motives**, are acquired through culture and socialization and include the **need for achievement (nAch)** (the drive to excel in one's endeavors) and the **need for power** (the desire to have impact or control over others).
- Add 2–3 key bullets highlighting distinctions:
- People high in **nAch** strive to do well whenever they are evaluated, exhibiting perseverance, passion, and self-confidence. They attribute success to their own ability and failure to insufficient effort.
- High nAch is often driven by **intrinsic motives** (enjoying challenges and testing abilities), not necessarily extrinsic motives (seeking money or prestige).
- People with a strong **need for power** want their importance to be visible; they buy expensive possessions and exploit relationships to gain control.

🗒 Presenter Notes (required):

- **Clarify:** The key difference is the goal: nAch seeks _excellence_ (internal standard), while the need for power seeks _impact/control_ over others (external standard).
- **Ask:** If someone becomes a professional gamer purely because they love the challenge of mastering a complex game, is that nAch or the need for power? (nAch, especially if it’s intrinsically motivated).
- **Reminder:** I’ll use the example of Venus and Serena Williams to showcase the persistence and passion of high nAch.

#### 🎯 Slide 2: What It Looks Like in Real Life

- Title: “What it looks like in real life”
- Start with a ✅ hook: ✅ Not everyone who excels is motivated by the same desire; some want mastery, others just want the biggest car.
- Give 2–3 vivid, funny, or surprising examples:
- **The High Achiever:** High-nAch students earn better grades and are more likely to renew their efforts when they perform poorly because they attribute failure to fixable insufficient effort.
- **The Intrinsic Achiever:** A high achiever in science or amateur sports may excel simply because they relish the chance to test their abilities, driven by intrinsic motives rather than a desire for wealth.
- **The Power Seeker:** People with a strong need for power often buy prestigious clothes and expensive possessions to make their importance visible, sometimes exploiting relationships in the process.
- End with an optional > quote or punchline:

People whose main goal in life is just to make lots of money tend to be poorly adjusted and unhappy.

🗒 Presenter Notes:

- **Clarify why the examples fit:** The student example highlights the _attributional style_ of high nAch (effort, not lack of ability). The power seeker shows the visible, material focus of that particular social motive.
- **Ask for student examples:** Discuss a time when they were motivated purely by the desire to master a skill, regardless of the grade or reward (intrinsic nAch).
- **Reminder of which example lands best:** Emphasize the long-term payoff of intrinsic nAch (perseverance, success) over the dark side of the need for power (unhappiness).

### Learning Objective 10.3.4: Explain the central idea that underlies opponent-process theory

#### 🎯 Slide 1: LO 10.3.4: Opponent-Process Theory: The Emotional Seesaw

- Use this format: # LO 10.3.4: Opponent-Process Theory: The Emotional Seesaw
- Give 1–2 sentence plain-language definition: **Opponent-process theory** explains how people learn to enjoy activities that are initially painful or frightening by proposing that strong emotions are followed by the opposite emotional state when the stimulus ends.
- Add 2–3 key bullets highlighting distinctions:
- The core concept is that if a stimulus causes a strong emotion (e.g., fear), the opposite emotion (e.g., relief or pleasure) tends to occur when the stimulus is terminated.
- When a strong stimulus (even a frightening one) is **repeated**, the initial emotional response (e.g., fear) gets **weaker**, and the opposing emotional aftereffect (e.g., euphoria/thrill) gets **stronger**.
- This theory explains how initially painful or scary activities like skydiving or running marathons become highly reinforcing over time due to the intensified pleasurable aftereffect.

🗒 Presenter Notes (required):

- **Clarify:** The theory suggests that we are motivated by the _after-effect_, not the initial scary part. The pleasure after a painful event (pain ends $\rightarrow$ relief) or a scary event (fear ends $\rightarrow$ euphoria) is what drives repetition.
- **Ask:** If someone uses a drug for pleasure, and the pleasure ends, what does the opponent-process theory predict will happen immediately after? (Craving or discomfort—the opposite emotion).
- **Reminder:** I’ll use the hang glider example to clearly explain how initial terror becomes later "thrill".

#### 🎯 Slide 2: What It Looks Like in Real Life

- Title: “What it looks like in real life”
- Start with a ✅ hook: ✅ Why pay money to scare yourself? Because the relief feels twice as good once it's over.
- Give 2–3 vivid, funny, or surprising examples:
- **The First Flight:** A first-time hang glider is terrified, but afterward feels a brief, exhilarating sense of relief.
- **The Addiction Cycle:** Drug use causes intense pleasure; when the pleasure ends, it is immediately followed by the opposite emotion: discomfort or craving.
- **The Seasoned Thrill Seeker:** After many flights, the hang glider's initial terror decreases, and they feel a strong "rush" of euphoria that lasts for hours, making the dangerous pursuit highly reinforcing.
- End with an optional > quote or punchline:

If you are a fan of horror movies, carnival rides, or bungee jumping, your motives may be based on the emotional “after-party”.

🗒 Presenter Notes:

- **Clarify why the examples fit:** The key is repetition. The first flight/thrill is primarily relief; subsequent flights/thrills are primarily euphoria because the initial fear weakens and the opposite emotional aftereffect strengthens.
- **Ask for student examples:** Have students relate this to exercise, like running. The initial pain/discomfort often gives way to a sense of well-being or "runner's high" afterward.
- **Reminder of which example lands best:** Focus on the "love at first fright" concept, where activities like skydiving become highly desirable due to the intense aftereffect.

#### 🎯 Slide 3: What It’s NOT

- Title: “What it’s NOT”
- Use 🚫 bullets with brief explanations:
- 🚫 **It’s not just relief.** While the first experience may generate only a brief sense of relief, the theory hinges on the fact that _repeated_ exposure causes the intense aftereffect (the opponent process) to become dominant and last longer.
- 🚫 **It’s not only about fear.** The theory applies to any strong emotion, including pleasure (like drug use, followed by craving/discomfort) or love (followed by discomfort/craving for the partner when they are absent).

🗒 Presenter Notes:

- **Clarify what students often get wrong:** Students often mistakenly believe that the initial response _strengthens_ with repetition. Clarify that the initial response weakens, and the _aftereffect_ (the opposite emotion) strengthens.
- **Ask a correction or contrast question:** According to the theory, does running a marathon get easier after the first time? (The initial pain/discomfort of the run itself may lessen slightly, but the pleasurable rush afterward intensifies, making the activity more reinforcing).
- **Reminder:** Mnemonic: **O**pponent-**P**rocess **T**heory. **O**pposite feeling **P**ersists and **T**oughens up.

The section being addressed is **10.4 The Four Basic Aspects of Emotion**.

### Learning Objective 10.4.1: Outline the four basic aspects of an emotion

#### 🎯 Slide 1: LO 10.4.1: Emotion’s Four Components

- Use this format: # LO 10.4.1: Emotion’s Four Components
- Give 1–2 sentence plain-language definition: An **emotion** is a feeling state characterized by four basic, tightly connected components: **experience** (subjective feelings), **physiology** (bodily changes), **expression** (visible signs), and **cognitions** (thoughts and appraisals).
- Add 2–3 key bullets highlighting distinctions:
- Historically, thinkers focused mainly on **cognition** (rational thinking), often seeing emotion as something to be controlled, but modern psychology views the two as tightly intertwined.
- Emotional **experience** is the subjective feeling (what anger "feels like"), which people intuitively understand and label.
- **Physiology** involves automatic responses in the autonomic nervous system (ANS) that prepare the body for "fighting or fleeing" or calming it down.

🗒 Presenter Notes (required):

- **Clarify:** The key nuance is that while we often talk about feeling an emotion (experience), an emotion is a complex state that requires all four components (feelings, body changes, visible signs, and thought processes).
- **Ask:** When you feel suddenly stressed, which component—the physiological (pounding heart) or the cognitive (worry)—do you usually notice first?
- **Reminder:** I’ll use Halima Aden’s story: her anxiety (experience) turning to relief (opposite experience) once her fears about the pageant staff were addressed (cognition/appraisal).

### Learning Objective 10.4.2: Explain what is meant by emotional experience, and how it differs from mood

#### 🎯 Slide 1: LO 10.4.2: Emotion vs. Mood: Duration and Target

- Use this format: # LO 10.4.2: Emotion vs. Mood: Duration and Target
- Give 1–2 sentence plain-language definition: **Emotional experience** refers to the private, subjective feelings we label (like anger or sadness). **Moods** are a specific type of emotional state that differs from emotions in two key ways: duration and target.
- Add 2–3 key bullets highlighting distinctions:
- **Emotions** are generally brief, lasting seconds or minutes. **Moods** are long-lasting, potentially extending for hours, days, or months.
- **Emotions** usually have a clear **target** (we are mad _about something_ specific). **Moods** are more general and are not necessarily directed at anything in particular.
- Moods are closely tied to **circadian rhythms**; when body temperature is low (e.g., Monday or Tuesday), mood is likely to be lower, and vice versa.

🗒 Presenter Notes (required):

- **Clarify:** Although the words are used interchangeably in daily life, psychologists emphasize the difference. Think of an emotion as a quick burst of feeling caused by an event, and a mood as the background music of your day.
- **Ask:** If you wake up on a Tuesday morning feeling generally irritable for no clear reason, is that an emotion or a mood, and why?
- **Reminder:** I’ll use the "Blue Monday" example to illustrate how moods tend to rise and fall with the weekly schedule.

#### 🎯 Slide 2: What It Looks Like in Real Life

- Title: “What it looks like in real life”
- Start with a ✅ hook: ✅ Sometimes you’re excited _about_ a new movie (emotion), and sometimes you’re just generally happy _to be alive_ (mood).
- Give 2–3 vivid, funny, or surprising examples:
- **The Low-Point Mood:** For many students, average daily moods tend to be lowest around Monday or Tuesday, coinciding with the low point in their weekly schedules.
- **The High-Point Mood:** Moods generally peak on Friday or Saturday, corresponding to the high point in the weekly schedule.
- **The Targeted Feeling:** When we feel anger, sadness, or excitement, it is typically directed at something or someone specific, providing the clear target that defines an emotion.
- End with an optional > quote or punchline:

Your mood might be down because it’s Monday, but your emotion is anger because your roommate ate your leftovers.

🗒 Presenter Notes:

- **Clarify why the examples fit:** The weekly mood cycles demonstrate how moods are long-lasting and often without a specific target, correlating instead with circadian rhythms.
- **Ask for student examples:** Ask students to identify a time when they felt a general mood change that seemed to shift purely based on the day of the week.
- **Reminder of which example lands best:** The concept of "Blue Monday" is relatable, emphasizing how moods are shaped by weekly schedules.

### Learning Objective 10.4.3: Describe the physiological responses that are associated with emotions

#### 🎯 Slide 1: LO 10.4.3: Your Body on Emotion

- Use this format: # LO 10.4.3: Your Body on Emotion
- Give 1–2 sentence plain-language definition: Strong emotions trigger physiological changes largely controlled by the **autonomic nervous system (ANS)**, which has two branches that automatically manage arousal: the sympathetic branch (activating) and the parasympathetic branch (calming).
- Add 2–3 key bullets highlighting distinctions:
- The **sympathetic branch** activates the body for **"fighting or fleeing"** by increasing heart rate, releasing blood sugar, dilating bronchi, and inhibiting digestion.
- The **parasympathetic branch** works to reverse emotional arousal, calming and relaxing the body by slowing the heart rate and restoring balance.
- The brain's **amygdala** receives sensory information directly, allowing a **"quick and dirty"**, automatic fear response before the cerebral cortex is involved.

🗒 Presenter Notes (required):

- **Clarify:** The sympathetic system responds quickly during an emergency, but the parasympathetic system responds much more slowly. That’s why a pounding heart can persist for 20 to 30 minutes after an intense emotion.
- **Ask:** Why might someone faint after seeing a shocking accident, even if they aren't hurt themselves? (Hint: Parasympathetic overreaction).
- **Reminder:** I’ll use the rattlesnake test described by LeDoux to demonstrate the amygdala’s fast, automatic role in fear.

#### 🎯 Slide 2: What It Looks Like in Real Life

- Title: “What it looks like in real life”
- Start with a ✅ hook: ✅ Whether you’re running from a lion or a late-night mugger, your body’s preparation for survival is identical.
- Give 2–3 vivid, funny, or surprising examples:
- **The Amygdala Bypass:** If a rattlesnake strikes at your face through zoo glass, you will likely flinch, even though you cognitively know you are safe, because the amygdala processes the threat immediately, bypassing the higher brain centers.
- **The Shock/Faint Response:** After a strong emotional shock, the parasympathetic system may over-react and lower blood pressure too much, causing a person to become dizzy or faint.
- **The Lie Detector Test:** A polygraph attempts to measure the bodily changes (heart rate, blood pressure, GSR) caused by the sympathetic branch during questioning, based on the assumption that lying causes general emotional arousal.
- End with an optional > quote or punchline:

Your amygdala is faster than your conscious brain. Think of it as the brain’s "instant reflex" button, just in case a plastic snake jumps out.

🗒 Presenter Notes:

- **Clarify why the examples fit:** The fainting and lie detector examples demonstrate the specific functions of the ANS branches. The snake example is perfect for illustrating the amygdala's automatic, subcortical circuit for processing immediate danger.
- **Ask for student examples:** Ask students to recall a time they experienced "butterflies in the stomach" (sympathetic inhibition of digestion) and how long it took their body to fully calm down afterward (parasympathetic slowness).
- **Reminder of which example lands best:** The concept of the amygdala processing fear before the cortex is a fascinating neuroscientific point to emphasize.

#### 🎯 Slide 3: What It’s NOT

- Only include if misconceptions are common: _Misconceptions about lie detectors and emotional specificity are common._
- Title: “What it’s NOT”
- Use 🚫 bullets with brief explanations:
- 🚫 **The polygraph is not a "lie detector."** It records general emotional arousal (heart rate, breathing, sweating) but cannot distinguish between lying and fear, anxiety, or excitement.
- 🚫 **The limbic system is not the only place emotions are processed.** While the amygdala handles fast, involuntary fear, most emotions are eventually processed in the cortex for elaborate reflection.

🗒 Presenter Notes:

- **Clarify what students often get wrong:** Students often think the polygraph is definitive proof of lying. Clarify that it has a high rate of labeling innocent people as guilty and should not be used for screening employees.
- **Ask a correction or contrast question:** If a nervous, innocent person fails a polygraph test, what component of the ANS caused the failure? (The sympathetic arousal caused by fear/anxiety, not guilt).
- **Reminder:** Mnemonic: The **P**olygraph measures **P**hysiology, not **P**roof.

### Learning Objective 10.4.4: Outline the various ways in which an emotion can be expressed and regulated

#### 🎯 Slide 1: LO 10.4.4: Expression and Regulation

- Use this format: # LO 10.4.4: Emotion: Display and Control
- Give 1–2 sentence plain-language definition: Emotion **expression** involves communicating feelings through multiple channels, including facial expressions, body language (**kinesics**), and vocal tone. **Emotion regulation** is the active management of these expressions, often to suppress or alter the emotional state being shown.
- Add 2–3 key bullets highlighting distinctions:
- Facial displays likely evolved to communicate feelings quickly, evidenced by our ability to rapidly detect **threatening faces** (angry/scheming).
- **Kinesics** (body language) includes posture, eye gaze, and touch, and can reliably communicate emotions like shame (slumped posture) or gratitude.
- Suppressing negative emotions (a type of regulation) uses a lot of effort, **increases sympathetic nervous system activity**, and can impair thinking and memory.

🗒 Presenter Notes (required):

- **Clarify:** The source material uses the example of an angry tiger baring its teeth, highlighting that emotional expressions have evolutionary significance because they communicate intent, aiding survival.
- **Ask:** If you are trying to hide your anger from a boss, which regulation strategy are you using, and what is the potential internal cost? (Response modulation/suppression; increased sympathetic arousal).
- **Reminder:** I’ll use the example of women’s higher rate of **alexithymia** (difficulty naming emotions) due to cultural conditioning to suppress certain feelings.

#### 🎯 Slide 2: What It Looks Like in Real Life

- Title: “What it looks like in real life”
- Start with a ✅ hook: ✅ Sometimes you have to fake it—whether that means acting excited for a boring concert or simply moving seats to avoid a negative person.
- Give 2–3 vivid, funny, or surprising examples:
- **Situation Modification (Aunt Tabitha):** If you cannot avoid a stressful family member (like Aunt Tabitha) at Thanksgiving, you can alter the situation by ensuring you are seated far away from her to make the situation more palatable.
- **Behavioral Mimicry (Contagion):** When interacting face-to-face, people unconsciously imitate the postures and mannerisms of others (emotion contagion), and they tend to like the person who copies their gestures.
- **Prosidy (Tone):** Listeners from five different nations could reliably judge differing emotions (e.g., anger, lust, pride) just by listening to the **tone and rhythm of speech** (prosidy) while the speaker said the same, emotionally neutral sentence.
- End with an optional > quote or punchline:

Don’t just watch the face; watch the hands, listen to the voice, and check the seat chart.

🗒 Presenter Notes:

- **Clarify why the examples fit:** The Aunt Tabitha examples illustrate various effective regulation strategies (modification, redirecting attention). The social examples highlight how emotion is expressed (prosidy, mimicry).
- **Ask for student examples:** Discuss a time they used "redirecting attention" (e.g., shifting focus to interesting conversation) to avoid negative feelings in a social setting.
- **Reminder of which example lands best:** The concept of **cognitive reappraisal** (reframing a complaint as an opportunity to practice empathy) is a smart way to regulate emotions.

### Learning Objective 10.4.5: Describe two types of cognition that are relevant to emotions

#### 🎯 Slide 1: LO 10.4.5: Cognition: Appraisals and Attributions

- Use this format: # LO 10.4.5: Cognition: Appraisals and Attributions
- Give 1–2 sentence plain-language definition: Two primary types of **cognition** (thought processes) influence emotion: **appraisals** (how we evaluate the personal meaning of a stimulus) and **attributions** (our explanations about why things happen).
- Add 2–3 key bullets highlighting distinctions:
- **Emotional appraisal** determines the emotional outcome; the same roller coaster can be appraised as a "threat" (leading to fear) or "curiosity" (leading to excitement).
- Appraisals can be **fast and automatic** (e.g., fear response) or **slower and more reflective** (e.g., considering personal meaning).
- **Attributions** change emotional response; a father might feel **anger** if he attributes his daughter's bad behavior to poor temper control, but **sympathy** if he attributes it to being sick.

🗒 Presenter Notes (required):

- **Clarify:** Appraisals are instantaneous personal evaluations (Good/Bad?), while attributions are the search for cause (Why did that happen?).
- **Ask:** If you see a sad movie, your appraisal of the movie is likely "sad," leading to tears. If you see someone cry, and you attribute their tears to grief (internal cause), how might your own emotion be different than if you attributed the crying to an allergic reaction (external cause)?
- **Reminder:** I’ll emphasize the roller coaster example to clearly show how two people can have completely different emotional outcomes from the exact same stimulus, based purely on appraisal.

#### 🎯 Slide 2: What It Looks Like in Real Life

- Title: “What it looks like in real life”
- Start with a ✅ hook: ✅ It’s not the bear itself that scares you, it’s what you decide the bear means to _you_.
- Give 2–3 vivid, funny, or surprising examples:
- **The Roller Coaster Effect:** Jasmeet appraises a giant roller coaster as a threat, feeling fear, while Daisha appraises the exact same coaster as curious, feeling excitement and anticipation.
- **Parental Anger:** Parents typically respond with **anger** if they attribute a child’s misbehavior to internal factors the child can control (like bad temper), but with less anger if they attribute it to external/temporary factors (like being unwell).
- **Impact on Health:** Differing emotional appraisals regarding threats and stress can significantly impact a person's ability to cope, which may ultimately affect their health.
- End with an optional > quote or punchline:

Your emotional response is less about what you see, and more about how you personally score it.

🗒 Presenter Notes:

- **Clarify why the examples fit:** The roller coaster illustrates how appraisal directly changes the emotional outcome (fear vs. excitement). The parental response demonstrates how attribution (internal/controllable vs. external/temporary) dictates the resulting emotion (anger vs. sympathy).
- **Ask for student examples:** Discuss a time they had a highly emotional reaction to a grade or setback, and how changing their attribution (e.g., from "I am stupid" to "I didn't study enough") changed their subsequent emotion.
- **Reminder of which example lands best:** Focus on the attribution difference in the parental example, as it is a clear model for how the _reason_ assigned to an event shapes the feeling.

The section being addressed is **10.5 Connecting the Four Aspects of Emotion: Theories of Emotion**.

### Learning Objective 10.5.1: Outline the similarities and differences between the James-Lange, Cannon-Bard, and Schachter-Singer theories of emotion

#### 🎯 Slide 1: LO 10.5.1: Three Theories of Emotion (Who Came First?)

- Use this format: # LO 10.5.1: Emotion Theories: A Three-Way Race
- Give 1–2 sentence plain-language definition: Three classic theories explain how the components of emotion (experience, physiology, and expression) interact: James-Lange says bodily arousal _causes_ the feeling; Cannon-Bard says arousal and feeling happen _simultaneously_; and Schachter-Singer says arousal must first be _cognitively labeled_ to create the feeling.
- Add 2–3 key bullets highlighting distinctions:
- The **James-Lange theory** reverses common sense: We feel fear _because_ we run and notice our pounding heart, not the other way around.
- The **Cannon-Bard theory** suggests that the thalamus alerts the cortex (for feeling) and the peripheral nervous system (for arousal) at the same time.
- **Schachter-Singer's two-factor theory** adds the crucial element of **cognition** (labeling or interpreting the arousal) to determine the experienced emotion.

🗒 Presenter Notes (required):

- **Clarify:** The main similarity between the James-Lange and Cannon-Bard theories is that they only focused on three components (experience, physiology, and behavior), excluding cognition. The Schachter-Singer theory incorporates cognition through the labeling process (attribution).
- **Ask:** If you felt your heart pounding, how would you decide if that feeling meant you were angry or excited? What information would you need? (Answer: Environmental/situational cues and attributions).
- **Reminder:** I’ll tell the story about driving and swerving to illustrate how we often feel the emotion _after_ the body reacts, supporting the James-Lange theory.

#### 🎯 Slide 2: What It Looks Like in Real Life

- Title: “What it looks like in real life”
- Start with a ✅ hook: ✅ Are you attracted to that person, or are you just 20 stories up on a shaky bridge?
- Give 2–3 vivid, funny, or surprising examples:
- **The Bear Encounter (Common Sense vs. James-Lange):** Common sense suggests seeing a bear leads to fear, then running. James-Lange says seeing the bear leads to running/arousal, and _then_ we feel fear as we become aware of our bodily reactions.
- **The Two-Factor Misattribution (Bridge Study):** Men interviewed by a female psychologist on a swaying suspension bridge (high arousal) were much more likely to call her later than men interviewed on a solid bridge. They **misattributed** their fear-based arousal to attraction.
- **The Adrenaline Movie Test:** People given an arousing injection of adrenaline before watching a slapstick movie rated it funnier and laughed more than those given a tranquilizer. They attributed their general physiological arousal to the movie, labeling the emotion as happiness/amusement.
- End with an optional > quote or punchline:

Arousal alone does not produce emotion; arousal must be labeled or interpreted.

🗒 Presenter Notes:

- **Clarify why the examples fit:** The bridge and adrenaline examples strongly support the Schachter-Singer theory by showing that the _cognitive label_ assigned to general arousal determines the specific emotion experienced (fear/adrenaline $\rightarrow$ love/amusement).
- **Ask for student examples:** Discuss a time they felt highly aroused (e.g., just before a sports competition) and how they cognitively channeled that arousal into excitement rather than panic.
- **Reminder of which example lands best:** The "love at first fright" bridge study is a classic, clear case of **misattribution**.

#### 🎯 Slide 3: What It’s NOT

- Title: “What it’s NOT”
- Use 🚫 bullets with brief explanations:
- 🚫 **The James-Lange theory is not fully supported.** People with high spinal injuries still feel emotion intensely, despite lacking much physiological feedback from their bodies, which contradicts James-Lange.
- 🚫 **The Schachter-Singer theory is not a guaranteed path to the correct feeling.** Misattributions are common, such as when students falsely rated photos as more attractive because they heard a pounding heart, showing that the labeling process can be incorrect.

🗒 Presenter Notes:

- **Clarify what students often get wrong:** Students often struggle with the idea that arousal precedes emotion (James-Lange). Reiterate that the Cannon-Bard theory was created to counter James-Lange by arguing that experience and arousal are simultaneous.
- **Ask a correction or contrast question:** Why does the inability of a polygraph to distinguish between lying and anxiety support the Schachter-Singer theory? (The polygraph detects _general_ physiological arousal [Factor 1], which must be labeled [Factor 2] to become a specific emotion, supporting the idea that arousal is non-specific).
- **Reminder:** Mnemonic: **J**ames-**L**ange: **J**ump **L**ater (feel later). **C**annon-**B**ard: **C**o-**B**last (simultaneous). **S**chachter-**S**inger: **S**top and **S**ee (label the arousal).

### Learning Objective 10.5.2: Explain the central idea that underlies basic emotion theories (BETs), and the strengths and weaknesses of Ekman’s BET

#### 🎯 Slide 1: LO 10.5.2: Basic Emotion Theories (BETs)

- Use this format: # LO 10.5.2: Basic Emotions: The Big Six and Beyond
- Give 1–2 sentence plain-language definition: **Basic emotion theories (BETs)** propose that emotions are brief states that arise after cognitive appraisals and fall into distinct, broad categories, each involving specific expressions, physiology, and behaviors.
- Add 2–3 key bullets highlighting distinctions:
- Pioneering researcher **Paul Ekman** suggested there are six basic emotions, the **“Big Six”**: surprise, happiness, sadness, anger, disgust, and fear.
- Ekman argued that these basic emotions are **universal** across cultures, appear early in infancy (suggesting they are unlearned), and are shared with other mammals.
- A key strength of Ekman's model is that the facial expressions for the Big Six are well recognized around the world, even by children who are born blind.

🗒 Presenter Notes (required):

- **Clarify:** The term "basic" implies they are automatic, fast, and evolutionarily rooted, emerging from cognitive appraisals. This contrasts with more complex emotions that might involve social learning.
- **Ask:** Why would the fact that a monkey baring its teeth looks like an angry human baring its teeth support the idea of basic, unlearned emotions?
- **Reminder:** I’ll remind students that Ekman's work showed that masks of happiness are strikingly similar globally (upward-curved mouth, rising cheeks).

#### 🎯 Slide 2: What It Looks Like in Real Life

- Title: “What it looks like in real life”
- Start with a ✅ hook: ✅ Whether you’re on a remote island or in a major city, some expressions need no translation.
- Give 2–3 vivid, funny, or surprising examples:
- **The Universal Smile:** Facial masks designed to show happiness are strikingly similar across the world (open, upward-curved mouth, rising cheeks), suggesting basic emotional expressions have universal biological roots.
- **Fear Recognition:** People are especially adept at detecting angry and scheming faces faster than happy, sad, or neutral faces, suggesting this ability evolved to rapidly warn us of possible harm.
- **Blind Expression:** Children born blind display basic emotional expressions (the Big Six) in much the same way as sighted people, suggesting these expressions are relatively unlearned.
- End with an optional > quote or punchline:

Your ability to “read” the emotional message of a simple mask suggests that basic emotional expressions have universal biological roots.

🗒 Presenter Notes:

- **Clarify why the examples fit:** The examples of blind children and universal recognition highlight the strongest evidence for BETs: that these emotions are innate and not purely learned.
- **Ask for student examples:** Ask students if they've ever traveled somewhere where they couldn't speak the language but could easily read the emotions of the locals.
- **Reminder of which example lands best:** Focus on the finding about blind children as it directly challenges the idea that all emotional expression is learned by observation.

#### 🎯 Slide 3: What It’s NOT

- Title: “What it’s NOT”
- Use 🚫 bullets with brief explanations:
- 🚫 **Emotions are not just expressed on the face.** Current BETs criticize Ekman's emphasis on the face, noting that expression also occurs through **touch, gaze, posture, and voice**.
- 🚫 **There are not only six basic emotions.** Contemporary researchers suggest there may be as many as **25** states with the properties of emotions, reflecting the complexity of human experience.
- 🚫 **They are not entirely universal.** While similarities exist, more recent work points to important **cultural differences** in emotional expression and appraisal that influence the language we use to describe feelings.

🗒 Presenter Notes:

- **Clarify what students often get wrong:** Students often assume Ekman's Big Six is the definitive list. Clarify that current theories see more complexity, recognizing fuzzy boundaries and the importance of non-facial channels like **prosidy** (vocal tone and rhythm).
- **Ask a correction or contrast question:** If a culture places high value on group harmony, how might that contradict the universality of one of Ekman's "Big Six" emotions, like anger? (Anger, which separates people, would be regulated/suppressed more often than in Western cultures).
- **Reminder:** Mnemonic: BETs have **B**road **E**xpressions (not just faces) and **T**ons of categories (more than six).

The section being addressed is **10.6 Psychology and Your Skill Set: Positivity and Optimism**.

### Learning Objective 10.6.1: Outline what is meant by the terms positive psychology, subjective well-being, and optimism

#### 🎯 Slide 1: LO 10.6.1: Positive Psychology: Focus on the Good

- Use this format: # LO 10.6.1: Positive Psychology: Focus on the Good
- Give 1–2 sentence plain-language definition: **Positive psychology** is the study of human strengths, virtues, and positive emotions, focusing on concepts like **optimism** (seeing the positive side of events) and **subjective well-being** (being generally satisfied with life and experiencing frequent positive emotions).
- Add 2–3 key bullets highlighting distinctions:
- While psychology historically focused on solving human problems (the negative side), **positive psychology** specifically investigates effective functioning and human strengths.
- **Subjective well-being** is achieved when general life satisfaction is combined with frequent positive emotions and relatively few negative emotions.
- **Optimism** is beneficial, but **unrealistic optimism** (refusing to see risks) can be harmful because it prevents people from taking appropriate action to address real problems.

🗒 Presenter Notes (required):

- **Clarify:** Optimism isn't just about feeling good; it's a cognitive skill that helps people actively cope with adversity. Unrealistic optimism is the danger zone where hopeful thinking turns into wishful thinking.
- **Ask:** If someone says they are "lucky," are they showing optimism or unrealistic optimism? How would you decide?
- **Reminder:** I’ll tell the story of Michael J. Fox, who continued to act and started a foundation despite his Parkinson’s diagnosis, showcasing optimism and subjective well-being.

#### 🎯 Slide 2: What It Looks Like in Real Life

- Title: “What it looks like in real life”
- Start with a ✅ hook: ✅ Life events are not as important as how you interpret them.
- Give 2–3 vivid, funny, or surprising examples:
- **The Eternal Optimist:** Michael J. Fox, after being diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease, chose to focus on possibilities and what he could control, maintaining that something of greater value had been given for everything the disease took away.
- **Optimism in Relationships:** Optimists tend to have longer-lasting and more satisfying relationships, and they are less likely to be stressed or anxious compared to pessimists.
- **The Wishful Thinker (Unrealistic Optimism):** People who demonstrate unrealistic optimism might fail to seek early treatment for health concerns because they always expect things to turn out well, allowing their difficulties to worsen.
- End with an optional > quote or punchline:

As Michael J. Fox will tell you, there’s an important line that needs to be drawn between hopeful thinking and wishful thinking.

🗒 Presenter Notes:

- **Clarify why the examples fit:** Michael J. Fox embodies the successful application of an optimistic **explanatory style** in the face of major adversity. The relationship and health examples show the broad, positive impacts of a realistic optimistic attitude.
- **Ask for student examples:** Ask students to identify a recent small setback and discuss how an optimistic person might interpret it versus an unrealistically optimistic person.
- **Reminder of which example lands best:** Focus on the health benefits: Optimists are physically healthier and take better care of themselves because they believe their efforts will succeed.

### Learning Objective 10.6.2: Outline the three elements of explanatory style

#### 🎯 Slide 1: LO 10.6.2: Explanatory Style: Interpreting the Event

- Use this format: # LO 10.6.2: Explanatory Style: Interpreting the Event
- Give 1–2 sentence plain-language definition: **Explanatory style** is the way a person interprets life events (both good and bad), and it has three key components that distinguish optimists from pessimists: permanence, pervasiveness, and personal.
- Add 2–3 key bullets highlighting distinctions:
- **Pervasiveness** asks if the event will impact other aspects of life (Optimist: "This is just one grade"; Pessimist: "My whole life is ruined").
- **Permanence** asks how long the conditions will last (Optimist: "The next exam will be better"; Pessimist: "The next exam will be just as bad").
- **Personal** asks if the event is due to an unchanging personal trait or a changeable circumstance (Optimist: "I didn’t study enough"; Pessimist: "I'm just so stupid").

🗒 Presenter Notes (required):

- **Clarify:** Optimists view negative events as **limited in effects** (low pervasiveness), **short term** (low permanence), and caused by **changeable circumstances** (not personal fault). Pessimists reverse these views, even for positive events.
- **Ask:** If you won the lottery, how would a pessimist interpret the permanence of that event? (Answer: They might think the money will be gone quickly.)
- **Reminder:** I’ll use the example of receiving a poor midterm grade to walk through all three components of an optimistic vs. pessimistic explanation.

#### 🎯 Slide 2: What It Looks Like in Real Life

- Title: “What it looks like in real life”
- Start with a ✅ hook: ✅ Optimists use the three P’s to shield themselves from disaster; pessimists use them to sink themselves further.
- Give 2–3 vivid, funny, or surprising examples:
- **Pessimist on Failure (Personal, Permanent, Pervasive):** A pessimist fails a test and thinks, "I'm stupid" (Personal, unchangeable trait), "I'll fail the whole semester" (Permanent, far-reaching), and "This ruins everything" (Pervasiveness, broad effect).
- **Optimist on Failure (Circumstance, Temporary, Limited):** An optimist fails a test and thinks, "I didn't study enough" (Circumstance, changeable), "I will try harder next time" (Temporary, short-term), and "This is just one grade" (Limited effect).
- **Optimist on Success:** When an optimist does well on an exam, they are likely to think, "I'm on a roll, exam-wise," and "I’m smart enough," seeing positive events as broad and resulting from stable personal aspects.
- End with an optional > quote or punchline:

Henry Ford was right: “Whether you believe you can do a thing or not, you are right.”

🗒 Presenter Notes:

- **Clarify why the examples fit:** The student grade examples provide a direct contrast of how optimistic explanations assign failure to temporary, fixable causes (insufficient effort), while pessimistic ones assign failure to stable, global causes (stupidity).
- **Ask for student examples:** Ask students to identify a recent success they experienced and analyze whether their self-explanation was optimistic or pessimistic using the three P's.
- **Reminder of which example lands best:** Focus on the optimistic failure example, as it provides a practical way for students to apply cognitive restructuring to future setbacks.

### Learning Objective 10.6.3: Create a plan that will allow you to be more positive and optimistic about an issue that you find challenging

#### 🎯 Slide 1: LO 10.6.3: Optimism: A Skill to Be Developed

- Use this format: # LO 10.6.3: Cultivating Resilience and Hope
- Give 1–2 sentence plain-language definition: While some people are naturally dispositionally optimistic, optimism is a skill that can be cultivated and improved through practice, primarily by challenging pessimistic thinking and restructuring one’s explanatory style regarding negative events.
- Add 2–3 key bullets highlighting distinctions:
- One simple technique to increase optimism is to spend five minutes each day imagining your **best possible self**.
- A key step in improving explanatory style is to challenge inaccurate pessimistic beliefs about the causes of events.
- Optimistic people are more likely to **actively cope** with adversity rather than ignore or deny problems, leading to better outcomes in relationships and health.

🗒 Presenter Notes (required):

- **Clarify:** The process involves recognizing a pessimistic thought and then consciously replacing its elements (Personal $\rightarrow$ Circumstance; Permanent $\rightarrow$ Temporary; Pervasive $\rightarrow$ Limited).
- **Ask:** If your explanation style is pessimistic, why is it essential to check your beliefs against the available evidence before accepting them as true? (Answer: Because they are likely inaccurate and limit future effort).
- **Reminder:** I’ll use the advice that "imagining your best possible self" is a scientifically tested technique for boosting feelings of optimism.

#### 🎯 Slide 2: What It Looks Like in Real Life

- Title: “What it looks like in real life”
- Start with a ✅ hook: ✅ Optimism is a skill; like pushups, you get better by doing it, not by thinking about it.
- Give 2–3 vivid, funny, or surprising examples:
- **Challenging Pessimism:** Before accepting that a poor midterm grade is the result of low intelligence, you should look carefully at all available evidence to ensure the belief is accurate, as it likely isn't.
- **Relationship Resilience:** Optimists who experience a relationship setback are less likely to be stymied by it and more likely to tackle the problems head-on, allowing their relationships to last longer.
- **Workplace Success:** Optimists tend to do well in jobs where setbacks are common, as their explanatory style motivates them to renew effort rather than giving up.
- End with an optional > quote or punchline:

Becoming more confident in test-taking helps you remain calm, which is another great reason to practice being positive.

🗒 Presenter Notes:

- **Clarify why the examples fit:** The key message here is that the effort to change explanatory style yields positive, tangible results in different domains (academics, work, relationships).
- **Ask for student examples:** Have students practice turning a previously identified pessimistic thought (e.g., "I am failing") into an optimistic one (e.g., "I need to change my study routine").
- **Reminder of which example lands best:** Emphasize that psychological research has demonstrated that it is possible to change your explanatory style, and it is well worth the effort for health, relationships, and well-being.
