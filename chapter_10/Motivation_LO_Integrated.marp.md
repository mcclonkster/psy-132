# Motivation  
_PS Y 132 — One-Class Overview_

Today we will:
- Replace “motivation = willpower” with a usable model
- Distinguish **drives** from **incentives**
- Survey motive types (biological, stimulus, social/learned)
- Name key frameworks (Maslow; SDT; arousal theory/Yerkes–Dodson; nAch/power; opponent-process)
- Apply the model to everyday choices

<!--
LO coverage: 10.1.1
Presenter notes:
- Tone: motivation is a process, not willpower. Use live examples; no writing required.
- Invite one sentence: “What got you here today?”
-->

## Agenda

1. What motivation means
2. Core chain: **Need → Drive → Response → Goal**
3. Push vs pull: drives and incentives
4. Motive types: biological, stimulus, social (integrated picture)
5. Maslow; SDT (quality of motivation)
6. Arousal theory (Yerkes–Dodson); nAch; power; opponent-process
7. Quick biologicals: sex; circadian sleep; pain
8. Goals, expectancy–value, and IF–THEN
9. Quick cases; misconceptions; oral check

<!--
Application (inference; no Chapter 10 LO).
Notes: roadmap only; emphasize understanding over coverage.

## What motivation is (and isn’t)

**Motivation** energizes, **directs**, and **sustains** behavior.
It is not just “wanting it more.”

<!--
LO coverage: 10.1.1
Notes: Use a concrete example contrasting starting vs staying engaged.
-->

---

## Core chain

**Need → Drive → Response → Goal**

- Need: deficit or desired state
- Drive: internal push (hunger, fatigue, curiosity)
- Response: behavior chosen
- Goal: reduces need or satisfies value

<!--
LO coverage: 10.1.1
Notes: Draw four boxes; map a student example. Descriptive, not moral.
-->

---

## Push vs Pull

- **Drives (push):** internal states pressuring action
- **Incentives (pull):** external outcomes attracting action
- Most behaviors mix both

<!--
LO coverage: 10.1.1
Notes: Classify two live examples together; restate if confusion persists.
-->

---

## Motive types

- Biological
- Stimulus
- Social/Learned

<!--
LO coverage: 10.1.4
Notes: Keep brisk; examples follow.
-->

---

## Motive classes in one picture

- Biological (survival/homeostasis)
- Stimulus (curiosity, play)
- Social/Learned (achievement, affiliation, power, autonomy)
- Expect mixing in real behavior

<!--
LO coverage: 10.1.4
Notes: Label 2–3 student examples; many acts combine push and pull across classes.
-->

---

## Maslow: basic vs growth needs

- **Basic (deficiency):** physiological, safety, belonging, esteem
- **Growth (being):** self-actualization (and beyond)
- Order can flex with context/culture

<!--
LO coverage: 10.1.3
Notes: Use as lens, not ladder; note counterexamples (fasting for values, altruistic risk).
-->

---

## Biological example: hunger

Need: energy deficit → Drive: hunger → Response: eat → Goal: restore balance  
Cues (smells, time) can amplify approach even with weak need.

<!--
LO coverage: 10.1.4
Notes: Ask: “Drive or incentive — free pizza after lunch?”
-->

---

## Biological motives: sex, sleep, pain

- **Sex drive:** hormones modulate desire; context and learning shape expression
- **Circadian sleep:** internal clock; shifts/all-nighters disrupt performance
- **Pain (episodic):** avoidance; responses shaped by learning/culture

<!--
LO coverage: 10.2.1, 10.2.2, 10.2.3
Notes: Clinical tone; one sentence each, then move on.
-->

---

## Stimulus example: curiosity

Seek optimal stimulation or information.  
Helps in small doses; too much novelty fragments attention.

<!--
LO coverage: 10.1.4
Notes: Ask when curiosity helps vs derails study.
-->

---

## Social example: achievement/approval

- Achievement: progress, mastery, standards
- Approval/affiliation: belonging, recognition

<!--
LO coverage: 10.1.4
Notes: Example: polishing a project despite fatigue (drive vs incentive conflict).
-->

---

## Learned motives: nAch and power

- **nAch:** moderate challenge + diagnostic feedback
- **Power:** preference for influence/impact (prosocial or personal expressions)

<!--
LO coverage: 10.3.3
Notes: Diagnostic tell: too-easy (avoid failure info) vs too-hard (ego defense). nAch tends toward the middle.
-->

---

## Intrinsic vs extrinsic

- **Intrinsic:** activity itself is satisfying
- **Extrinsic:** separable outcome (money, points, praise)
- Both useful; different time profiles

<!--
LO coverage: 10.1.2
Notes: Nuance: intrinsic often durable; extrinsic bootstraps dull tasks.
-->

---

## Intrinsic vs extrinsic with SDT

Quality improves when **autonomy**, **competence**, **relatedness** are supported.  
Use **informational** feedback; avoid controlling language.

<!--
LO coverage: 10.1.2
Notes: Autonomy ≠ abandonment; it is choice within structure. Contrast “do it or else” vs “here’s what improved.”
-->

---

## Arousal theory and Yerkes–Dodson

- Seek optimal arousal; performance often inverted‑U
- **Moderator:** task difficulty/novelty
- Easy tolerates higher arousal; complex requires lower peak

<!--
LO coverage: 10.3.1, 10.3.2
Notes: Moderated pattern, not a universal law; example: proofs vs laundry.
-->

---

## Opposing forces: Opponent‑process theory

Strong reactions → opposite process grows with repetition.  
Initial “A” weakens; opposite “B” strengthens.  
Examples: thrill seeking, after-effects, tolerance.

<!--
LO coverage: 10.3.4
Notes: Motivation–emotion bridge; keep examples sober (spicy food, morning exercise).
-->

---

## Goals and feedback

- Specific, meaningful goals focus attention
- Feedback shows progress and guides adjustment
- Vague goals scatter attention

<!--
Application (inference; no Chapter 10 LO)
Notes: Refactor a vague goal aloud.
-->

---

## Expectancy × Value

We act when **can I?** and **is it worth it?** are both reasonable.  
Raise expectancy: shrink next step; modeling; scaffolding.  
Raise value: near goals; meaning; consequences.

<!--
Application (inference; no Chapter 10 LO)
Notes: Ask which lever helps tonight.
-->

---

## From goals to action

**Implementation intention:** “If [cue], then I will [tiny action].”  
Example: “If it’s 7:00 pm, then I open notes and read one page.”

<!--
Application (inference; no Chapter 10 LO)
Notes: Links cue to action; lowers start friction.
-->

---

## Consequences and persistence

- Reinforcement increases behavior; punishment decreases
- Variable schedules often yield persistence

<!--
Application (inference; no Chapter 10 LO)
Notes: Practical takeaway: small, unpredictable wins can maintain effort.
-->

---

## Wanting vs Liking

- **Wanting** (incentive salience) can persist without liking
- Change cues and first steps, not just “willpower”

<!--
Application (inference; no Chapter 10 LO)
Notes: Phone checking example; ask for a quick nodding example.
-->

---

## Quick cases

- Show‑up behavior: drives (fatigue/hunger) + incentives (points/belonging) → shrink step; IF–THEN
- Phone habit: variable “hits” → move cue; tiny start; near value

<!--
LO coverage: 10.1.1, 10.1.4
Notes: Identify one driver, one incentive, one plan tweak per case.
-->

---

## Misconceptions

- “Motivation is willpower” → behavior is overdetermined
- “Rewards always help” → can bootstrap or backfire
- “No motivation, no action” → plans can lower start cost

<!--
Application (inference; no Chapter 10 LO)
Notes: Gentle corrections; keep it usable.
-->

---

## Oral check

- Contrast a **drive** and an **incentive** using your own example
- Run **Need → Drive → Response → Goal** for something you did

<!--
LO coverage: 10.1.1, 10.1.4
Notes: Two voices; keep pace.
-->

---

## Why this matters

- Explains why starting is hard and how to lower friction
- Shows how cues and small wins sustain effort
- Helps pick strategies that fit pushes and pulls

<!--
Application (inference; no Chapter 10 LO)
Notes: Bridge to Emotion: meaning steers action.
-->
