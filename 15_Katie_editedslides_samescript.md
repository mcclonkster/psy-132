# Therapies

- Instructor: Kathryn Bangs, PhD, LCP, NCSP, PEL, LPHA

::: notes
Welcome to the chapter on Therapies. In this lecture, we’ll explore how psychological and medical approaches are used to treat mental health concerns. We’ll cover the history of treatment, major therapeutic models — including behavior, cognitive, and humanistic approaches — and medical therapies such as medication and brain stimulation. Throughout the chapter, we’ll also discuss the core components that make therapy effective and the coping skills clients can develop to manage their mental health more effectively.

# History of Therapy

- Early approaches included trepanning, exorcism, and long-term confinement.
- In 1793, Philippe Pinel introduced **moral treatment**, emphasizing humane care.
- Freud later launched psychoanalysis as the first structured “talking cure.”

::: notes
Historically, people explained mental illness through supernatural or spiritual causes. This led to practices such as trepanning, exorcism, and long-term confinement.

A major shift occurred in 1793 when Philippe Pinel advocated for humane care, launching moral treatment. Later, Freud introduced the first structured “talking cure,” psychoanalysis, which centered on unconscious motives and internal conflicts. This marked the beginning of modern psychotherapy and set the stage for today’s psychological and medical models.

# Freud’s Psychoanalysis

- Goal: uncover and resolve unconscious conflicts.
- Uses **free association** to explore thoughts without censorship.
- Uses **dream analysis** to interpret hidden meanings.
- Watches for **resistance** (avoidance of important topics).
- Watches for **transference** (feelings toward therapist that echo other relationships).

::: notes
Freud believed that unconscious conflicts shape our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors, and that bringing these conflicts into awareness helps people heal — a process called insight.

Psychoanalysis includes several techniques:
- **Free association**, where clients say whatever comes to mind to bypass conscious filters.
- **Dream analysis**, viewing dreams as symbolic windows into the unconscious.
- **Resistance**, when clients avoid painful material.
- **Transference**, where clients project feelings toward past figures onto the therapist.

You can use examples such as clients reenacting parental relationships during transference — a clue to unresolved emotional patterns.

# Key Dimensions of Psychotherapy

- **Insight vs. action:** focus on understanding vs. changing behavior.
- **Directive vs. nondirective:** therapist leads vs. client leads.
- **Individual vs. group:** one-on-one vs. multiple clients together.
- **Face-to-face vs. distance:** in-person vs. online or phone-based.

::: notes
There are four major dimensions that describe different therapies.

**Insight vs. Action:** Insight therapies focus on deep understanding, while action therapies emphasize directly changing behavior.  
**Directive vs. Nondirective:** In directive therapies like CBT, the therapist takes an active role. In nondirective therapies like Rogerian therapy, the client guides the process.  
**Individual vs. Group:** Clients may receive therapy one-on-one or in groups that offer social learning and support.  
**Face-to-face vs. Distance:** Teletherapy expanded significantly and is widely used.

You can connect specific examples: CBT is action and directive; client-centered therapy is insight and nondirective; group therapy supports shared learning; teletherapy has grown significantly.

# What Makes Psychotherapy Effective?

- A strong **therapeutic alliance** (trusting, collaborative relationship).
- A **safe, protected setting** where clients can speak honestly.
- A believable **explanation** for distress.
- **New perspectives and skills** that clients can apply in daily life.

::: notes
Across all therapy models, research identifies several universal components that predict success. A strong therapeutic alliance built on trust and cooperation is essential. A safe, supportive environment encourages clients to discuss concerns openly.

Therapy also requires an explanation for the client’s distress that feels meaningful, paired with opportunities to develop new skills or perspectives. Many therapeutic gains come from this combination of understanding, practice, and supportive connection, regardless of the specific model being used.

# Cultural Competence in Therapy

To be a culturally skilled therapist, one must:

- Adapt methods to fit the client’s cultural context.
- Recognize and reflect on personal biases.
- Understand the client’s cultural identity and level of acculturation.
- Use community and cultural resources when helpful.

::: notes
Culturally competent therapists understand how identity, cultural background, and values shape a client’s experience. This includes knowing how factors such as acculturation, worldview, communication style, and community influences impact mental health.

Effective therapists adapt their methods to each client, reflect on their own biases, and use culturally relevant resources such as spiritual leaders or community supports. Cultural competence ensures that therapy honors the client’s identity and provides care that feels respectful and relevant.

# Does Psychotherapy Work?

- Early debate: Eysenck argued therapy was no better than time alone.
- Current evidence supports the effectiveness of psychotherapy.
- Placebo effects and spontaneous remission do occur.
- The most effective approaches are **empirically supported treatments**.

::: notes
Early debates questioned whether psychotherapy was effective. Eysenck famously argued that therapy produced no better outcomes than time alone. However, decades of research show the opposite: psychotherapy is highly effective for many conditions.

Expectancy and placebo effects do contribute to improvement, but empirically supported treatments — such as CBT for depression and exposure therapy for anxiety — show strong and consistent benefits. Therapy works best when it is matched to a client’s needs, preferences, and cultural background.

# Behavior Therapy Overview

- Behavior therapy focuses on observable behavior change.
- It uses principles of learning (classical and operant conditioning).
- Deep insight into the past is not required for change.

::: notes
Behavior therapy is grounded in learning theory and focuses on observable actions rather than unconscious motives. It uses learning principles to make constructive changes in behavior.

This method is especially helpful for problems involving learned responses, such as phobias, compulsions, or habits. Because insight into the past is not required, progress can be rapid. You can reference examples like reducing tantrums by changing reinforcement patterns.
:::

---

# Classical Conditioning–Based Therapies

- **Aversion therapy:** pair an unwanted behavior with an unpleasant stimulus.
- **Systematic desensitization:** gradually pair relaxation with feared situations.
- **Exposure therapies:** help clients face feared situations directly  
  (e.g., flooding, modeling, virtual reality).

::: notes
Classical conditioning approaches help clients unlearn emotional responses that have become maladaptive.

**Aversion therapy** pairs a harmful behavior with discomfort to reduce its appeal.  
**Systematic desensitization** gradually exposes clients to feared situations while they remain relaxed.  
**Exposure therapy** confronts fear more directly; virtual reality exposure is now used for conditions like PTSD.

All of these techniques work by creating new associations that weaken old fear responses.
:::

---

# Operant Conditioning–Based Therapies

- **Reinforcement:** increase desired behaviors with rewards.
- **Extinction:** reduce behaviors by removing reinforcement.
- **Shaping:** build new behaviors through small steps and reinforcement.
- **Time-out:** briefly remove access to reinforcement after misbehavior.
- **Token economies:** give tokens for desired behaviors that can be exchanged for rewards.

::: notes
Operant conditioning therapies use consequences to shape behavior.

**Reinforcement** increases desired behaviors.  
**Extinction** reduces behaviors by removing reinforcement.  
**Shaping** builds new behaviors gradually through small, reinforced steps — for example, in intensive behavioral interventions for autism.  
**Time-out** temporarily removes access to reinforcement.  
**Token economies** reward adaptive behaviors with tokens that can be exchanged for privileges.

These methods are structured, measurable, and effective for building practical skills.

# Cognitive Therapies

- Goal: change maladaptive thought patterns.
- Target **cognitive distortions**, such as:
  - **Selective perception:** noticing only evidence that fits one belief.
  - **Overgeneralization:** making broad conclusions from one event.
  - **All-or-nothing thinking:** seeing things as all good or all bad.

::: notes
Cognitive therapies help clients identify and change distorted thought patterns that create emotional distress.

Common distortions include:
- **Selective perception:** focusing only on negative details.
- **Overgeneralization:** drawing broad conclusions from one event.
- **All-or-nothing thinking:** seeing things in extremes.

For example, “I missed one assignment — I’m failing everything.” The goal is to challenge these thoughts and replace them with more realistic interpretations.
:::

# Cognitive-Behavior Therapy (CBT)

- CBT combines cognitive techniques with behavioral strategies.
- **ABC Model (Ellis):**
  - A = Activating event
  - B = Beliefs about the event
  - C = Emotional and behavioral Consequences
- Teaches skills like **thought stopping** to interrupt unhelpful thinking.

::: notes
CBT blends cognitive restructuring with behavior change. The Ellis ABC model explains that emotional and behavioral consequences (C) stem from beliefs (B) about an activating event (A), not the event itself.

For example, two people may receive identical feedback but interpret it differently based on their beliefs, leading to different emotional reactions. CBT helps clients identify maladaptive beliefs, test them, and adopt more effective behaviors. Techniques like thought stopping interrupt repetitive negative thinking. CBT is one of the most well-researched and effective therapies for depression, anxiety, and related disorders.

# Humanistic Therapies

- **Client-centered therapy (Rogers):**
  - Unconditional positive regard
  - Empathy
  - Authenticity
  - Reflection
- **Gestalt therapy** emphasizes awareness and “here-and-now” experience.
- **Existential therapy** focuses on choice, meaning, and responsibility.

::: notes
Humanistic therapies emphasize personal growth, free will, and the client’s subjective experience.

Rogerian, or client-centered, therapy uses:
- **Unconditional positive regard**
- **Empathy**
- **Authenticity**
- **Reflective listening**

This creates a safe, accepting environment for self-exploration.

Gestalt therapy focuses on the present moment and taking responsibility for one’s choices. Existential therapy encourages people to confront meaning, freedom, and responsibility — themes central to a fulfilling life. These approaches promote holistic, person-centered growth.

# Medical Therapies

- **Drug categories:**
  - Antipsychotic medications
  - Antianxiety medications
  - Antidepressants
  - Mood stabilizers
  - Stimulants
- **Brain stimulation treatments:**
  - Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)
  - Deep brain stimulation
  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)

::: notes
Many psychological disorders have biological components, and medical therapies address these directly.

Medication classes include:
- **Antipsychotics** for hallucinations and delusions.
- **Antidepressants** for mood disorders.
- **Antianxiety medications** for tension and panic.
- **Mood stabilizers** for bipolar disorder.
- **Stimulants** for ADHD.

Brain-based treatments include ECT, deep brain stimulation, and TMS. Each treatment carries benefits and risks and requires careful monitoring. Selecting the right drug and dosage can be challenging and often involves trial and error.

# Hospitalization and Community Mental Health

- Hospitalization may be used for crisis stabilization, diagnosis, and safety.
- **Partial hospitalization** programs provide structured daytime treatment.
- **Deinstitutionalization** shifted care from hospitals to communities.
- **Halfway houses** offer supervised living for people transitioning to independence.
- **Community mental health programs** and prevention efforts support ongoing care.

::: notes
Hospitalization is used for crisis stabilization, safety concerns, or intensive assessment. Partial hospitalization provides structured treatment without overnight stays.

Deinstitutionalization shifted care from long-term institutions to community settings. This worked well when adequate community supports were provided, but created gaps when resources were lacking.

Community mental health centers, prevention programs, crisis services, and halfway houses are all important in maintaining long-term stability and recovery.
:::

# Basic Counseling Skills

- Use **active listening** to show attention and understanding.
- Use **reflection** to feed key ideas and feelings back to the client.
- Ask **open-ended questions** to invite deeper responses.
- Help clients **clarify problems** in their own words.
- Avoid giving direct advice or telling clients what to do.
- Maintain confidentiality within legal and ethical limits.

::: notes
These foundational skills help people support others without acting as therapists.

**Active listening** communicates attention and care.  
**Reflection** helps clients hear their own thoughts with clarity.  
**Open-ended questions** encourage exploration.  
**Clarification** ensures accuracy.

You should remind students that these skills are not a license to “do therapy”; instead, they are ways to build supportive connections and guide peers toward appropriate resources. Confidentiality is essential, within legal and ethical boundaries.

# Finding a Therapist

- Possible starting points:
  - Primary care providers
  - Universities
  - Community centers
  - Hotlines
  - Mental health associations
- Consider a therapist’s **qualifications**, training, and experience.
- Pay attention to the **therapeutic alliance** (fit, comfort, trust).

::: notes
Students often ask where therapy begins. Common entry points include primary care providers, university counseling centers, community mental health agencies, hotlines, and national organizations.

It is important to evaluate therapist qualifications and find someone with whom the client feels understood and respected. The therapeutic alliance is one of the strongest predictors of success. Encourage students (and clients) to advocate for themselves and seek a good fit.

# Summary: Modern Therapy

- Psychotherapy has evolved from early primitive treatments to evidence-based models.
- Behavioral, cognitive, and humanistic therapies offer different pathways to change.
- Medical therapies and community programs can support recovery.
- Effective help requires clinician skills, adequate resources, and cultural sensitivity.

::: notes
Psychotherapy has evolved dramatically from early mystical and punitive treatments to evidence-based, scientifically grounded approaches. Behavior, cognitive, humanistic, and medical therapies each offer unique avenues for healing.

Community programs, coping skills, and cultural sensitivity support long-term mental health.

The key takeaway is that effective treatment integrates understanding, skill-building, biological support when needed, and a strong therapeutic relationship grounded in cultural awareness.
