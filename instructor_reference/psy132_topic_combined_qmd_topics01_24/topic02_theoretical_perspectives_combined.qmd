## What this topic covers

- Perspectives are lenses for explaining behavior and mental processes
- Different lenses emphasize different causes and evidence
- You can use more than one lens for the same behavior

::: notes
Visual cue: Same behavior in the center with multiple labeled lenses around it.
:::

## A perspective is an explanatory lens

- It highlights certain causes
- It guides what you measure
- It shapes what you conclude

::: notes
Teaching move: Ask, “What would this lens make you look for first?”
:::

## Lens workflow

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
L[Lens] --> Q[Question]
Q --> P[Prediction]
P --> E[Evidence]
E --> C[Conclusion limits]
```

::: notes
Caption cue: A lens is useful when it generates testable predictions and clear limits.
:::

## What lenses differ on

:::: columns
::: column
Emphasis
- Causes they highlight
- Processes they focus on
:::

::: column
Evidence
- Measures they trust most
- Designs they prefer
:::

::: column
Questions
- What they treat as the main “why”
- What they treat as noise
:::
::::

::: notes
Visual cue: Three-column organizer shown as a stable template you reuse across the topic.
:::

## Use lenses with discipline

- Name the question you are answering
- Say what evidence would support the lens
- Say what evidence would weaken the lens

::: notes
Teaching move: require a “what would change my mind” statement in class discussion.
:::

## Lenses can complement each other

- One behavior can have multiple causes
- Different levels can fit together
- Integration can be stronger than one-lens answers

::: notes
Visual cue: Stacked levels labeled biological, cognitive, behavioral, social and cultural.
:::

## Biological lens asks “what is happening in the body”

- Focus: brain, body, physiology
- Typical why: vulnerability and regulation systems
- Evidence: biological measures and brain-behavior links

::: notes
Visual cue: Brain-body network diagram.
Guardrail: avoid one-region “center” language.
:::

## Behavioral lens asks “what was learned”

- Focus: observable behavior
- Typical why: learning history and consequences
- Evidence: behavior changes with conditioning and reinforcement patterns

::: notes
Visual cue: Antecedent → behavior → consequence loop.
:::

## Cognitive lens asks “how is this interpreted”

- Focus: attention, memory, beliefs, interpretation
- Typical why: meaning and information processing
- Evidence: performance patterns and predictable thinking effects

::: notes
Visual cue: Input → interpretation → response.
:::

## Psychodynamic lens asks “what is outside awareness”

- Focus: motives outside awareness and conflict
- Typical why: recurring themes and internal conflict
- Evidence: patterns across time and relationships

::: notes
Visual cue: Repeating theme across situations.
Guardrail: emphasize inference and limits of evidence.
:::

## Humanistic lens asks “what is meaningful”

- Focus: meaning, values, self-concept
- Typical why: goals and growth needs
- Evidence: lived experience and well-being outcomes

::: notes
Visual cue: Values → choices → growth path.
Guardrail: keep examples concrete, not slogan-based.
:::

## Sociocultural lens asks “what is the context doing”

- Focus: norms, roles, relationships, culture
- Typical why: expectations and constraints in context
- Evidence: group patterns and cultural comparisons

::: notes
Visual cue: Person inside a context frame labeled norms, roles, culture.
:::

## Evolutionary lens asks “what problem does this solve”

- Focus: adaptation over generations
- Typical why: functional problems and trade-offs
- Evidence: testable predictions and converging data

::: notes
Visual cue: Problem → predicted tendency → evidence check.
Guardrail: avoid storytelling that cannot be tested.
:::

## Worked example: phobia through three lenses

Example: fear of dogs

:::: columns
::: column
Biological
- vulnerability and arousal systems
- sensitivity to threat cues
:::

::: column
Behavioral
- learning history
- avoidance reinforced over time
:::

::: column
Cognitive
- threat interpretation
- attention to danger cues
:::
::::

::: notes
Teaching move: ask, “What evidence would be strongest for each lens?”
:::

## Worked example: health behavior through three lenses

Example: sticking to an exercise plan

:::: columns
::: column
Behavioral
- cues and rewards
- habit loops
:::

::: column
Cognitive
- self-efficacy and planning
- beliefs about control
:::

::: column
Sociocultural
- norms and support
- access and constraints
:::
::::

::: notes
Teaching move: ask students to propose one intervention per lens.
:::

## Misconception reset

- A lens is not a topic unit
- A lens is not a moral judgment
- A lens does not claim one cause explains everything

::: notes
Visual cue: “Lens” stamped as a tool, not a label for a person.
:::

## Quick check: match the question to the lens

- Which consequence is maintaining the behavior
- Which beliefs are driving the interpretation
- Which brain or body system is involved
- Which norms and roles shape what is acceptable
- Which goals and values give the choice meaning
- Which motives may be outside awareness
- Which adaptive problem might this tendency address

::: notes
Delivery: students match first, then you reveal.

Prompt: ask what evidence would strengthen the match.
:::

## Quick check answers

- Consequence maintaining behavior → Behavioral
- Beliefs driving interpretation → Cognitive
- Brain or body system involved → Biological
- Norms and roles shaping behavior → Sociocultural
- Goals and values giving meaning → Humanistic
- Motives outside awareness → Psychodynamic
- Adaptive problem framing → Evolutionary

::: notes
Keep each explanation to one discriminating cue.
:::

## Bridge to Topic 3

- Lenses suggest hypotheses
- Research methods test hypotheses
- Next: how designs limit conclusions

::: notes
Visual cue: Lens → hypothesis → method filter → conclusion strength.
