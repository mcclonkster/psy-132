## What this topic covers

- Why goal-oriented behavior starts, persists, and stops
- How needs, incentives, and goals shape action
- How self-efficacy and self-regulation support long-term behavior

::: notes
Visual cue: Start → direction → persistence arrows pointing toward a goal.
:::

## Motivation is inferred from behavior

- Motivation is not directly observed
- We infer motivation from choice, effort, and persistence
- Context shapes what effort looks like

::: notes
Visual cue: Choice, effort, persistence feeding into an inference box labeled motivation.
:::

## Needs, incentives, and goals

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
N[Needs] --> B[Behavior]
I[Incentives] --> B
G[Goals] --> B
B --> O[Outcomes]
O --> G
```

::: notes
Caption cue: needs and incentives both influence behavior, and goals organize behavior over time.
:::

## Needs and homeostasis

- Needs reflect internal states
- Homeostasis supports regulation
- Needs interact with learning and environment

::: notes
Guardrail: needs do not explain all motivation by themselves.
Visual cue: Need meter plus a separate “cues and learning” lane.
:::

## Incentives and reinforcement

- Incentives pull behavior toward outcomes
- Reinforcement shapes behavior through consequences
- Incentives depend on meaning and context

::: notes
Visual cue: Incentive cue in the environment pulling action.
:::

## Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation

:::: columns
::: column
Intrinsic
- interest and enjoyment
- engagement for its own sake
:::

::: column
Extrinsic
- external outcomes
- rewards, grades, approval
:::
::::

::: notes
Guardrail: extrinsic motivation is not automatically harmful.
Visual cue: Two fuel sources feeding into the same behavior.
:::

## When rewards help or hurt

- Rewards can increase behavior short term
- Rewards can undermine intrinsic interest in some conditions
- Effects depend on whether rewards feel controlling

::: notes
Visual cue: Reward labeled informational vs controlling leading to different engagement.
:::

## Self-determination theory

- Autonomy supports engagement
- Competence supports persistence
- Relatedness supports sustained motivation

::: notes
Visual cue: Three supports under a platform labeled engagement.
Anchor: Deci and Ryan.
:::

## Expectancy and self-efficacy

- Expectancies shape effort
- Self-efficacy shapes persistence after setbacks
- Self-efficacy is task-specific

::: notes
Visual cue: “Can I do this task” gauge influencing persistence.
Anchor: Bandura.
:::

## Approach and avoidance motivation

- Approach pursues desired outcomes
- Avoidance prevents negative outcomes
- Both can sustain effort

::: notes
Visual cue: Two paths: toward reward and away from threat.
:::

## Arousal and performance

- Arousal can support simple tasks
- High arousal can impair complex tasks
- Task demands and skill level matter

::: notes
Visual cue: Two curves: simple task peak later, complex task peak earlier.
Guardrail: not a universal law for all tasks and people.
:::

## Goal setting

- Goals direct attention and effort
- Specific goals support tracking progress
- Goals work best with feedback

::: notes
Visual cue: Goal target with a progress bar and a feedback arrow.
:::

## Self-regulation loop

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
P[Plan] --> M[Monitor]
M --> A[Adjust]
A --> P
```

::: notes
Caption cue: self-regulation is repeated planning, monitoring, and adjustment over time.
:::

## Self-control is context-sensitive

- Barriers and constraints matter
- Habits reduce effort cost
- Supports and systems improve persistence

::: notes
Guardrail: avoid framing self-control as pure willpower.
Visual cue: Context constraints around a “choice” box.
:::

## Incentive salience

- Cues can trigger strong wanting
- Wanting can exceed expected pleasure
- Cue effects are learned and context-dependent

::: notes
Visual cue: Cue → wanting spike → approach behavior.
:::

## Worked example: studying for an exam

- Needs: sleep and stress shape capacity
- Incentives: grades and approval shape urgency
- Goals: specific study plan increases follow-through
- Self-efficacy: confidence supports persistence after setbacks

::: notes
Teaching move: ask students to name one change that increases autonomy, competence, or relatedness for studying.
:::

## Common confusions to avoid

- Motivation is the same as emotion
- Rewards always help or always hurt
- Self-efficacy is global confidence
- Self-control is only willpower

::: notes
Use as a reset before retrieval.

:::

## Quick check answers

- Need: internal state that can drive action
- Incentive: external outcome that pulls behavior
- Intrinsic motivation: engagement for interest and enjoyment
- Extrinsic motivation: engagement for external outcomes
- Self-efficacy: task-specific belief about capability
- Autonomy: sense of choice and ownership
- Competence: sense of effectiveness and skill
- Relatedness: sense of connection and belonging
- Goal setting: using goals to direct effort and track progress
- Self-regulation: planning, monitoring, adjusting over time
- Approach motivation: moving toward desired outcomes
- Avoidance motivation: moving away from negative outcomes

::: notes
Keep it brief. Do not re-lecture.

- Emotion adds appraisal and subjective experience
- Next: components of emotion and regulation
