## What this topic covers

- How culture and context shape psychology
- Why generalization can fail across groups and settings
- How measurement and sampling bias distort conclusions
- Identity, acculturation, and stereotype threat

::: notes
Visual cue: One behavior in the center with context layers: norms, values, language, identity, setting.
:::

## Culture changes meaning

- Norms shape what counts as appropriate
- Values shape goals and priorities
- Context changes what behavior communicates

::: notes
Guardrail: avoid cultural essentialism and stereotypes.
:::

## Generalization checkpoint

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
S[Study sample] --> M[Measure and method]
M --> F[Finding]
F --> G{Generalize?}
G -->|Yes, with evidence| P[Population and context match]
G -->|No or limited| L[Limits and caution]
```

::: notes
Caption cue: generalization requires evidence about sampling and measurement, not assumption.
:::

## Within-group variability

- People within groups vary widely
- Group averages do not describe individuals
- Context often explains more than labels

::: notes
Visual cue: One group label with many diverse points inside it.
:::

## Ethnocentrism

- Judging other contexts by your own standards
- Increases misunderstanding
- Can distort research interpretation

::: notes
Visual cue: “default lens” warping interpretation.
:::

## Sampling bias

- Convenience samples are common
- Narrow samples can misestimate typicality
- Sampling limits must be stated

::: notes
Visual cue: Funnel showing who is included and who is missing.
Guardrail: avoid treating overrepresented samples as universal.
:::

## Measurement bias

- Measures can embed assumptions
- Translation can change meaning
- Validation in context improves fairness

::: notes
Visual cue: Same survey item interpreted differently across contexts.
:::

## Cultural competence is concrete skill

- Assess in context
- Communicate clearly
- Adapt when needed

::: notes
Visual cue: Three-step skills checklist.
Guardrail: competence is not only attitude.
:::

## Self-construal

- Independent: autonomy-focused self
- Interdependent: relationship-focused self
- Patterns are context-dependent

::: notes
Visual cue: “me” centered vs “we” network-centered representations.
:::

## Acculturation

- Adaptation in a new cultural context
- Outcomes depend on support and barriers
- Identity processes affect well-being

::: notes
Visual cue: Context shift arrow plus supports and barriers icons.
Anchor: Berry’s acculturation framework.
:::

## Acculturation strategies

```{mermaid}
quadrantChart
title Acculturation strategy patterns
x-axis Low engagement with host culture --> High engagement with host culture
y-axis Low maintenance of heritage culture --> High maintenance of heritage culture
quadrant-1 Integration
quadrant-2 Assimilation
quadrant-3 Marginalization
quadrant-4 Separation
```

::: notes
Guardrail: strategies are shaped by context and constraints, not only preference.
:::

## Cultural identity can be protective

- Belonging and meaning can reduce stress
- Identity can support coping and support-seeking
- Context and safety shape effects

::: notes
Visual cue: Identity badge connecting to support network or to stressors depending on setting.
:::

## Stereotype threat

- Context cues can affect performance
- Effects depend on stakes and identity relevance
- Changing cues can reduce threat

::: notes
Visual cue: Cue → load → performance.
Guardrail: keep claims conditional and context-based.
:::

## Structural barriers and disparities

- Access and affordability shape care
- Language access and trust shape use
- Conditions shape outcomes beyond attitudes

::: notes
Visual cue: Barriers pipeline reducing entry to care.
Guardrail: disparities are not explained by one factor.
:::

## Worked example: measure mismatch

Scenario: a stress scale item asks about “control”

- Meaning of control can differ by context
- Translation can change the nuance
- Validation requires local evidence

::: notes
Teaching move: ask students to propose a revised item that fits the local context.
:::

## Common confusions to avoid

- Culture only matters in “special cases”
- Group averages describe individuals
- One study generalizes everywhere
- Differences imply deficits

::: notes
Use as a reset before retrieval.

:::

## Quick check answers

- Ethnocentrism: judging other cultures by your own standards
- Within-group variability: wide differences within the same group label
- Sampling bias: sample does not represent the population
- Measurement bias: measure embeds assumptions or changes meaning across contexts
- Cultural competence: assess, communicate, adapt skills
- Self-construal: independent versus interdependent self patterns
- Acculturation: adaptation to a new cultural context
- Integration: maintain heritage and engage host culture
- Assimilation: engage host culture with reduced heritage maintenance
- Separation: maintain heritage with low host engagement
- Marginalization: low engagement with both in some contexts
- Stereotype threat: performance affected by stereotype-relevant cues

::: notes
Keep it brief. Do not re-lecture.

## Bridge to Topic 23

- Culture shapes distress expression and help-seeking
- Diagnosis must be interpreted in context
- Next: abnormal psychology and classification limits
