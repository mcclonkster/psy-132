## What this topic covers

- What counts as psychological disorder
- How diagnosis and classification work, with limits
- Multi-factor risk models and cultural context
- Stigma and barriers to care

::: notes
Visual cue: Classification + context + outcomes triangle.
:::

## Disorder is evaluated in context

- Patterns of emotion, cognition, and behavior
- Associated with distress or impairment
- Interpreted in cultural and situational context

::: notes
Guardrail: distress and impairment are related but not identical.
:::

C --> R[Rule-outs and alternatives]
R --> L[Provisional label]
L --> P[Plan and supports]
```

::: notes
Caption cue: diagnosis supports communication and planning, not automatic explanation.
:::

## Diagnosis is descriptive

- Supports shared language
- Supports treatment planning
- Does not automatically identify cause

::: notes
Guardrail: categories are not causes.
:::

## Key classification terms

- Comorbidity
- Heterogeneity
- Differential diagnosis

::: notes
Visual cue: Three cards with one discriminating phrase for each.
:::

## Comorbidity

- More than one diagnosis at the same time
- Common in real clinical settings
- Changes planning and treatment

::: notes
Visual cue: Two diagnosis cards in one file.
:::

## Heterogeneity

- Same label can look different across people
- Different symptom profiles can meet criteria
- Impairment can vary widely within a label

::: notes
Visual cue: One label feeding into multiple symptom profiles.
:::

## Differential diagnosis

- Similar symptoms can reflect different conditions
- Course and context matter
- Evidence quality and uncertainty matter

::: notes
Visual cue: Symptom cluster → multiple possible explanations → more information needed.
:::

## Multi-factor models

- Vulnerability and stress interact
- Risk and protective factors shift likelihood and course
- Biology, psychology, and context all contribute

::: notes
Visual cue: Vulnerability + stressor → outcomes, with protective factors as buffers.
:::

## Diathesis-stress model

- Diathesis: vulnerability
- Stress: trigger or demand
- Interaction predicts risk and course

::: notes
Visual cue: Two-axis graph: vulnerability and stress, risk increases toward top-right.
:::

## Prevalence and incidence

- Prevalence: how common a condition is
- Incidence: new cases over time
- Numbers depend on definition and measurement

::: notes
Guardrail: avoid quoting prevalence without population and method.
Visual cue: “number” bubble tied to population and method labels.
:::

## Culture shapes symptoms and help-seeking

- Culture shapes meaning and expression of distress
- Culture shapes what counts as impairing
- Culture shapes help-seeking pathways

::: notes
Visual cue: Same symptom described differently across contexts.
Guardrail: culture is relevant across diagnoses, not only “special syndromes.”
:::

## Stigma and barriers matter

- Stigma can reduce help-seeking
- Barriers can worsen outcomes independently of symptoms
- Social context can shape recovery

::: notes
Visual cue: Symptoms lane and stigma/barrier lane both feeding into functioning.
:::

## A vignette: distress, impairment, context

Scenario: a student avoids class presentations

- Distress may be high
- Impairment depends on functioning demands
- Context changes what is feasible and safe

::: notes
Teaching move: ask what additional information is needed for differential diagnosis.
:::

## Common confusions to avoid

- Diagnosis explains cause
- Categories are sharply separated
- Symptoms always mean severe impairment
- Culture is irrelevant to diagnosis
- Stigma is minor

::: notes
Use as a reset before retrieval.
:::

## Quick check

Match the term to the best description

- Distress
- Impairment
- Comorbidity
- Heterogeneity
- Differential diagnosis
- Diathesis-stress model
- Prevalence
- Incidence
- Stigma

::: notes
Delivery: students commit first, then you reveal.
One discriminating cue per match.
:::

## Quick check answers

- Distress: subjective suffering and discomfort
- Impairment: reduced functioning in important areas
- Comorbidity: more than one diagnosis at the same time
- Heterogeneity: one label with many different presentations
- Differential diagnosis: similar symptoms, different possible conditions
- Diathesis-stress model: vulnerability interacts with stress to shape risk
- Prevalence: how common in a population at a time
- Incidence: new cases over time window
- Stigma: social devaluation and barriers that reduce care and worsen outcomes

::: notes
Keep it brief. Do not re-lecture.
:::

## Bridge to Topic 24

- Diagnosis supports planning, not automatic explanation
- Treatment depends on evidence, preference, severity, and access
- Next: therapies and how effectiveness is evaluated

::: notes
Visual cue: Label → options → evidence and fit filter → plan.
