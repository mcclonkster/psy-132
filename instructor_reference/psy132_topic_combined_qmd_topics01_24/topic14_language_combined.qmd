## What this topic covers

- Language as a structured, generative system
- Core components of language
- Language development and learning mechanisms
- What language does and does not do to thought

::: notes
Visual cue: Components → development → use and meaning.
:::

## Language is structured and generative

- Rules produce many possible messages
- Structure changes meaning
- Language is learned in context

::: notes
Guardrail: language is not only memorized phrases.
:::

## Core components of language

```{mermaid}
flowchart TB
L[Language] --> P[Phonemes]
L --> M[Morphemes]
L --> SY[Syntax]
L --> SE[Semantics]
L --> PR[Pragmatics]
```

::: notes
Caption cue: components work together in real communication.
:::

## Phonemes

- Smallest sound units that change meaning
- Languages use different phoneme sets
- One sound change can change a word

::: notes
Visual cue: Two words differing by one phoneme.
:::

## Morphemes

- Smallest meaning units in language
- Combine to build words
- Rule use shows more than memorization

::: notes
Visual cue: Root plus suffix producing a new meaning.
:::

## Syntax and semantics

- Syntax organizes word order
- Semantics is literal meaning
- Structure can change meaning

::: notes
Visual cue: Same words in a different order producing different meaning.
:::

## Pragmatics

- Meaning depends on social context
- Intent can differ from literal wording
- Context guides what is appropriate

::: notes
Visual cue: “Can you pass the salt” literal vs intended meaning.
:::

## Language development is patterned and variable

- Typical milestones exist
- Timing varies across children and contexts
- Wide variability is normal

::: notes
Guardrail: avoid treating ages as fixed universal rules.
Visual cue: Milestone timeline with wide bands.
:::

## Early milestones

- Babbling
- First words and holophrases
- Two-word combinations
- Telegraphic speech

::: notes
Visual cue: Four-stage strip with one example utterance per stage.
:::

## Overregularization

- Children apply rules broadly
- Errors can show rule learning
- Errors are not evidence of “not learning”

::: notes
Visual cue: Regular rule applied to an irregular form, producing an error.
:::

## Fast mapping

- Word meanings can be learned quickly from limited exposure
- Later exposures refine meaning
- Context guides inference

::: notes
Visual cue: New word heard once → likely referent → refinement over time.
:::

## Child-directed speech

- Often simpler structure and clearer cues
- Supports attention and segmentation
- Varies across cultures and families

::: notes
Guardrail: absence of child-directed speech does not imply poor language development.
Visual cue: Adult utterance vs child-directed version with clearer boundaries.
:::

## Learning-based accounts

- Emphasize experience and input
- Emphasize feedback and practice
- Explain growth from exposure

::: notes
Visual cue: Many input examples strengthening patterns.
:::

## Nativist accounts

- Emphasize innate constraints on learning
- Suggest specialized readiness for language
- Treat “language acquisition device” as a hypothesis

::: notes
Guardrail: avoid presenting the language acquisition device as a confirmed anatomical module.
Visual cue: Constraints as guide rails supporting learning from input.
:::

## The debate is about mechanisms

- It is not whether learning matters
- It is about what enables rapid learning
- Multiple processes can contribute

::: notes
Visual cue: Overlapping circles labeled learning mechanisms and constraints.
:::

## Critical period hypothesis

- Some aspects may be easier early
- Sensitivity to input can change over time
- Evidence is complex

::: notes
Guardrail: do not treat any one case as decisive proof.
Visual cue: Sensitivity curve that changes gradually, not a hard cutoff.
:::

## Bilingualism

- Children can learn multiple languages without confusion
- Outcomes depend on exposure and context
- Development can look different across settings

::: notes
Guardrail: avoid “bilingualism causes confusion” myths.
Visual cue: Two input streams feeding into one learner, moderated by exposure.
:::

## Language and thought

- Language can influence attention and categorization in some contexts
- Strong “language determines thought” claims are not supported
- Effects tend to be domain-specific and modest

::: notes
Visual cue: Labels nudging categorization for the same scene.
Guardrail: avoid strong linguistic determinism claims.
:::

## Worked example: pragmatics in action

Scenario: “Can you open the window”

- Literal meaning is a question about ability
- Intended meaning is a polite request
- Context and relationship guide interpretation

::: notes
Teaching move: ask students to generate a second example where pragmatics changes meaning.
:::

## Common confusions to avoid

- Language is memorization
- One case proves a critical period
- Language determines thought
- Bilingualism causes confusion

::: notes
Use as a reset before retrieval.

## Quick check

Match the term to the best description

- Phoneme
- Morpheme
- Syntax
- Semantics
- Pragmatics
- Holophrase
- Telegraphic speech
- Overregularization
- Fast mapping
- Critical period hypothesis
- Linguistic relativity

::: notes
Delivery: students commit first, then you reveal.
One discriminating cue per match.
:::

## Quick check answers

- Phoneme: sound unit that changes meaning
- Morpheme: meaning unit in language
- Syntax: rule system for word order
- Semantics: literal meaning of words and sentences
- Pragmatics: meaning shaped by social context
- Holophrase: one word used as a full message
- Telegraphic speech: short content-heavy phrases missing function words
- Overregularization: applying a rule too broadly
- Fast mapping: rapid initial word learning from limited exposure
- Critical period hypothesis: early sensitivity window with complex evidence
- Linguistic relativity: language can nudge thought in limited ways

::: notes
Keep it brief. Do not re-lecture.
:::

## Bridge to Topic 15

- Language development is one window into broader development
- Development reflects biology, experience, and context
- Next: development across the life span

::: notes
Visual cue: Early language milestones feeding into a life-span timeline.
