## What this topic covers

- How ethical research protects welfare and rights
- How consent, privacy, and risk management work
- Why oversight and fairness matter for research quality

::: notes
Visual cue: Three lenses labeled Consent, Risk, Fairness feeding into “Responsible research.”
:::

---

## Ethics is part of research quality

- Research can help and harm
- Ethical design reduces preventable harm
- Trustworthy science requires responsible practice

::: notes
Visual cue: Two pillars labeled Welfare and Knowledge supporting Responsible research.

## Ethical decision workflow

Q[Research question] --> R[Risk and benefit]

F --> O[Oversight]
O --> D[Data collection]
D --> M[Monitor and debrief]
```

::: notes
Teaching move: Ask, “Which step is the weak point in this study design?”
:::

---

## Three guiding principles

- Respect for persons
- Beneficence
- Justice

::: notes
Visual cue: Three-column organizer.
Say one plain phrase aloud for each principle.
:::

---

## Informed consent

- Disclosure
- Comprehension
- Voluntariness

::: notes
Visual cue: Consent card with three checkpoints.
Guardrail: consent is a process, not only a signature.
:::

---

## Right to withdraw

- Participation is voluntary
- Stopping should not create penalty
- Withdrawal should be feasible in practice

::: notes
Teaching move: Ask what an ethical “no penalty” alternative looks like in a course study.
:::

---

## Coercion and undue influence

- Power differences can pressure choices
- Incentives can distort voluntariness
- Vulnerable populations may need extra safeguards

::: notes
Visual cue: Power gradient plus a pressure meter.
:::

---

## Risk and minimal risk

- Risk should be minimized
- Minimal risk is a common benchmark
- Higher risk requires stronger safeguards

::: notes
Visual cue: Risk thermometer with safeguards rising as risk rises.
:::

---

## Privacy protection

- Confidentiality protects identity and records
- Anonymity prevents linking data to identity
- Safeguards reduce harm

::: notes
Visual cue: Two locks labeled Confidentiality and Anonymity.
:::

---

## Confidentiality versus anonymity

:::: columns
::: column
Confidentiality
- Identity link exists
- Protection depends on safeguards
- Access must be restricted
:::

::: column
Anonymity
- No identity link is possible
- Stronger privacy by design
- Not always feasible
:::
::::

::: notes
Teaching move: Ask which one is feasible for a classroom survey and why.
:::

---

## Deception requires justification

- Not automatically unethical
- Must be necessary for the question
- Must be minimized

::: notes
Visual cue: Deception card with a “justify” stamp.
Guardrail: deception is not a default tool.
:::

---

## Debriefing repairs autonomy

- Explain what was withheld
- Correct misconceptions
- Reduce harm and restore trust

::: notes
Visual cue: Before and after belief panels.
:::

---

## Oversight review

- Review occurs before data collection
- Review evaluates risk, consent, and fairness
- Oversight does not replace researcher responsibility

::: notes
Visual cue: Plan → review → revise → run.
:::

---

## Institutional review board

- Reviews human research protocols
- Requires protections for participants
- Can require changes to improve safeguards

::: notes
Visual cue: Review gate before the study can begin.
:::

---

## Equitable selection

- Recruitment should be fair
- Benefits and burdens should not be skewed
- Inclusion and exclusion require reasons

::: notes
Visual cue: Recruitment funnel with fairness checkpoints.
:::

---

## Ethical issues in incentives and grading

- Extra credit can pressure participation
- Alternatives should be equal in effort and value
- Transparency reduces coercion risk

::: notes
Visual cue: Two equal pathways: participate or alternative assignment.
:::

---

## Animal research

- Scientific justification is required
- Humane treatment is required
- Oversight is required

::: notes
Visual cue: Justification, Minimization, Oversight.
:::

---

## Replace, reduce, refine

- Replace animals when possible
- Reduce numbers when appropriate
- Refine procedures to minimize pain and distress

::: notes
Visual cue: Three cards labeled Replace, Reduce, Refine.
:::

---

## Case-based caution is about safeguards

- Focus on what protection was missing
- Focus on what would prevent harm now
- Do not treat any case as entertainment

::: notes
Visual cue: Case → missing safeguard → improved design.
:::

---

## Common confusions to avoid

- Ethics is only paperwork
- Consent is a signature
- Deception is always unethical
- Oversight guarantees ethical conduct

::: notes
Use as a reset before retrieval practice.
:::

---

## Quick check

Decide what needs to be improved

- Extra credit only for participation
- Names collected with sensitive responses
- Deception with a vague debriefing
- Excluding a group with no stated reason

::: notes
Delivery: students identify the principle and the safeguard fix.
Commit first, then reveal.
:::

---

## Quick check answers

- Extra credit only: undue influence, add equal alternative
- Names with sensitive data: confidentiality risk, use de-identification or anonymity when feasible
- Vague debriefing: insufficient debriefing, provide meaningful explanation and correction
- Unjustified exclusion: justice issue, justify criteria or revise recruitment

::: notes
Keep each explanation to one safeguard.
:::

---

## Bridge to Topic 6

- Ethics constrains what studies should do
- Neuroscience explains the systems that make behavior possible
- Next: neurons, synapses, and brain-behavior evidence

::: notes
Visual cue: Ethics boundary line leading into brain-behavior systems.
