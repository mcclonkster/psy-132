## What this topic covers

- How neurons communicate
- How the nervous system is organized
- How brain-behavior links are studied, with limits

::: notes
Visual cue: Three-part map: communication, organization, methods and limits.
:::

## The big idea

- Neurons use electrical signals within cells
- Neurons use chemical signals across synapses
- Brain functions rely on networks, not single centers

::: notes
Visual cue: Electrical within, chemical across, network-level outcome.
Guardrail: avoid one-region “emotion center” language.
:::

## Nervous system organization

```{mermaid}
flowchart TB
NS[Nervous system] --> CNS[Central nervous system]
NS --> PNS[Peripheral nervous system]
CNS --> B[Brain]
CNS --> S[Spinal cord]
PNS --> Som[Somatic]
PNS --> Aut[Autonomic]
Aut --> Sym[Sympathetic]
Aut --> Para[Parasympathetic]
```

::: notes
Teaching move: ask students to name one function for each branch.
:::

## Central nervous system

- Brain and spinal cord
- Integrates information
- Coordinates responses

::: notes
Visual cue: Simple brain and spinal cord diagram.
:::

## Peripheral nervous system

- Nerves outside the brain and spinal cord
- Carries signals to and from the CNS
- Divides into somatic and autonomic systems

::: notes
Visual cue: Body outline with peripheral nerves highlighted.
:::

## Somatic nervous system

- Sensation from body and environment
- Voluntary movement control
- Fast feedback for action

::: notes
Visual cue: Sensory input and motor output arrows.
:::

## Autonomic nervous system

- Regulates internal organs and glands
- Coordinates arousal and recovery
- Runs largely outside conscious control

::: notes
Visual cue: Organ regulation icons (heart, lungs) with “automatic regulation” label.
Guardrail: autonomic activity is regulated, not “random.”
:::

## Sympathetic and parasympathetic patterns

:::: columns
::: column
Sympathetic
- Mobilizes energy
- Increases readiness
- Supports action
:::

::: column
Parasympathetic
- Restores energy
- Supports digestion and recovery
- Supports calm states
:::
::::

::: notes
Visual cue: Two dials rather than a single on-off switch.
Guardrail: the systems can both be active to different degrees.
:::

## Neuron structure

- Dendrites receive input
- Axons send output
- Myelin increases signal speed

::: notes
Visual cue: Labeled neuron diagram.
:::

## Glial cells support neurons

- Support and protect neurons
- Help maintain healthy signaling
- Contribute to brain function over time

::: notes
Visual cue: Neuron surrounded by glial “support” cells.
:::

## Electrical signaling inside neurons

- Resting potential reflects charge difference
- Action potential is a rapid electrical change
- Signals travel along axons

::: notes
Visual cue: Spike traveling down an axon.
Keep it conceptual, not math-heavy.
:::

## Chemical signaling across synapses

- Synapses connect neurons
- Neurotransmitters bind to receptors
- Reuptake can reduce signaling

::: notes
Visual cue: Synapse diagram labeling neurotransmitter, receptor, reuptake.
Guardrail: neurotransmitters do not have one simple effect.
:::

## Neurotransmitters are pathway-dependent

- The same neurotransmitter can do different things
- Effects depend on receptor type and pathway
- Labels do not guarantee one simple outcome

::: notes
Visual cue: One neurotransmitter branching into multiple pathways.
Example to say aloud: dopamine and serotonin have multiple receptor types.
:::

## Plasticity

- The brain changes with experience
- Learning changes connections over time
- Recovery after injury can involve reorganization

::: notes
Visual cue: Timeline showing gradual change, not instant rewiring.
Guardrail: plasticity is change over time, not guaranteed improvement.
:::

## Networks over centers

- Many functions use distributed networks
- Connections matter as much as regions
- Single-center stories are usually misleading

::: notes
Visual cue: Network map with nodes and connections.
Teaching move: ask students to name a network-like function (language, attention).
:::

## Hemispheric specialization is partial

- Some functions show division of labor
- Integration across hemispheres is extensive
- Specialization is not absolute

::: notes
Visual cue: Two hemispheres connected by thick communication lines.
Key example: split-brain findings illustrate partial specialization.
:::

## How we study brain and behavior

- Lesion evidence links damage to function
- Imaging measures structure or activity proxies
- Each method has strengths and limits

::: notes
Visual cue: Method cards labeled Lesion, EEG, MRI, fMRI, PET, CT.
Guardrail: methods are proxies, not direct “thought reading.”
:::

## EEG

- Measures electrical activity at the scalp
- Strong timing information
- Limited location precision

::: notes
Visual cue: Head cap with signal traces.
Keep comparison language: timing strong, location limited.
:::

## MRI and fMRI

- MRI measures structure
- fMRI estimates activity with a blood-oxygen proxy
- Stronger location than EEG, weaker timing than EEG

::: notes
Visual cue: Brain image card labeled structure and blood-oxygen proxy.
Guardrail: fMRI is an indirect measure of neural activity.
:::

## PET and CT

- PET measures metabolic activity with tracers
- CT measures structural images with X-rays
- Use depends on question and constraints

::: notes
Visual cue: PET as “metabolism proxy,” CT as “structure.”
Keep details minimal.
:::

## Interpreting evidence requires caution

- Correlation is not causation in imaging
- Strong claims require converging evidence
- Good interpretation states limits explicitly

::: notes
Visual cue: “Proxy” stamp on method cards plus a “converge” arrow from multiple methods.
:::

## Key evidence anchors

- Split-brain research: hemispheric communication
- Visual cortex research: feature detection
- Lesions and language: evidence and limits

::: notes
Use anchors as examples of inference, not as one-study proof.
Keep language network-based.
:::

## Quick check

Match the item to the best description

- Action potential
- Synapse
- Neurotransmitter
- Reuptake
- Somatic nervous system
- Autonomic nervous system
- Sympathetic division
- Parasympathetic division
- Neuroplasticity

::: notes
Delivery: students commit first, then you reveal.
Use one discriminating cue per match.
:::

## Quick check answers

- Action potential: rapid electrical signal within a neuron
- Synapse: connection point where neurons communicate
- Neurotransmitter: chemical messenger across a synapse
- Reuptake: reabsorption that reduces neurotransmitter signaling
- Somatic nervous system: sensation and voluntary movement
- Autonomic nervous system: automatic organ regulation
- Sympathetic division: mobilizes energy and readiness
- Parasympathetic division: supports recovery and conservation
- Neuroplasticity: change in neural connections over time
- EEG: scalp electrical activity, strong timing
- fMRI: activity proxy using blood-oxygen changes, stronger location than EEG

::: notes
Keep it brief. Do not turn answers into re-lecture.

## Bridge to Topic 7

- Neuroscience explains how signals travel through systems
- Sensation begins with transduction in sensory receptors
- Next: how stimuli become neural signals

::: notes
Visual cue: Stimulus → receptor → neural signal.
