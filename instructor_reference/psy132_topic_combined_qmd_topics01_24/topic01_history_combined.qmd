## What this topic covers

- How psychology became a science
- Why early approaches disagreed
- How multiple lenses are used today

::: notes
Visual cue: Three-part map: Science shift, Early disagreements, Modern lenses.
:::

## Psychology becomes a science

- Psychology studies behavior and mental processes
- Explanations should be testable
- Evidence should be systematic

::: notes
Visual cue: Question → method → evidence loop.
Caption cue: Strong claims produce predictions you can test.
:::

## The science loop

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
Q[Question] --> M[Method]
M --> E[Evidence]
E --> R[Revise explanation]
R --> Q
```

::: notes
Teaching move: Ask "What would count as evidence against this explanation?"
:::

## Why early approaches disagreed

- They asked different questions
- They used different methods
- They emphasized different explanations

::: notes
Visual cue: Two-column contrast labeled Question and Method.
Optional prompt: Use "What causes fear?" as one topic with different questions.
:::

## How to read an approach

- Focus: what it studies
- Method: how it studies it
- Signature: what it treats as most important

::: notes
Visual cue: Reusable three-row template that you repeat on each approach slide.
:::

## Structuralism studies conscious experience

- Focus: conscious experience as parts
- Method: introspection
- Signature: analyze elements of experience

::: notes
Anchor: Wilhelm Wundt and Edward Titchener, late 1800s.
Visual cue: Labeled parts diagram.
Guardrail: Introspection is difficult to verify across people.
:::

## Functionalism studies what the mind does

- Focus: purpose of thinking and behavior
- Method: broad and practical tools
- Signature: function and adaptation

::: notes
Anchor: William James, late 1800s.
Visual cue: Problem → function → outcome arrows.
:::

## Psychoanalytic theory emphasizes the unconscious

- Focus: motives outside awareness and conflict
- Method: clinical observation and interpretation
- Signature: early experience shapes patterns

::: notes
Anchor: Sigmund Freud, early 1900s.
Visual cue: Iceberg with constrained labels.
Guardrail: Unconscious processes are inferred, not directly observed.
:::

## Gestalt psychology emphasizes organized perception

- Focus: perception as patterns and wholes
- Method: perception experiments
- Signature: the whole shapes the parts

::: notes
Anchor: Max Wertheimer and colleagues, early 1900s.
Visual cue: Figure-ground and closure examples.
Caption cue: Perception groups elements into patterns.
:::

## Behaviorism emphasizes observable behavior

- Focus: observable behavior
- Method: controlled experiments
- Signature: learning through conditioning

::: notes
Anchor: John Watson and B. F. Skinner, 1900s.
Visual cue: Stimulus → response → consequence.
:::

## Humanistic psychology emphasizes meaning and growth

- Focus: meaning, values, self-concept
- Method: lived experience in context
- Signature: autonomy and potential

::: notes
Anchor: Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow, mid 1900s.
Visual cue: Values-to-growth path or needs-to-growth ladder.
Guardrail: Avoid slogan phrasing; keep examples concrete.
:::

## Cognitive psychology studies mental processes scientifically

- Focus: attention, memory, thinking
- Method: infer processes from performance
- Signature: information processing models

::: notes
Anchor: George Miller and Ulric Neisser, mid 1900s.
Visual cue: Input → processing → output.
Concrete proxies to say aloud: accuracy, reaction time, recall.
:::

## Multicultural psychology expands what counts as general

- Focus: culture and context shape meaning
- Method: improve sampling and measurement validity
- Signature: reduce biased conclusions

::: notes
Visual cue: Same situation, different cultural frames.
Framing cue: Cross-cutting lens across domains, not one bounded historical school.
:::

## Misconception reset

- Approaches did not replace each other in a straight line
- Many ideas overlap and persist
- Different lenses can be useful for different questions

::: notes
Visual cue: Timeline bands that overlap rather than a single chain.
:::

## Overlap rather than replacement

```{mermaid}
flowchart TB
A[Earlier approaches] --> B[Later approaches]
A --> C[Ideas persist and evolve]
B --> C
C --> D[Multiple lenses used today]
```

::: notes
Teaching move: Ask students to name one idea that persists (learning, perception, meaning, cognition).
:::

## Modern psychology uses multiple levels of explanation

- Biological level
- Cognitive level
- Behavioral level
- Social and cultural level

::: notes
Visual cue: One behavior with multiple labeled lenses.
Keep labels consistent with later topics.
:::

## Worked example: One behavior, different lenses

Example: procrastination

:::: columns
::: column
Behavioral lens
- What consequences maintain delay
- What reinforces avoidance
:::

::: column
Cognitive lens
- What beliefs drive delay
- What attention patterns sustain it
:::

::: column
Social-cultural lens
- What norms shape expectations
- What constraints shape options
:::
::::

::: notes
Teaching move: Ask "What evidence would support each lens for the same behavior?"
Keep the walkthrough short: question → evidence → conclusion limits.
:::

## Quick check

:::: columns
::: column
Approach
- Behaviorism
- Psychoanalytic theory
- Humanistic psychology
- Gestalt psychology
- Cognitive psychology
- Functionalism
:::

::: column
Emphasis
- Observable behavior and learning history
- Unconscious motives and conflict
- Meaning, values, and growth
- Organized perception and patterns
- Mental processes inferred from performance
- Function and adaptation
:::
::::

::: notes
Delivery: Students match first, then you reveal.
Prompt: Ask "What is the discriminating cue for each match?"
:::

## Quick check answers

- Behaviorism → Observable behavior and learning history
- Psychoanalytic theory → Unconscious motives and conflict
- Humanistic psychology → Meaning, values, and growth
- Gestalt psychology → Organized perception and patterns
- Cognitive psychology → Mental processes inferred from performance
- Functionalism → Function and adaptation

::: notes
Keep each explanation to one discriminating cue.
:::

## Bridge to Topic 2

- Different lenses suggest different hypotheses
- Methods test hypotheses
- Next: how perspectives guide questions and evidence

::: notes
Visual cue: Lens → hypothesis → method filter → conclusion strength.

## Key concepts

- first labs
- structuralism
- functionalism
- early scientific psychology
- psychoanalysis
- unconscious
- historical impact
- introspection
- method limitations
- structuralism vs functionalism
- behaviorism
- cognitive

## Key terms

- James
- history
- structuralism
- functionalism
- Freud
- psychoanalysis
- unconscious
- Titchener
- introspection
- limitations
- comparison

- Why psychology contains multiple theoretical perspectives rather than one single “final” explanation
- How historical shifts in what counted as evidence connect to why modern research methods matter
