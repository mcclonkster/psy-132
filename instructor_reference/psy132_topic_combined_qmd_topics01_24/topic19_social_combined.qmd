## What this topic covers

- How social context shapes thought, feeling, and behavior
- Social cognition and attribution
- Social influence and group processes
- Intergroup dynamics and bias

::: notes
Visual cue: One person in the center with lenses labeled cognition, influence, groups, intergroup.
:::

## Social psychology studies context

- Situations influence behavior
- Interpretation shapes response
- Group norms and roles matter

::: notes
Guardrail: situation effects do not deny personality differences.
:::

## From situation to behavior

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
S[Situation] --> I[Interpretation]
I --> A[Attribution]
A --> R[Response]
G[Group norms and roles] --> R
```

::: notes
Caption cue: what you think is happening shapes what you do.
:::

## Attribution

- Attribution is explaining behavior
- Explanations can be dispositional or situational
- Biases can shift explanations

::: notes
Visual cue: Two-column frame: person causes vs situation causes.
:::

## Fundamental attribution error

- Overemphasize traits in others
- Underemphasize constraints in situations
- Stronger when context is hidden

::: notes
Visual cue: Spotlight on the person, background dimmed.
:::

## Actor-observer difference

- You explain your behavior with situations
- You explain others with traits
- Perspective changes what information you have

::: notes
Visual cue: Two camera angles: inside actor view, outside observer view.
:::

## Self-serving bias

- Success: internal explanations
- Failure: external explanations
- Protects self-image in many contexts

::: notes
Visual cue: Success and failure cards feeding into different explanations.
:::

## Norms, roles, scripts

- Norm: shared expectation
- Role: expected behavior in a position
- Script: expected sequence in a situation

::: notes
Visual cue: Classroom script example.
:::

## Conformity

- Conformity is changing behavior to match a group
- Normative influence: desire to fit in
- Informational influence: desire to be correct

::: notes
Guardrail: conformity can be public compliance without private agreement.
Visual cue: Fit in vs be correct pathways.
:::

## Obedience

- Obedience is following authority directives
- Roles and framing can increase compliance
- Obedience is not always physically coerced

::: notes
Visual cue: Authority cue → role framing → action.
Guardrail: keep classic studies as mechanism illustrations, not moral parables.
:::

## Groupthink and polarization

:::: columns
::: column
Groupthink
- pressure for consensus
- reduced critical evaluation
- narrower decisions
:::

::: column
Group polarization
- discussion strengthens initial leanings
- more extreme group position
- shared arguments intensify attitudes
:::
::::

::: notes
Visual cue: Two outcomes from the same group discussion.
Guardrail: not all groups show these patterns.
:::

## Social facilitation and loafing

:::: columns
::: column
Social facilitation
- improves simple tasks
- impairs complex tasks
- arousal and evaluation matter
:::

::: column
Social loafing
- reduced effort in groups
- more likely when effort is unidentifiable
- reduced by accountability
:::
::::

::: notes
Visual cue: Performance curve and effort bars.
:::

## Helping and the bystander effect

- Notice the event
- Interpret as an emergency
- Assume responsibility
- Know how to help and act

::: notes
Visual cue: Decision steps model.
Guardrail: do not use simplified myths as proof; focus on mechanism.
:::

## Diffusion of responsibility

- Responsibility is shared across bystanders
- Each person feels less personal duty
- Direct requests can reduce diffusion

::: notes
Visual cue: Responsibility “pie” split among bystanders.
:::

## Stereotype, prejudice, discrimination

:::: columns
::: column
Stereotype
- belief or expectation about a group
:::

::: column
Prejudice
- evaluative attitude toward a group
:::

::: column
Discrimination
- behavior and unequal treatment
:::
::::

::: notes
Guardrail: keep these terms distinct.
:::

## Social identity

- Identity shapes belonging and meaning
- Ingroup and outgroup categories shift behavior
- Categorization can produce favoritism

::: notes
Visual cue: Identity badge plus ingroup-outgroup circles.
Anchor: minimal group effects as an illustration of categorization.
:::

## Stereotype threat

- Context cues can affect performance
- Effects depend on stakes and identity relevance
- Changing cues can reduce threat

::: notes
Visual cue: Testing cues → load → performance.
Guardrail: keep claims conditional and context-based.
:::

## Worked example: one behavior, two lenses

Scenario: a student stays quiet in class

:::: columns
::: column
Attribution lens
- trait explanation: “shy”
- constraint explanation: “unclear expectations”
:::

::: column
Norms and roles lens
- classroom norms discourage speaking
- role expectations shape behavior
:::
::::

::: notes
Teaching move: ask students what additional information would change the explanation.
:::

## Common confusions to avoid

- Social psychology denies personality
- Conformity means agreement
- Bystanders do not care
- Stereotypes are always conscious

::: notes
Use as a reset before retrieval.
:::

::: notes
Delivery: students commit first, then you reveal.
One discriminating cue per match.
:::

## Quick check answers

- Fundamental attribution error: overemphasize traits, underemphasize constraints
- Actor-observer difference: self explained by situation, others by traits
- Self-serving bias: success internal, failure external
- Norm: shared expectation
- Role: expected behavior in a position
- Script: expected sequence in a situation
- Normative influence: fit in
- Informational influence: be correct
- Groupthink: pressure for consensus reduces critique
- Group polarization: discussion strengthens initial leanings
- Social loafing: reduced effort when effort is unidentifiable
- Diffusion of responsibility: shared presence reduces personal duty
- Stereotype: belief or expectation about a group
- Prejudice: evaluative attitude
- Discrimination: behavior and unequal treatment
- Social identity: group membership shaping belonging and behavior
- Stereotype threat: performance affected by stereotype-relevant cues

::: notes
Keep explanations short and discriminating.
:::

## Bridge to Topic 20

- Social context shapes behavior in predictable ways
- Personality describes stable tendencies
- Next: traits, assessment, and person-situation interaction

::: notes
Visual cue: Person and situation both feeding into behavior.
