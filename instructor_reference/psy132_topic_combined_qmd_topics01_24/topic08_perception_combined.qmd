## What this topic covers

- How perception organizes and interprets sensory input
- How bottom-up and top-down processes interact
- How attention, depth, and multisensory integration shape experience

::: notes
Visual cue: Sensation → perception → experience pipeline.
:::

## Perception is organization and interpretation

- Sensation encodes input
- Perception organizes patterns
- Perception assigns meaning in context

::: notes
Guardrail: perception is not a perfect copy of reality.
:::

## Bottom-up and top-down work together

::: notes
Caption cue: perception reflects both input and interpretation.
:::

## Bottom-up processing

- Builds from sensory features
- Supports detection and grouping
- Constrains what can be perceived

::: notes
Visual cue: Features → pattern → object.
:::

## Top-down processing

- Uses knowledge and expectations
- Uses context and goals
- Shapes interpretation under ambiguity

::: notes
Visual cue: Context frame changing what an ambiguous stimulus means.
:::

## Perceptual set

- Expectations bias what you notice
- Expectations bias what you interpret
- Context can change the same input

::: notes
Visual cue: Ambiguous image with two context labels producing two interpretations.
:::

## Perceptual organization

- Grouping simplifies complex scenes
- Grouping follows predictable tendencies
- Tendencies can create illusions

::: notes
Visual cue: Dots grouped into lines after highlighting proximity and similarity.
:::

## Gestalt principles: what to notice

- Proximity: near elements group
- Similarity: similar elements group
- Continuity: patterns follow smooth paths
- Closure: missing parts are filled in
- Figure-ground: object separates from background

::: notes
Visual cue: If you use images, label the intended takeaway and keep them large.
Accessibility cue: add a short caption for each image.
:::

## Figure-ground

- Perception separates object from background
- The same input can support different interpretations

::: notes
Visual cue: Figure-ground image with a caption stating the intended separation.
:::

## Perceptual constancy

- Stable perception despite changing input
- Size and shape constancy are common examples
- Constancy is useful, not perfect

::: notes
Visual cue: Same object at different distances with “stable size perception” label.
:::

## Depth perception uses multiple cues

:::: columns
::: column
Binocular cues
- two-eye information
- disparity and convergence
:::

::: column
Monocular cues
- one-eye information
- perspective, overlap, relative size
:::
::::

::: notes
Visual cue: Two-column organizer with one example image for each side.
:::

## Binocular disparity

- Two eyes see slightly different images
- Differences support depth judgments
- Strongest for nearby objects

::: notes
Visual cue: Two-eye lines and a near object highlighted.
:::

## Monocular cues

- Linear perspective supports distance
- Interposition supports depth from overlap
- Relative size supports distance comparison

::: notes
Visual cue: Road or hallway image labeled with cue names.
:::

## Selective attention

- Attention prioritizes information
- Attention has limits
- Limits produce predictable misses

::: notes
Visual cue: Spotlight model of attention over a scene.
:::

## Inattentional blindness

- People can miss obvious events
- Misses depend on task and focus
- Limits matter in everyday life

::: notes
Visual cue: Inattentional blindness demonstration still with a caption.
Guardrail: do not present as a personal flaw; it reflects system limits.
:::

## Change blindness

- Large changes can be missed
- Misses increase when attention is disrupted
- Perception is not continuous recording

::: notes
Visual cue: Two images with a change; show how attention disruption hides it.
:::

## Signal detection theory

- Sensitivity reflects detection ability
- Criterion reflects decision threshold
- Uncertainty requires separating the two

::: notes
Visual cue: Two dials labeled Sensitivity and Criterion.
Guardrail: motivation and costs often shift criterion, not sensitivity.
:::

## Multisensory integration

- Inputs across senses combine
- Integration can improve perception
- Integration can also produce illusions

::: notes
Visual cue: Audio and visual streams merging into one perception output.
:::

## McGurk effect

- Visual speech cues influence what you hear
- Perception integrates senses in speech

::: notes
Visual cue: Mouth movement plus audio leading to a different perceived syllable.
Guardrail: effects vary by person and context.
:::

## Rubber hand illusion

- Vision and touch can shift ownership experience
- Integration contributes to body representation

::: notes
Visual cue: Hand with synchronized touch cues shifting “ownership” rating.
Guardrail: use as evidence for integration, not as proof of one grand theory of self.
:::

## Common confusions to avoid

- Perception equals reality
- Top-down equals bias and bottom-up equals truth
- Attention is stable and continuous
- Illusions mean perception is weak

::: notes
Use as a reset before retrieval.
Frame illusions as informative about system tendencies.
