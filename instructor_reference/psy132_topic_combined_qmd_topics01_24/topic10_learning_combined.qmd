## What this topic covers

- Learning as change from experience
- Learning by association and consequences
- Learning by observing others
- Why learning can persist and return

::: notes
Visual cue: Three routes into learning: association, consequences, observation.
:::

## Learning is change from experience

- Relatively enduring change from experience
- Inferred from behavior change over time
- Not maturation, reflexes, or fatigue

::: notes
Visual cue: Before and after behavior trace with “experience” marked between.
:::

## Three routes to learning

L --> B[Change over time]
```

::: notes
Caption cue: different mechanisms can produce similar behavior change.
:::

## Habituation

- Reduced responding after repeated exposure
- Helps focus on change rather than constant input
- Can look like ignoring, but it is learning

::: notes
Visual cue: Repeated stimulus with declining response curve.
:::

## Classical conditioning predicts what comes next

- Learning relationships between stimuli
- Neutral cues gain meaning through pairing
- Supports reflex-like and emotional responses

::: notes
Visual cue: Neutral cue + meaningful event → anticipatory response.
:::

## Classical conditioning terms

- Unconditioned stimulus and unconditioned response
- Conditioned stimulus and conditioned response
- Acquisition builds the association

::: notes
Visual cue: Two paired pathways: UCS → UCR and CS → CR.
Use one simple example aloud and reuse it.
:::

## Extinction and return

- Extinction decreases conditioned responding when pairing stops
- Extinction does not guarantee erasure
- Spontaneous recovery can occur after time

::: notes
Visual cue: Response declines during extinction, then partially returns after a delay.
:::

## Generalization and discrimination

- Generalization: learning transfers to similar cues
- Discrimination: learning becomes specific to a cue
- Both reflect how cues are interpreted

::: notes
Visual cue: Stimulus gradient with strongest response near the trained cue.
:::

## Operant conditioning shapes what you do

- Learning relationships between behavior and consequences
- Consequences change future probability of behavior
- Behavior is shaped over time

::: notes
Visual cue: Antecedent → behavior → consequence loop.
:::

## Reinforcement and punishment

- Reinforcement increases behavior
- Punishment decreases behavior
- Definitions depend on effects, not intentions

::: notes
Visual cue: Two columns labeled Increases and Decreases with arrows.
:::

## Positive and negative reinforcement

- Positive reinforcement adds something to increase behavior
- Negative reinforcement removes something to increase behavior
- Negative reinforcement is not punishment

::: notes
Visual cue: Add vs Remove, both pointing to Increased behavior.
:::

## Punishment limits

- Punishment can suppress behavior short term
- Punishment does not teach a replacement behavior by itself
- Side effects and avoidance can occur

::: notes
Visual cue: Behavior drops, but no “replacement” appears automatically.
:::

## Shaping builds complex behavior

- Reinforce successive approximations
- Define clear criteria for “closer to target”
- Step by step changes accumulate

::: notes
Visual cue: Stair-step progression toward a target behavior.
:::

## Reinforcement schedules change patterns

- Fixed schedules produce more predictable responding
- Variable schedules can produce more persistent responding
- Patterns depend on schedule and context

::: notes
Visual cue: Predictable pattern vs persistent pattern mini graphs.
:::

## Observational learning

- Learn by watching a model
- Depends on attention and retention
- Depends on ability to reproduce and motivation

::: notes
Visual cue: Model → attention → memory → reproduction → motivation.
:::

## Vicarious consequences

- Observing outcomes changes imitation
- Consequences to others influence your behavior
- Modeling can change norms and expectations

::: notes
Visual cue: Model acts → consequence → observer chooses to imitate or not.
:::

## Latent learning and cognitive maps

- Learning can occur without immediate reinforcement
- Internal representations can guide later behavior
- Reinforcement can reveal learning rather than create it

::: notes
Visual cue: Maze map appears before a reward is introduced.
Guardrail: keep “internal representation” functional, not mystical.
:::

## Worked example: one behavior, three mechanisms

Example: avoiding dogs after a bite

:::: columns
::: column
Classical conditioning
- cues predict danger
- fear response becomes conditioned
:::

::: column
Operant conditioning
- avoidance reduces fear
- relief reinforces avoidance
:::

::: column
Observational learning
- watch others avoid
- modeling strengthens avoidance
:::
::::

::: notes
Teaching move: ask what intervention would target each mechanism.
:::

## Common confusions to avoid

- Negative reinforcement means punishment
- Reinforcement means reward
- Extinction means permanent erasure
- Observational learning requires direct reinforcement

::: notes
Use as a reset before retrieval.

## Quick check answers

- Habituation: reduced response after repeated exposure
- Classical conditioning: association between stimuli
- Operant conditioning: consequences shape behavior
- Negative reinforcement: remove something to increase behavior
- Punishment: consequence decreases behavior
- Extinction: conditioned response decreases when pairing stops
- Spontaneous recovery: conditioned response returns after time
- Generalization: response transfers to similar cues
- Discrimination: response becomes specific to one cue
- Observational learning: learning by watching others
- Latent learning: learning without immediate reinforcement
- Cognitive map: internal representation guiding later navigation

::: notes
Keep it brief. Do not re-lecture.

## Bridge to Topic 11

- Learning changes behavior through experience
- Memory explains how information is stored and retrieved
- Next: encoding, storage, retrieval, and reconstruction
