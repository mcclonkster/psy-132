## What this topic covers

- Personality as relatively stable patterns
- Trait approaches and the five-factor model
- Major theory families and assessment
- Person-situation interaction

::: notes
Visual cue: Traits + situation → behavior.
:::

## Personality is a pattern

- Patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving
- Consistency across time, with situational variation
- Probabilistic prediction, not certainty

::: notes
Guardrail: traits describe tendencies, not destiny.
:::

## Person and situation together

::: notes
Caption cue: situations can amplify or suppress trait expression.
:::

## Trait approach

- Describes dimensions of personality
- Predicts broad tendencies
- Depends on measurement quality

::: notes
Visual cue: Trait sliders.
:::

## Five-factor model

- Openness to experience
- Conscientiousness
- Extraversion
- Agreeableness
- Neuroticism

::: notes
Visual cue: Five labeled sliders.
Guardrail: avoid stereotypes and value judgments.
:::

## Openness

- interest in novelty and ideas
- preference for variety
- imagination and curiosity

::: notes
Visual cue: exploration icons.
:::

## Conscientiousness

- organization and follow-through
- self-control and planning
- reliability in routine demands

::: notes
Visual cue: plan → action → completion.
:::

## Extraversion

- social energy and engagement
- assertiveness and activity
- positive affect in social settings

::: notes
Visual cue: social engagement dial.
:::

## Agreeableness

- cooperation and trust
- empathy and warmth
- reduced conflict seeking

::: notes
Visual cue: collaboration icon.
:::

## Neuroticism

- sensitivity to negative emotion
- stress reactivity
- higher risk of distress under load

::: notes
Visual cue: stress reactivity dial.
Guardrail: not a diagnosis.
:::

## Temperament

- early reactivity differences
- early regulation differences
- some stability with change across development

::: notes
Visual cue: two dials labeled reactivity and regulation.
:::

## Situation strength

- strong situations constrain behavior
- weak situations allow more trait expression
- context improves prediction

::: notes
Visual cue: rules and constraints box shrinking behavior options.
Anchor: Mischel as a person-situation emphasis.
:::

## Major theory families

- Psychodynamic
- Humanistic
- Behavioral
- Social cognitive

::: notes
Visual cue: Four mechanism cards answering “why this pattern happens.”
:::

## Psychodynamic approaches

- emphasize unconscious processes and conflict
- highlight defense mechanisms and recurring themes
- evidence often comes from clinical patterns

::: notes
Guardrail: distinguish inference from direct observation.
Visual cue: theme across time → defensive pattern → behavior.
:::

## Humanistic approaches

- emphasize meaning and growth
- focus on self-concept
- highlight autonomy and values

::: notes
Visual cue: values → choices → growth path.
:::

## Behavioral approaches

- emphasize learning history
- reinforcement and punishment shape patterns
- environment change can change behavior

::: notes
Visual cue: antecedent → behavior → consequence loop.
:::

## Social cognitive approaches

- emphasize cognition in context
- expectations and goals matter
- person and environment influence each other

::: notes
Visual cue: reciprocal determinism triangle.
:::

## Reciprocal determinism

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
P[Person factors] <--> E[Environment]
E <--> B[Behavior]
B <--> P
```

::: notes
Caption cue: people shape environments and environments shape people over time.
:::

## Measuring personality

- tools vary in evidence quality
- good measures need reliability and validity
- interpretation depends on purpose

::: notes
Visual cue: tool → reliability → validity → interpretation.
:::

## Self-report inventories

- efficient summary of typical patterns
- vulnerable to social desirability
- limited by self-knowledge

::: notes
Visual cue: questionnaire → profile → interpretation limits.
:::

## Projective tests

- ambiguous stimuli invite interpretation
- scoring consistency can vary widely
- evidence support varies by method

::: notes
Guardrail: do not treat projective tests as uniformly evidence-based.
Visual cue: ambiguous stimulus → many interpretations → need strong scoring.
:::

## Personality is not diagnosis

- traits do not imply a disorder
- distress and impairment are separate questions
- keep boundaries clear with abnormal topics

::: notes
Visual cue: traits circle and disorder circle overlap but do not equal.
:::

## Worked example: behavior in two situations

Example: speaking up in class

- weak situation: more trait expression shows
- strong situation: rules and norms shape behavior
- both trait and context matter

::: notes
Teaching move: ask students to name one situational constraint and one trait tendency.
:::

## Common confusions to avoid

- traits determine behavior in all contexts
- one theory explains all personality
- all tests are equally accurate
- projective tests reveal hidden truth

::: notes
Use as a reset before retrieval.

## Quick check

Match the term to the best description

- Openness
- Conscientiousness
- Extraversion
- Agreeableness
- Neuroticism
- Situation strength
- Reciprocal determinism
- Self-report inventory
- Projective test

::: notes
Delivery: students commit first, then you reveal.
One discriminating cue per match.
:::

## Quick check answers

- Openness: interest in novelty and ideas
- Conscientiousness: planning and follow-through
- Extraversion: social engagement and energy
- Agreeableness: cooperation and trust
- Neuroticism: negative emotion sensitivity and stress reactivity
- Situation strength: rules and constraints limit behavioral options
- Reciprocal determinism: person, environment, and behavior influence each other
- Self-report inventory: questionnaire-based trait profile with self-report limits
- Projective test: ambiguous stimuli with variable scoring evidence

::: notes
Keep it brief. Do not re-lecture.

## Bridge to Topic 21

- Personality describes stable tendencies and patterns
- Gender involves identity, roles, and norms in context
- Next: gender-related development and social meaning

::: notes
Visual cue: traits and context feeding into identity and norms.
