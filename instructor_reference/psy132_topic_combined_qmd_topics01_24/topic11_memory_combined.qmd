## What this topic covers

- How information is encoded, stored, and retrieved
- How memory systems differ in function
- Why remembering is cue-dependent and reconstructive

::: notes
Visual cue: Encode → store → retrieve pipeline with “cues” feeding into retrieval.
:::

## Memory is not one single store

- Memory has multiple systems
- Memory includes multiple processes
- Remembering is not a literal recording

::: notes
Guardrail: confidence and vividness can increase without accuracy increasing.
:::

## Encode, store, retrieve

```{mermaid}

E[Encoding] --> S[Storage]
S --> R[Retrieval]
C[Cues and context] --> R
R --> P[Remembering and performance]
```

::: notes
Caption cue: retrieval depends on cues, not only on what was stored.
:::

## Encoding

- Encoding is getting information into memory
- Divided attention reduces later recall
- Deeper processing supports stronger memory

::: notes
Visual cue: Focused encoding lane vs divided encoding lane leading to different later recall.
:::

## Storage

- Storage is maintaining information over time
- Consolidation stabilizes memory over time
- Sleep can support consolidation

::: notes
Visual cue: Memory trace strengthening across time, with sleep as a support.
Guardrail: consolidation is a process over time, not instant locking.
:::

## Retrieval

- Retrieval is bringing information into awareness
- Retrieval can fail even when information was stored
- Retrieval improves when cues match encoding

::: notes
Visual cue: Same memory “box” with two different keys, only one fits.
:::

## A simple map of memory systems

```{mermaid}

M[Memory] --> SM[Sensory memory]
M --> WM[Working memory]
M --> LTM[Long-term memory]
LTM --> EX[Explicit]
LTM --> IM[Implicit]
EX --> EP[Episodic]
EX --> SE[Semantic]
IM --> PR[Procedural]
IM --> PM[Priming]
```

::: notes
Keep it big-picture. You will add detail later in cognition and learning.
:::

## Sensory memory

- Very brief storage of incoming input
- Supports continuity of experience
- Feeds later processing

::: notes
Visual cue: Incoming stream held briefly, then either lost or passed forward.
:::

## Working memory

- Holds information and works with it
- Limited capacity
- Depends on attentional control

::: notes
Visual cue: Small workspace with limited slots plus an attention spotlight.
Guardrail: avoid claiming one fixed “magic number” for everyone.
:::

## Long-term memory

- Durable storage
- Multiple systems with different evidence
- Retrieval depends on cues and context

::: notes
Visual cue: Library sections plus a search bar labeled cues.
:::

## Explicit and implicit memory

:::: columns
::: column
Explicit memory
- conscious recall
- episodic and semantic
- reportable in words
:::

::: column
Implicit memory
- without conscious recall
- skills and priming
- shown in performance
:::
::::

::: notes
Teaching move: ask for an example of a skill you can do without describing it well.
:::

## Episodic and semantic memory

- Episodic: events with time and place context
- Semantic: facts and concepts
- Both are explicit, but they behave differently

::: notes
Visual cue: Timeline of events vs concept map of knowledge.
:::

## Procedural memory and priming

- Procedural memory supports skills
- Priming is faster processing after prior exposure
- Learning can appear in performance without conscious recall

::: notes
Visual cue: Practice → smoother performance; prior exposure → faster response.
:::

## Retrieval cues

- Cues help locate stored information
- Stronger cues increase recall
- Weak cues produce retrieval failure

::: notes
Visual cue: Search bar returns more results when the cue is specific.
:::

## Encoding specificity and context

- Memory improves when cues match encoding
- Context can act as a cue
- Matches help retrieval, mismatches hurt retrieval

::: notes
Visual cue: Matching tags at encoding and retrieval.
:::

## Interference

- New learning can compete with old learning
- Old learning can compete with new learning
- Interference can look like forgetting

::: notes
Visual cue: Two similar items competing for one retrieval cue.
Example to say aloud: old password vs new password.
:::

## Reconstructive memory

- Memory is rebuilt during retrieval
- Gist is often stronger than details
- Later information can change reports

::: notes
Guardrail: reconstruction does not mean memory is useless, but it does mean memory is not a recording.
:::

## Misinformation effect

- Post-event information can alter reports
- Suggestive questions increase distortion risk
- Effects depend on conditions

::: notes
Visual cue: Event → post-event info → later report.
Keep claims conditional and evidence-based.
:::

## Source monitoring

- People can remember information but misattribute its source
- Familiarity can be mistaken for truth
- Repetition increases familiarity

::: notes
Visual cue: Two source icons with a misattribution arrow.
:::

## Consolidation and reconsolidation

- Consolidation stabilizes memory over time
- Retrieval can briefly reopen a memory for updating
- Updating is condition-dependent, not reliable erasure

::: notes
Guardrail: avoid “easy memory erasure” claims.
Visual cue: Memory trace stabilizes, then briefly opens during retrieval, then restabilizes.
:::

## Worked example: one story, multiple memory effects

Scenario: you witness a minor accident

- Encoding: divided attention reduces detail memory
- Retrieval cues: matching context improves recall
- Reconstruction: later conversation can reshape details

::: notes
Teaching move: ask students to identify one point where error is most likely and why.
:::

## Common confusions to avoid

- Memory is a literal recording
- Confidence guarantees accuracy
- Working memory equals long-term memory
- Forgetting means information was never stored

::: notes
Use as a reset before retrieval.

## Quick check answers

- Encoding: getting information into memory
- Storage: maintaining information over time
- Retrieval: bringing stored information into awareness
- Working memory: holding and manipulating information briefly
- Episodic memory: memory for events with context
- Semantic memory: memory for facts and concepts
- Procedural memory: memory for skills
- Priming: faster processing after prior exposure
- Encoding specificity: cues match encoding improve recall
- Interference: competing learning reduces recall
- Misinformation effect: post-event info alters reports
- Source monitoring: misattributing where information came from

::: notes
Keep explanations short and discriminating.

## Bridge to Topic 12

- Memory explains how information is stored and retrieved
- Cognition explains how people think, decide, and solve problems
- Next: concepts, heuristics, and reasoning
