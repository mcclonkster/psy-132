## What this topic covers

- How stress processes relate to health
- How coping and social support change outcomes
- How health behaviors and access shape risk and recovery

::: notes
Visual cue: Stress process → behavior and physiology → health outcomes, with context around it.
:::

## Health is multi-factor

- Biology matters
- Behavior matters
- Stress and context matter

::: notes
Guardrail: avoid one-to-one claims like “stress causes disease.”
:::

## Stress is a process

```

::: notes
Caption cue: the same stressor can produce different outcomes depending on appraisal and coping.
:::

## Appraisal shapes stress

- Meaning of the situation
- Perceived control
- Available resources

::: notes
Visual cue: Same event card leading to two different appraisals.
:::

## Acute and chronic stress

- Acute stress can support short-term action
- Chronic stress can increase long-term risk
- Effects depend on duration and context

::: notes
Visual cue: Short spike vs sustained activation.
:::

## Sympathetic and HPA pathways

:::: columns
::: column
Sympathetic pathway
- fast activation
- prepares action
- short time scale
:::

::: column
HPA axis pathway
- slower activation
- cortisol timing signals
- longer time scale
:::
::::

::: notes
Visual cue: Two-lane pathway diagram.
Guardrail: cortisol is not a single “stress level” meter.
:::

## Allostatic load

- Cumulative wear from repeated activation
- Multi-step pathway, not one marker
- Depends on measurement and timescale

::: notes
Visual cue: Repeated stress hits filling a “load” meter.
:::

## Psychoneuroimmunology

- Stress processes can influence immune-related outcomes
- Links are multi-factor and design-dependent
- Strong conclusions require careful evidence

::: notes
Guardrail: do not imply stress automatically causes a specific disease.
Visual cue: Stress process → behavior and physiology → immune-related outcomes.
:::

## Coping changes outcomes

- Coping is how you respond to demands
- Coping can change exposure and meaning
- Coping can change physiology and behavior

::: notes
Visual cue: Coping sits between appraisal and outcomes.
:::

## Problem-focused coping

- Targets the stressor or situation
- Planning and action steps
- Best fit when change is possible

::: notes
Visual cue: Stressor → plan → action.
:::

## Emotion-focused coping

- Targets emotion and meaning
- Reappraisal and acceptance
- Best fit when change is limited

::: notes
Visual cue: Stressor → new meaning → reduced distress.
Guardrail: emotion-focused coping is not avoidance by default.
:::

## Coping effectiveness is context-dependent

- Controllability matters
- Timing matters
- Costs and trade-offs matter

::: notes
Visual cue: Coping strategy card evaluated against a context card.
:::

## Social support buffers stress

- Increases resources
- Improves regulation
- Supports behavior change

::: notes
Visual cue: Social support as a buffer between stress and outcomes.
Guardrail: support can help through multiple pathways.
:::

## Resilience

- Adaptation under adversity
- Protective factors reduce risk
- Resilience is not invulnerability

::: notes
Visual cue: Risk factors and protective factors feeding into outcomes.
:::

## Health behaviors

- Sleep and recovery
- Physical activity
- Nutrition patterns
- Substance use

::: notes
Visual cue: Behavior set feeding into long-term outcomes.
:::

## Adherence

- Following a treatment plan over time
- Influenced by barriers and support
- Shaped by stress and resources

::: notes
Visual cue: Plan → barriers → adherence → outcomes.
:::

## Access and context matter

- Cost and time constraints matter
- Transportation and availability matter
- Language access and trust matter

::: notes
Guardrail: avoid “health is only personal responsibility” framing.
Visual cue: Context constraints around choices.
:::

## Type A and hostility

- Type A is not uniformly predictive
- Hostility is often a more specific risk-relevant component
- Evidence is mixed and context-dependent

::: notes
Visual cue: Type A umbrella with hostility highlighted.
Guardrail: avoid treating Type A as a single reliable predictor.
:::

## Biomarkers require caution

- Single markers are proxies
- Evidence is often correlational
- Interpretation depends on design and timescale

::: notes
Visual cue: Biomarker card stamped “proxy,” with confounds around it.
:::

## Worked example: stress and health behavior

Scenario: a demanding week

- Appraisal changes stress response
- Coping changes choices
- Sleep and activity change recovery

::: notes
Teaching move: ask students to name one problem-focused and one emotion-focused coping option for the scenario.
:::

## Common confusions to avoid

- Stress is only a feeling
- Stress automatically causes disease
- One coping style is always best
- Biomarkers prove simple answers

::: notes
Use as a reset before retrieval.

## Quick check

Match the term to the best description

- Appraisal
- Sympathetic pathway
- HPA axis
- Cortisol
- Allostatic load
- Problem-focused coping
- Emotion-focused coping
- Social support
- Adherence
- Resilience

::: notes
Delivery: students commit first, then you reveal.
One discriminating cue per match.
:::

## Quick check answers

- Appraisal: evaluation of meaning and control
- Sympathetic pathway: fast arousal mobilization
- HPA axis: slower stress pathway with cortisol timing signals
- Cortisol: hormone signal involved in stress timing and regulation
- Allostatic load: cumulative wear from repeated activation
- Problem-focused coping: actions to change the stressor
- Emotion-focused coping: actions to change emotion and meaning
- Social support: resource buffer that improves coping and behavior
- Adherence: following a treatment plan over time
- Resilience: adaptation under adversity, not invulnerability

::: notes
Keep it brief. Do not re-lecture.
:::

## Bridge to Topic 17

- Health behavior involves goals and persistence
- Motivation explains goal direction and effort
- Next: needs, incentives, goals, and self-regulation

::: notes
Visual cue: Health behavior feeding into motivation and self-regulation.
