## What this topic covers

- Distinctions among sex, gender identity, expression, and orientation
- Gender roles, norms, and socialization
- Stigma, minority stress, and well-being pathways
- Careful use of clinical terminology

::: notes
Visual cue: Four separate cards: sex, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation.
:::

## Separate the constructs

- Biological sex is about bodily characteristics and classifications
- Gender identity is an internal sense of self
- Gender expression is outward presentation and behavior
- Sexual orientation is patterns of attraction

::: notes
Guardrail: do not collapse these constructs into one.

S[Biological sex] --> D[Development and context]
GI[Gender identity] --> D
GE[Gender expression] --> D
SO[Sexual orientation] --> D
D --> E[Experience and outcomes]
```

::: notes
Caption cue: constructs are related but not identical, and context shapes outcomes.
:::

## Gender roles, norms, and stereotypes

- Gender roles are expected behaviors tied to categories
- Norms are shared rules about what is acceptable
- Stereotypes are beliefs about typical traits or behavior

::: notes
Visual cue: Role, norm, stereotype as three layers around a setting.
:::

## Gender schemas

- Schemas organize attention and interpretation
- Schemas shape what feels typical
- Schemas influence memory and judgment

::: notes
Visual cue: Schema as a filter highlighting “gender-consistent” cues.
Anchor: Bem as a common framework reference.
:::

## Socialization shapes norms over time

- Family and caregivers
- Peers and school contexts
- Media and online environments
- Institutions and cultural expectations

::: notes
Visual cue: Multiple inputs feeding into “what feels acceptable.”
:::

## Biological and social influences interact

- Biology contributes to development
- Social context contributes to development
- Single-cause explanations are usually inaccurate

::: notes
Visual cue: Two-way arrows between biology and social context across time.
:::

## Gender expression is diverse

- Expression does not map neatly onto stereotypes
- Expression varies by context and safety
- Expression can shift across settings

::: notes
Visual cue: Same person across settings with different expression, labeled context matters.
:::

## Common terms

- Cisgender: identity aligns with sex assigned at birth
- Transgender: identity differs from sex assigned at birth
- Nonbinary: identity outside strictly woman or man categories

::: notes
Visual cue: Three definitions in parallel format.
Guardrail: terms are identity descriptors, not diagnoses.
:::

## Stigma and discrimination

- Discrimination affects opportunity and safety
- Stigma increases chronic stress exposure
- Effects operate through stress and access pathways

::: notes
Visual cue: Stigma → stress load and access barriers → outcomes.
:::

## Minority stress

- Chronic stress from stigma-related experiences
- Anticipation of rejection can be stressful
- Concealment pressures can accumulate

::: notes
Visual cue: Repeated stressors filling a “load” meter over time.
Guardrail: minority stress is exposure pattern, not personal weakness.
:::

## Protective factors

- Social support and belonging
- Affirming environments
- Access to competent care

::: notes
Visual cue: Protective shields reducing risk pathway strength.
:::

## Clinical terminology requires care

- Clinical categories focus on distress and impairment
- Identity is not defined by diagnosis language
- Use precise, non-stigmatizing wording

::: notes
Visual cue: Identity language box separate from distress-language box.
:::

## Gender dysphoria

- Distress related to incongruence can occur for some people
- Distress is the focus of the clinical category
- Support aims to reduce distress and impairment

::: notes
Guardrail: avoid implying gender diversity itself is pathological.
:::

## Case caution

- Do not treat any one case as decisive proof
- Many cases involve confounds and ethical limits
- Use cautious conclusions

::: notes
If a case like David Reimer is mentioned, frame it as ethically and methodologically limited, not as a clean experiment.
:::

## Worked example: identifying the construct

Scenario: “I avoid wearing this at school because I will be judged.”

- Identity is about internal sense of self
- Expression is outward presentation
- Norms and safety change what is feasible

::: notes
Teaching move: ask students to label which construct is being described and why.
:::

## Common confusions to avoid

- Sex and gender are identical
- Gender identity equals sexual orientation
- Socialization is the only influence
- Biology is the only influence
- Diagnostic terms define identity

::: notes
Use as a reset before retrieval.

## Quick check

Match the term to the best description

- Biological sex
- Gender identity
- Gender expression
- Sexual orientation
- Gender role
- Gender stereotype
- Socialization
- Discrimination
- Minority stress
- Gender dysphoria

::: notes
Delivery: students commit first, then you reveal.
One discriminating cue per match.
:::

## Quick check answers

- Biological sex: bodily characteristics and classifications
- Gender identity: internal sense of gender
- Gender expression: outward presentation and behavior
- Sexual orientation: patterns of attraction
- Gender role: expected behavior tied to a category
- Gender stereotype: belief about typical traits or behavior
- Socialization: learning norms through interaction and feedback
- Discrimination: unequal treatment and barriers
- Minority stress: chronic stress from stigma-related exposures
- Gender dysphoria: distress and impairment related to incongruence

::: notes
Keep explanations short and discriminating.
:::

## Bridge to Topic 22

- Gender shows how social meaning shapes experience
- Culture shapes what is treated as typical and acceptable
- Next: multicultural psychology and cultural variability

::: notes
Visual cue: One concept shown across multiple cultural frames.
