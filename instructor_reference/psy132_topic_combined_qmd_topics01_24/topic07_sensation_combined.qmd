## What this topic covers

- How sensory systems detect physical energy
- How transduction turns energy into neural signals
- How thresholds, adaptation, and basic coding work

::: notes
Visual cue: Stimulus energy → receptor → neural signal → basic feature code.
:::

## Sensation is detection and encoding

- Sensation begins with physical energy
- Receptors respond to specific energy types
- The nervous system encodes basic features

::: notes
Guardrail: sensation is not interpretation. Interpretation is perception.
:::

## Transduction is the key step

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
E[Physical energy] --> R[Receptor]
R --> N[Neural signal]
N --> C[Feature code]
```

::: notes
Caption cue: transduction converts energy into neural activity.
:::

## Thresholds describe detection limits

- Absolute threshold: smallest detectable signal under defined conditions
- Difference threshold: smallest detectable change
- Thresholds depend on noise and decision criteria

::: notes
Visual cue: Signal bar with a detection line.
Guardrail: thresholds are not fixed personal limits.
:::

## Weber’s law

- Perceived change depends on proportion
- Larger baselines require larger changes to notice
- Difference thresholds scale with intensity

::: notes
Visual cue: Two bars showing equal proportional changes that feel equally noticeable.
:::

## Sensory adaptation

- Responsiveness decreases with constant stimulation
- Adaptation increases sensitivity to change
- Adaptation does not mean input disappears

::: notes
Visual cue: Constant stimulus with declining response curve.
:::

## Signal detection reminder

- Sensitivity reflects ability to detect a signal
- Criterion reflects the decision threshold
- Context and costs can shift criterion

::: notes
Visual cue: Two dials labeled Sensitivity and Criterion affecting “Detected.”
Keep it simple; full treatment appears again in perception.
:::

## Vision starts in the retina

- Rods: low-light sensitivity
- Cones: detail and color
- Receptors specialize for different conditions

::: notes
Visual cue: Retina sketch labeling rods and cones.
:::

## Color coding uses multiple mechanisms

- Trichromatic coding supports early color processing
- Opponent coding supports contrast processing
- Mechanisms operate at different stages

::: notes
Visual cue: Three inputs → opponent channels diagram.
Guardrail: do not present one theory as replacing the other.
:::

## Hearing starts with sound energy

- Sound is pressure variation over time
- Frequency supports pitch perception
- Amplitude supports loudness perception

::: notes
Visual cue: Wave with frequency and amplitude labeled.
:::

## How the ear represents frequency

- Place cues: different locations respond to different frequencies
- Timing cues: firing patterns support frequency information
- Cochlear mechanics constrain both

::: notes
Visual cue: Unrolled cochlea with a place gradient plus a timing cue.
Keep language: “cues,” not “one correct theory.”
:::

## Touch and body-position senses

- Mechanoreceptors detect pressure and vibration
- Thermoreceptors detect temperature change
- Proprioception supports body position awareness
- Vestibular sense supports balance

::: notes
Visual cue: Body outline with sensors at skin, joints, inner ear.
:::

## Nociception and pain are not identical

- Nociception detects potentially harmful stimuli
- Pain experience depends on perception and context
- The same input can feel different across situations

::: notes
Visual cue: Nociceptor input → brain processing → reported experience.
Guardrail: avoid “pain is only in your head” framing.
:::

## Sensation versus perception

:::: columns
::: column
Sensation
- detect and encode
- basic features
- transduction and thresholds
:::

::: column
Perception
- organize and interpret
- meaning and context
- bottom-up and top-down interaction
:::
::::

::: notes
Visual cue: Two-step pipeline: sensation → perception.
This slide sets the boundary for Topic 8.
:::

## Worked example: same stimulus, different experience

- The stimulus can stay the same
- Attention and context can change the experience
- Interpretation begins in perception

::: notes
Visual cue: Same stimulus card with two different context frames.
Use a simple example aloud: a cold pool versus an ice pack, or a loud sound in a concert versus in class.

## Quick check answers

- Transduction: energy becomes neural activity
- Absolute threshold: smallest detectable signal under defined conditions
- Difference threshold: smallest detectable change
- Weber’s law: change is noticed by proportion

- Rod: receptor supporting low-light sensitivity
- Cone: receptor supporting detail and color
- Place cue: frequency information from cochlear location
- Proprioception: sense of body position
- Vestibular sense: sense of balance
- Nociception: detection of potentially harmful stimuli

::: notes
Keep it brief. Do not re-lecture.
