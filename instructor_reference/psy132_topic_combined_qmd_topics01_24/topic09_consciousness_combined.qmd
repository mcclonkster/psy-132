## What this topic covers

- Consciousness as measurable awareness
- Biological rhythms and sleep architecture
- Psychoactive drugs and selected altered states

::: notes
Visual cue: Awareness across time and states: day-night rhythm, sleep stages, substances, attention practices.
:::

## Consciousness is studied through evidence

- Awareness is described and measured
- Physiology and behavior provide signals
- Interpretation depends on method limits

::: notes
Guardrail: consciousness is not defined by one measure alone.
:::

## Biological rhythms organize alertness

- Circadian timing shapes sleep and wake
- Light is a major timing cue
- Rhythms shift across development and context

::: notes
Visual cue: 24-hour cycle with alertness curve and light cue.
:::

## Circadian timing system

T --> M[Melatonin timing]
```

::: notes
Guardrail: keep causation language cautious and timing-focused.
:::

## Measuring sleep

- Sleep staging uses physiological indicators
- EEG is a common signal source
- Sleep is not staged by feeling alone

::: notes
Visual cue: EEG trace panel with stage labels.
:::

## Sleep architecture

- Sleep cycles across the night
- Non-REM and REM differ in patterns
- Cycles repeat multiple times

::: notes
Visual cue: Hypnogram-style timeline with repeating cycles.
Guardrail: avoid presenting exact timing as fixed for all people.
:::

## Non-REM sleep

- Includes multiple stages
- Deeper stages are more common earlier in the night
- Sleep spindles are a key feature in one stage

::: notes
Visual cue: NREM block with a spindle callout.
:::

## REM sleep

- Distinct physiology pattern
- More common later in the night
- Dreaming is not identical to REM sleep

::: notes
Visual cue: REM block plus a separate “dreaming” bubble spanning more than one stage.
:::

## Sleep loss affects functioning

- Attention and performance decrease
- Mood and regulation can worsen
- Errors and lapses increase

::: notes
Visual cue: Attention and mood dials shifting with fewer hours of sleep.
Keep claims practical and cautious.
:::

## Sleep disorders overview

- Insomnia: persistent sleep difficulty
- Sleep apnea: breathing interruptions and disrupted sleep
- Narcolepsy: sudden sleep episodes and REM intrusion patterns

::: notes
Visual cue: Three disorder cards with one defining feature each.
Guardrail: avoid self-diagnosis framing.
:::

## Psychoactive drugs

- Psychoactive drugs alter consciousness
- Effects depend on dose, setting, and person factors
- Risk varies by substance and situation

::: notes
Safety guardrail: keep discussion descriptive and non-instructional.
:::

## Tolerance, dependence, withdrawal

- Tolerance: reduced effect at the same dose over time
- Dependence: adaptation with withdrawal risk if stopped
- Withdrawal: symptoms after reducing or stopping

::: notes
Guardrail: dependence is not identical to addiction.
:::

## Broad drug categories

- Depressants
- Stimulants
- Opioids
- Hallucinogens

::: notes
Guardrail: categories are broad groupings; substances within a group can differ.
:::

## Depressants

- Reduce central nervous system activity
- Can impair coordination and judgment
- Risk increases when combined with other depressants

::: notes
Guardrail: depressant does not mean sadness.
:::

## Stimulants

- Increase alertness and activation
- Can disrupt sleep and increase jitteriness
- Risk increases with dose and vulnerability

::: notes
Visual cue: Alertness dial up, sleep dial down.
:::

## Opioids

- Act on pain and reward pathways
- Can slow breathing and increase overdose risk
- Dependence risk can be high

::: notes
Safety guardrail: emphasize impairment and overdose risk without use guidance.
:::

## Hallucinogens

- Alter perception and experience
- Effects depend strongly on context and individual factors
- Risks include panic reactions and unsafe behavior under impairment

::: notes
Safety guardrail: focus on impairment and context sensitivity.
:::

## Hypnosis

- Focused attention and responsiveness to suggestion
- Expectation and context matter
- Hypnosis is not mind control

::: notes
Visual cue: Attention spotlight plus suggestion arrow.
Guardrail: avoid “mind control” framing.
:::

## Two interpretations of hypnosis

:::: columns
::: column
Dissociation accounts
- divided awareness
- automatic responding
:::

::: column
Response expectancy accounts
- expectation effects
- role and context
:::
::::

::: notes
Guardrail: hypnosis is not universally agreed to be one distinct state.
:::

## Meditation

- Practices that train attention and awareness
- Effects depend on practice type and context
- Often involves self-regulation skills

::: notes
Visual cue: Attention spotlight becoming steadier over time.
Guardrail: avoid overpromising effects.
:::

## Common confusions to avoid

- Dreaming equals REM sleep
- Depressant means sadness
- Hypnosis equals mind control
- Category labels guarantee one simple drug effect

::: notes
Use as a reset before retrieval.

## Quick check

Match the term to the best description

- Circadian rhythm
- Suprachiasmatic nucleus
- Melatonin
- EEG
- REM sleep
- Non-REM sleep
- Sleep spindle
- Tolerance
- Dependence
- Withdrawal

::: notes
Delivery: students commit first, then you reveal.
One discriminating cue per match.
:::

## Quick check answers

- Circadian rhythm: roughly daily timing pattern
- Suprachiasmatic nucleus: timing coordinator for circadian rhythms
- Melatonin: timing-related hormone signal associated with sleep
- EEG: electrical activity measure used in sleep staging
- REM sleep: stage with distinct physiology and more late-night proportion
- Non-REM sleep: stages with deeper sleep more early in the night
- Sleep spindle: brief burst pattern in one non-REM stage
- Tolerance: reduced effect at the same dose over time
- Dependence: adaptation with withdrawal risk if stopped
- Withdrawal: symptoms after reducing or stopping

::: notes
Keep explanations short and discriminating.
:::

## Bridge to Topic 10

- Consciousness changes across sleep and waking
- Learning changes behavior through experience
- Next: how association and consequences shape behavior

::: notes
Visual cue: State and attention feeding into learning capacity.
