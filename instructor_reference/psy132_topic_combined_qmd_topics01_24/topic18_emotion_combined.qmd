## What this topic covers

- Components of emotion
- Major theories of emotion
- Emotion regulation strategies and trade-offs
- How emotion interacts with cognition and behavior

::: notes
Visual cue: Emotion episode with four components, then regulation choices.
:::

## Emotion has multiple components

- Arousal in the body
- Appraisal of meaning
- Subjective experience
- Expression and action tendencies

::: notes
Visual cue: Four-part wheel labeled arousal, appraisal, experience, expression.
Guardrail: avoid treating emotion as only a feeling or only physiology.
:::

## Emotion episode model

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
S[Situation] --> A[Appraisal]
A --> AR[Arousal]
A --> E[Experience]
A --> EX[Expression]
AR --> B[Behavior]
E --> B
EX --> B
```

::: notes
Caption cue: appraisal shapes arousal, experience, and expression, which shape behavior.
:::

## Arousal

- Physiological activation
- Can look similar across different emotions
- Context helps label arousal

::: notes
Visual cue: Same arousal meter paired with two different situation cards.
Example to say aloud: excitement versus anxiety.
:::

## Appraisal

- Evaluation of meaning
- Influences which emotion occurs
- Can be fast and automatic

::: notes
Visual cue: Same event → two appraisals → two emotions.
:::

## Expression

- Face, voice, posture, and action
- Signals to others
- Shaped by context and culture

::: notes
Guardrail: avoid claiming expression is fully universal or fully culture-specific.
Visual cue: Expression channels as icons.
:::

## Display rules

- Norms for when and how to show emotion
- Public expression can differ from private experience
- Audience and setting matter

::: notes
Visual cue: Same emotion episode with different public display choices.
:::

## Theories emphasize different timing and mechanisms

- Theories are models, not final answers
- They emphasize different sequences
- Useful comparison focuses on what comes first

::: notes
Visual cue: Three timelines for the classic theories.
:::

## Three classic theories compared

```{mermaid}
flowchart TB
JL[James-Lange] --> JL1[Situation → arousal → emotion experience]
CB[Cannon-Bard] --> CB1[Situation → arousal and experience together]
TF[Two-factor] --> TF1[Situation → arousal + label → emotion experience]
```

::: notes
Guardrail: treat these as simplified teaching models.
:::

## James-Lange theory

- Bodily arousal comes first
- Experience follows bodily changes
- Different patterns support different labels

::: notes
Visual cue: Situation → arousal → label.
:::

## Cannon-Bard theory

- Arousal and experience occur together
- Emotion is not dependent on one bodily sequence first
- Central processing coordinates responses

::: notes
Visual cue: Situation → arousal and experience simultaneously.
Guardrail: keep brain claims network-based.
:::

## Two-factor theory

- Arousal plus cognitive label
- Label depends on context
- Similar arousal can become different emotions

::: notes
Visual cue: Arousal + context → label.
Example to say aloud: excitement versus anxiety.
:::

## Appraisal approaches

- Meaning drives emotion differences
- Goals and control shape appraisal
- Appraisal changes intensity and type

::: notes
Visual cue: Appraisal questions: what is at stake, can I cope, who caused this.
:::

## Emotion regulation

- Regulation changes experience or expression
- Strategies differ in trade-offs
- Effectiveness depends on context

::: notes
Visual cue: Emotion episode timeline with decision points.
Guardrail: strategies are not universally good or bad.
:::

## Reappraisal

- Changes interpretation of the situation
- Can reduce negative emotion intensity
- Often reduces downstream costs

::: notes
Visual cue: Situation → new meaning → reduced intensity.
:::

## Suppression

- Reduces visible expression
- Does not necessarily reduce inner experience
- Can increase effort or stress in some contexts

::: notes
Visual cue: Expression turned down while internal load remains.
Guardrail: suppression is one strategy, not “emotion regulation” as a whole.
:::

## Emotion influences cognition

- Emotion shapes attention
- Emotion shapes memory
- Emotion shapes judgment and social behavior

::: notes
Visual cue: Emotion episode feeding into attention filter and memory encoding strength.
:::

## Worked example: test anxiety

- Appraisal: “This is a threat”
- Arousal: activation increases
- Label: anxiety increases avoidance urges
- Regulation: reappraisal and preparation can change outcomes

::: notes
Teaching move: ask students to propose a reappraisal statement that is believable, not overly positive.
:::

## Common confusions to avoid

- Emotion is only feeling
- One theory explains all emotions
- Suppression is the same as regulation
- Arousal uniquely identifies a specific emotion

::: notes
Use as a reset before retrieval.

## Quick check

Match the term to the best description

- Arousal
- Appraisal
- Display rule
- James-Lange theory
- Cannon-Bard theory
- Two-factor theory
- Reappraisal
- Suppression
- Action tendency

::: notes
Delivery: students commit first, then you reveal.
One discriminating cue per match.
:::

## Quick check answers

- Arousal: physiological activation
- Appraisal: evaluation of meaning and control
- Display rule: norm for expression in context
- James-Lange theory: arousal first, then experience
- Cannon-Bard theory: arousal and experience together
- Two-factor theory: arousal plus label
- Reappraisal: change interpretation to change emotion
- Suppression: reduce expression without necessarily reducing experience
- Action tendency: impulse toward a behavior linked to emotion

::: notes
Keep it brief. Do not re-lecture.
:::

## Bridge to Topic 19

- Emotion occurs in social contexts
- People interpret others using emotion cues
- Next: social influence and social cognition

::: notes
Visual cue: One interaction with emotion cues feeding into interpretation.

- A regulation example where reappraisal changes intensity or behavior
- One limitation example, such as sleep deprivation increasing irritability independent of situation meaning
