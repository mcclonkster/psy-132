## What this topic covers

- How people form concepts and categories
- How people solve problems and make decisions
- Why shortcuts can help and also create predictable errors

::: notes
Visual cue: Categorize → solve → decide pipeline.
:::

## Cognition is thinking in action

- Cognition organizes information
- Cognition guides decisions
- Cognition is efficient, not perfect

::: notes
Guardrail: biases are context-dependent patterns, not proof of general laziness or low intelligence.
:::

## From information to judgment

```{mermaid}

I[Information] --> R[Representation]
R --> S[Strategy]
S --> J[Judgment and choice]
J --> F[Feedback]
F --> R
```

::: notes
Caption cue: how you represent a problem changes what strategies you use.
:::

## Concepts and categories

- Concepts are mental representations
- Categories group related items
- Categories guide expectations

::: notes
Visual cue: Many items grouped into one labeled category.
:::

## Prototypes

- Prototype: a typical category example
- Typicality influences speed and confidence
- Typical does not mean correct

::: notes
Visual cue: Category center labeled prototype, less typical examples farther away.
Example to say aloud: robin versus penguin as birds.
:::

## Exemplars

- Exemplar: a remembered specific example
- Judgments can use stored examples
- Salient examples can dominate

::: notes
Visual cue: Multiple stored examples feeding into a new judgment.
Guardrail: vivid examples can distort perceived frequency.
:::

## Schemas and scripts

- Schemas organize knowledge
- Scripts are schemas for familiar sequences
- Schemas shape perception, memory, and judgment

::: notes
Visual cue: Schema as a folder; script as a timeline inside the folder.
:::

## Problem representation matters

- Same problem, different frame
- Different frame, different solution
- Reframing can reveal options

::: notes
Visual cue: One problem shown two ways, with one pathway becoming visible after reframing.
:::

## Algorithms and heuristics

:::: columns
::: column
Algorithm
- step-by-step procedure
- systematic search
- can guarantee a solution in principle
:::

::: column
Heuristic
- efficient shortcut
- works under uncertainty
- can create predictable bias
:::
::::

::: notes
Visual cue: Two routes: thorough versus fast.
Guardrail: heuristics are not automatically irrational.
:::

## Availability heuristic

- Likelihood judged by ease of recall
- Vivid examples feel more common
- Recent and media-salient events distort estimates

::: notes
Visual cue: Easy-to-recall examples appear larger than hard-to-recall examples.
:::

## Anchoring

- Start from an initial number
- Adjust too little from the start
- Estimates drift toward the anchor

::: notes
Visual cue: Anchor number pulling later estimates toward it.
:::

## Representativeness heuristic

- Likelihood judged by similarity to a prototype
- Base rates can be ignored
- Similarity can feel like probability

::: notes
Visual cue: Prototype match meter overpowering base-rate info.
Teaching move: define base rates as “how common it is overall.”
:::

## Confirmation bias

- Prefer information that fits existing beliefs
- Interpret ambiguous evidence as supportive
- Stronger when stakes are high

::: notes
Visual cue: Filter icon letting in confirming evidence.
Keep it descriptive, not moral.
:::

## Hindsight bias

- Outcome makes the past feel predictable
- Memory for prediction shifts toward the outcome
- Confidence increases without accuracy increasing

::: notes
Visual cue: Before prediction and after remembered prediction, with a drift arrow.
:::

## Framing effect

- Equivalent options feel different
- Gains and losses shift preferences
- Wording can change decisions without changing facts

::: notes
Visual cue: “90 percent survival” and “10 percent mortality” shown as equivalent.
:::

## Mental set and functional fixedness

- Mental set: default strategy blocks alternatives
- Functional fixedness: usual object use blocks new uses
- Reframing can reduce both

::: notes
Visual cue: One well-worn path plus an alternative path; common object with a new use revealed.
:::

## Automatic and controlled processing

- Automatic responses are fast and effortless
- Controlled processing requires attention and effort
- Automatic responses can interfere with control

::: notes
Visual cue: Two tracks, fast and slow, with an interference arrow.
Anchor example: Stroop task.
:::

## Metacognition

- Monitoring your own thinking
- Regulating strategies and effort
- Detecting errors and limits

::: notes
Visual cue: “thinking dashboard” with confidence and error signals.
:::

## Worked example: one decision, multiple biases

Scenario: deciding whether something is dangerous

- Availability: vivid story feels common
- Representativeness: similarity feels like probability
- Anchoring: first number pulls estimates

::: notes
Teaching move: ask what information would reduce each bias in the scenario.
:::

## Common confusions to avoid

- Heuristics are always bad
- Bias equals laziness
- Confidence guarantees accuracy
- Logic is always natural and automatic

::: notes
Use as a reset before retrieval.

::: notes
Keep explanations short and discriminating.

## Bridge to Topic 13

- Cognition explains thinking and decision processes
- Intelligence asks how ability is defined and measured
- Next: psychometrics, norms, and interpretation limits

::: notes
Visual cue: Thinking processes feeding into measurement questions.
