## What this topic covers

- Development across physical, cognitive, and psychosocial domains
- How biology, experience, and context interact over time
- Key frameworks and common misconceptions about development

::: notes
Visual cue: Life-span timeline with three tracks: physical, cognitive, psychosocial.
:::

## Development is change over time

- Development involves gains and losses
- Change can be gradual or stage-like
- Variation is expected

::: notes
Guardrail: avoid “one path fits everyone” narratives.
:::

## A simple development model

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
B[Biology] --> D[Development]
E[Experience] --> D
C[Context] --> D
D --> O[Outcomes]
O --> D
```

::: notes
Caption cue: development is an ongoing interaction, not a one-time cause.
:::

## Nature and nurture interact

- Both contribute to outcomes
- Interaction is common
- Either-or stories miss mechanisms

::: notes
Visual cue: Two inputs blending, with a context frame around them.
:::

## Continuity and discontinuity

:::: columns
::: column
Continuity
- gradual change
- small steps accumulate
:::

::: column
Discontinuity
- stage-like shifts
- qualitative changes
:::
::::

::: notes
Visual cue: Smooth curve vs step curve.
Guardrail: pattern depends on domain and measurement.
:::

## Prenatal development

- Rapid biological change
- Sensitive periods
- Environmental vulnerability

::: notes
Visual cue: Prenatal timeline with “rapid change” highlighted.
:::

## Teratogens

- Teratogen: exposure that can increase risk
- Effects depend on timing
- Effects depend on dose and context

::: notes
Visual cue: Timing and dose sliders affecting risk.
Guardrail: avoid single-cause claims.
:::

## Infancy: temperament

- Early differences in reactivity
- Early differences in regulation
- Some stability and some change

::: notes
Visual cue: Two dials labeled reactivity and regulation.
:::

## Attachment

- Early relationship pattern
- Responsiveness matters
- Influence without guarantee

::: notes
Visual cue: Responsiveness → secure base behavior → later outcomes (dashed line).
Guardrail: attachment categories are not destiny.
:::

## Parenting styles as patterns

- Warmth and responsiveness
- Control and structure
- Consistent interaction style

::: notes
Visual cue: Two-axis warmth-control matrix.
:::

## Parenting styles

```{mermaid}
quadrantChart
title Warmth and control patterns
x-axis Low control --> High control
y-axis Low warmth --> High warmth
quadrant-1 Authoritative
quadrant-2 Permissive
quadrant-3 Authoritarian
quadrant-4 Uninvolved
```

::: notes
Guardrail: associations are probabilistic and context-dependent.
:::

## Cognitive development

- Thinking changes with age and experience
- Education and practice matter
- Culture and context matter

::: notes
Visual cue: Thinking tools becoming more flexible across time.
Guardrail: avoid rigid age cutoffs.
:::

## Adolescence

- Puberty and biological change
- Identity development
- Peer and social context shifts

::: notes
Visual cue: Puberty timeline plus identity exploration arrows.
Guardrail: avoid “adolescence is always turbulent” claims.
:::

## Peer context and risk

- Peers can increase risk-taking in some contexts
- Incentives and social goals matter
- Effects vary across people and situations

::: notes
Visual cue: Same choice alone vs with peers.
:::

## Emerging adulthood

- Transition period in some societies
- Role exploration and instability
- Variation across culture and context

::: notes
Visual cue: Bridge between adolescence and adulthood with multiple pathways.
:::

## Aging

- Some abilities change more than others
- Health and context shape trajectories
- Knowledge often remains strong

::: notes
Visual cue: Two lines: speed-based skills shift more; knowledge-based skills remain stable or grow.
Guardrail: avoid “uniform decline” narratives.
:::

## Culture and cohort

- Norms and timing vary across cultures
- Historical cohorts differ in opportunities
- Context shapes “typical” patterns

::: notes
Visual cue: Two cohorts with different environmental contexts.
:::

## Bereavement and grief

- Bereavement is the loss context
- Grief responses vary widely
- Stage models can mislead if treated as fixed sequences

::: notes
Guardrail: grief does not follow a fixed sequence for all people.
Visual cue: Multiple grief trajectories rather than a single stage ladder.
:::

## Worked example: one milestone, multiple influences

Example: academic performance in adolescence

- Biology: sleep timing shifts can affect attention
- Experience: practice and feedback build skills
- Context: resources and expectations shape outcomes

::: notes
Teaching move: ask students to name one protective factor in each category.
:::

## Common confusions to avoid

- Development is mostly genetics
- Development is mostly parenting
- Stages are universal and fixed
- Aging means inevitable severe decline

::: notes
Use as a reset before retrieval.

::: notes
Delivery: students commit first, then you reveal.
One discriminating cue per match.
:::

## Quick check answers

- Teratogen: exposure that can increase developmental risk
- Temperament: early reactivity and regulation differences
- Attachment: early relationship pattern influencing secure base behavior
- Authoritative parenting: high warmth with high structure
- Continuity: gradual developmental change
- Discontinuity: stage-like developmental shifts
- Cohort: group shaped by shared historical time and context
- Emerging adulthood: transition period with role exploration in some settings
- Bereavement: loss context
- Grief: response pattern that varies widely after loss

::: notes
Keep it brief. Do not re-lecture.
