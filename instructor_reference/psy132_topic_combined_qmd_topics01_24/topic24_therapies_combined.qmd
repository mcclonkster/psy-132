## What this topic covers

- Major treatment approaches
- Evidence-based practice and outcome evaluation
- Matching care to needs, context, and access
- Common confusions about treatment

::: notes
Visual cue: Approach + evidence + fit triangle.
:::

## Treatment includes multiple approaches

- Psychotherapy
- Medication
- Combined care

::: notes
Guardrail: one approach is not best for all problems.
Visual cue: Three pathways feeding into one plan.
:::

## Evidence-based practice

```{mermaid}
flowchart TB
E[Best research evidence] --> P[Practice decision]
C[Clinical expertise] --> P
V[Patient values and context] --> P
```

::: notes
Caption cue: evidence-based practice integrates evidence, expertise, and values in context.
:::

## What outcomes we judge

- Symptom reduction
- Functional improvement
- Quality of life

::: notes
Visual cue: Three outcome bars that can change independently.
:::

## Efficacy and effectiveness

:::: columns
::: column
Efficacy
- works in controlled studies
- strong internal validity
:::

::: column
Effectiveness
- works in routine settings
- context and access matter
:::
::::

::: notes
Visual cue: Controlled trial vs routine care setting.
Guardrail: do not assume trial results transfer perfectly.
:::

## Matching care to needs

- Severity and risk
- Comorbidity
- Functional impairment
- Preference and access constraints

::: notes
Visual cue: Triage board: risk, impairment, comorbidity, access.
:::

## Psychotherapy targets patterns and skills

- Approaches differ in mechanisms
- Skill practice is often central
- Common factors also matter

::: notes
Visual cue: Skills practice cycle: learn, practice, apply, review.
:::

## Common factors

- Therapeutic alliance
- Expectations and hope
- Structure and practice

::: notes
Guardrail: common factors do not mean technique never matters.
:::

## Therapeutic alliance

- Shared goals
- Agreement on tasks
- Collaborative relationship

::: notes
Visual cue: Client and therapist linking goals, tasks, bond.
:::

## Major psychotherapy approaches

- Behavioral therapy
- Cognitive therapy
- Cognitive behavioral therapy
- Psychodynamic therapy
- Humanistic and client-centered therapy
- Group and family therapy

::: notes
Visual cue: Menu of approaches with one mechanism keyword you say aloud for each.
:::

## Behavioral therapy and exposure

- Targets avoidance and behavior patterns
- Uses learning principles
- Exposure reduces avoidance that maintains fear

::: notes
Visual cue: Fear cue → safe exposure → reduced avoidance loop.
Guardrail: exposure is planned, gradual, and monitored.
:::

## Cognitive therapy and CBT

- Cognitive therapy targets thought patterns
- CBT targets thought-behavior cycles
- Practice supports generalization

::: notes
Visual cue: Situation → thought → emotion → behavior cycle with tools.
:::

## Psychodynamic and humanistic approaches

- Psychodynamic emphasizes recurring themes and conflict
- Humanistic emphasizes meaning and self-concept
- Approaches differ in goals and methods

::: notes
Visual cue: Two cards with themes and values highlighted.
Guardrail: keep claims tied to goals and evidence, not certainty.
:::

## Group and family therapy

- Groups provide support and practice
- Family therapy targets interaction cycles
- Context can maintain problems

::: notes
Visual cue: Group circle and family interaction loop.
Guardrail: confidentiality limits exist in groups.
:::

## Medication

- Can reduce symptom intensity for some conditions
- Effects depend on condition and person factors
- Often paired with psychosocial support

::: notes
Guardrail: medication is not a single “cure” for underlying causes.
Visual cue: Symptom dial reduced plus skills and support lane.
:::

## Placebo and expectancy effects

- Context and expectations can contribute to outcomes
- Improvement is not fake
- Effects do not mean all treatments are equivalent

::: notes
Visual cue: Expectancy lane alongside active mechanism lane.
:::

## Stepped care

- Start with appropriate intensity
- Adjust based on response
- Combine approaches when indicated

::: notes
Visual cue: Step ladder with an adjust loop.
:::

## Access and structural barriers

- Cost and insurance
- Availability and wait times
- Transportation and scheduling
- Language access and trust

::: notes
Visual cue: Barriers funnel reducing entry to care.
:::

## Worked example: choosing a plan

Scenario: panic symptoms and avoidance

- Evidence suggests exposure-based CBT can help
- Medication may reduce intensity for some people
- Choice depends on severity, preference, and access

::: notes
Teaching move: ask students which decision factors change the plan (risk, comorbidity, resources).
:::

## Common confusions to avoid

- One therapy works best for everything
- Common factors mean technique never matters
- Medication always fixes the cause
- “Works in a study” guarantees the same outcome for everyone

::: notes
Use as a reset before retrieval.

::: notes
Delivery: students commit first, then you reveal.
One discriminating cue per match.
:::

## Quick check answers

- Evidence-based practice: integrate evidence, expertise, and values
- Efficacy: works in controlled studies
- Effectiveness: works in routine settings
- Therapeutic alliance: goals, tasks, and collaboration
- Common factors: shared contributors across therapies
- Exposure: planned contact that reduces avoidance
- Cognitive behavioral therapy: skills targeting thought-behavior cycles
- Stepped care: adjust intensity based on response
- Placebo effects: context and expectations contribute to outcomes

::: notes
Keep it brief. Do not re-lecture.
:::

## Course close

- Use methods to judge claims
- Use context to interpret results
- Use evidence and fit to choose actions

::: notes
Visual cue: Evidence, context, and fit as the course wrap triad.
