## Biopsychology: Why It Matters

- Behavior has biological roots
- Biology is not destiny
- This is a toolkit, not trivia

::: notes
- Talk track: Students will keep using biology talk to explain behavior. We want to give them real tools.
:::

## Discussion

Where do you see people use biology to explain behavior, and when does it help versus excuse?  
*If you want a lane: school stress, mental health talk, social media claims, “wired this way”*  

**Takeaway**: Biopsychology explains behavior with biology without turning it into destiny or excuses.

::: notes
- Aim: Keep the lane on explanation versus excuse, not confession.
- Entry ramp: People reach for biology language when they feel stuck or ashamed.
- If quiet: What is a claim you have heard that sounds too simple?
- Guardrail: No personal disclosure required. Third-person and media examples are fine.
- Wrap line: Biology is one layer of explanation, not the whole story.

## Nervous System Divisions

- **Central**: brain and spinal cord
- **Peripheral**: everything else
- PNS connects sensory and motor systems

::: notes
- Talk track: This is your orientation map. It’s not for memorization, it’s for interpreting signal flow.

## Afferent vs Efferent

- **Afferent**: input toward CNS
- **Efferent**: output from CNS
- Direction tells you what kind of process is happening

::: notes
- Talk track: Example—pain is afferent, movement is efferent.
- Confusion watch: Students often flip them.
:::

---

## Somatic vs Autonomic

- **Somatic**: voluntary, skeletal muscles
- **Autonomic**: automatic, internal organs
- Two subsystems: sympathetic, parasympathetic

::: notes
- Talk track: Autonomic is regulation, not unconscious.
- Watch for moral framing (e.g. “can’t control it” ≠ weakness).
:::

---

## Sympathetic vs Parasympathetic

- Sympathetic: activates body (“fight or flight”)
- Parasympathetic: calms body (“rest and digest”)
- It’s not binary

::: notes
- Clarify: It’s not that one is good and one is bad. It’s about shifting based on context.
:::

## Discussion

When does your body act like it is in danger when it is really performance or stress?  
*If you want a lane: exams, work shifts, sleep, caffeine, social anxiety*  

**Takeaway**: Regulation is flexible shifting, not a binary switch.

::: notes
- Aim: Normalize activation and prevent binary thinking.
- Entry ramp: Action mode is not only danger. It is also performance.
- If quiet: What is a normal situation where your body goes action-mode anyway?
- Guardrail: Keep examples general. No diagnosis talk.
- Wrap line: The goal is context and recovery, not labeling one system good or bad.
