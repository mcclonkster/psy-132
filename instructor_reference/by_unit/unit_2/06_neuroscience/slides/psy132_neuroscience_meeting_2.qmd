## Neurons and Glia

- **Neurons**: transmit signals
- **Glia**: support, repair, insulate
- Glia matter—don’t skip them

::: notes
- Talk track: Glia are not just glue. They shape the environment in which neurons function.
:::

---

## Electrical vs Chemical Signaling

- Electrical: within neuron
- Chemical: between neurons (via synapse)
- Synapse is the communication checkpoint

::: notes
- Talk track: This is the key distinction that keeps medication claims honest.
:::

---

## Synapse and Neurotransmitters

- Neurotransmitters cross the synapse
- Reuptake regulates signal length
- Receptors and context matter

::: notes
- Clarify: Dopamine does not mean pleasure. It depends on pathway and receptor.
:::

## Discussion

What brain-chemical claim do you hear that sounds too simple to be true?  
*If you want a lane: dopamine, serotonin, ADHD meds, “chemical imbalance”*  

**Takeaway**: Neurotransmitter effects depend on receptors, pathways, and context.

::: notes
- Aim: Surface slogans and replace them with pathway thinking.
- Entry ramp: One chemical does not equal one feeling.
- If quiet: What is the most common neurotransmitter claim you have seen online?
- Guardrail: No personal medication disclosure required.
- Wrap line: Replace slogans with pathway and context thinking.

## Brain Methods

- EEG: timing good, location weak
- fMRI: location good, timing weak
- PET: slow, radiation, good for metabolism

::: notes
- Clarify: Activation ≠ cause. All methods have limits.
:::

## Discussion

What brain claim have you seen that felt like it skipped the evidence?  
*If you want a lane: brain scans, “this area causes,” viral infographics, TikTok neuroscience*  

**Takeaway**: Methods constrain conclusions, and correlation is not causation.

::: notes
- Aim: Build claim literacy without cynicism.
- Entry ramp: A brain image feels like proof, but it usually is not proof of cause.
- If quiet: When you see a brain scan, what do you assume it proves?
- Guardrail: Keep it about claims and evidence, not judging people.
- Wrap line: Ask what the method measures before believing what the headline claims.

## Plasticity

- Brains can change with experience
- Practice and repetition drive change
- Change is real—but constrained

::: notes
- Talk track: Plasticity is not infinite. It’s how change happens, not a superpower.

## Exit Prompt

What is one brain claim you’ll now question or reinterpret?
