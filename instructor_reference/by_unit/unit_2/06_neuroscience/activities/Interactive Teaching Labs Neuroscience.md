## Selection rationale
- Neuroscience is most teachable when students manipulate a model, observe a change, and then write a mechanism statement
- The activities below produce recordable outputs suitable for grading at scale
  - screenshots of parameter settings and outcomes
  - labeled structure identifications
  - graph interpretations and causal-chain explanations bounded to the model
- All links are free and student-facing

## Interactive teaching labs

## Lab: Neuron firing and action potentials
- Links
  - https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulations/neuron
  - https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/neuron/latest/neuron_en.html
- Activity type
  - Simulation with manipulable variables
- Output type
  - parameter settings plus an observed outcome change
- Typical completion time
  - 10–20 minutes
- Submission evidence format
  - screenshot
  - short reflection
- Instructor framing notes
  - Require a two-step mechanism statement
    - Manipulation, physiological change, observable output

    - This is a simplified model and omits many biological details

## Lab: Membrane channels and ion flow
- Link
  - https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/membrane-channels
- Activity type
  - Build-and-test membrane simulation

- Instructor framing notes
  - Require an operational definition of the dependent variable
    - Flow rate, direction of flow, or net charge change as shown in the interface

## Optional lab: Whole nervous system 3D model exploration
- Link

  - https://dnalc.cshl.edu/resources/products/3d-brain-app.html
- Activity type
  - App-based interactive structure identification
- Output type
  - structure identification list plus a brief function mapping
- Typical completion time
  - 15–25 minutes
- Submission evidence format
  - screenshot
  - categorical output
- Instructor framing notes
  - Use only if your class can reliably access apps
  - Default alternative
    - BrainFacts 3D Brain

## Teaching designs and ideas

## Option: 50-minute mechanism-first lab day
- Part 1: PhET Neuron with one assigned manipulation
- Part 2: Membrane Channels with a before and after comparison
- Part 3: One short written mechanism chain
  - Variable, physiological change, observed output, one limitation

Grading artifact
- Two screenshots
- One mechanism chain paragraph

## Option: Station rotation for mixed pacing
- Station 1: PhET Neuron
- Station 2: Membrane Channels
- Station 3: BrainFacts 3D Brain scavenger hunt
- Station 4: HHMI neural activity module segment

Grading artifact
- One screenshot per station
- One IV and DV statement per station
- One limitation per station

## Option: Asynchronous online lab that feeds Topic 4 later
- Students run PhET Neuron and record a binary outcome
  - spike occurred or did not occur under a defined setting
- Students submit the setting and outcome
- Instructor aggregates and uses the dataset later for
  - proportions, variability, and design critique

## Debrief prompts that keep this lab-like
- What is the independent variable you manipulated or the condition that differed
- What is the dependent variable and how is it represented in the interface
- What mechanism explains the observed change, based on the model and only the model
- What is one alternative explanation, such as misunderstanding the control or device differences
- What conclusion would be overreach given the simplifications of the model
