notes: Consciousness labs work best when they produce a measurable performance output or structured field data. Grade completion and methods reasoning, not ‘good sleep’ or personal disclosure. Click-test links before release.

## Selection rationale
- Consciousness is easiest to teach through measurable attention/vigilance tasks plus structured sleep and circadian measures
- These activities produce recordable outputs suitable for grading at scale
  - reaction time, lapses, and errors over time
  - chronotype and sleep-quality scores
  - sleep diary field data across days
- All links are free and student-facing

## Teaching designs and ideas

## Option: 50-minute lab day, “attention over time”
- Part 1: PVT-B
- Part 2: SART
- Part 3: One short debrief comparing tasks
  - what each task measures and what each task confounds
- Wrap: one paragraph
  - IV, DV, and one validity threat for each task

Grading artifact
- Two screenshots
- Two numeric outputs
- One comparison paragraph

## Option: Station rotation for mixed pacing
- Station 1: PVT-B
- Station 2: SART
- Station 3: Chronotype (CIRENS)
- Station 4: Jet Lag Rooster (fictional scenario)
- Station 5: Sleep quality scale (vignette mode)

Grading artifact
- One screenshot per station
- One IV and DV statement per station
- One limitation per station

## Option: Asynchronous lab that generates a class dataset for Topic 4 later
- Students complete:
  - CIRENS score
  - one vigilance task metric (PVT-B mean RT or lapse count)
  - one week of diary-derived sleep duration estimate
- Instructor aggregates and uses later to discuss:
  - correlations, variability, and why causal inference is not justified

## Debrief prompts that keep this lab-like
- What is the independent variable or condition difference you are treating as meaningful
- What is the dependent variable and how is it operationalized
- What is one confound that is especially likely in online sleep and attention labs
- What claim is justified and what claim would be overreach
- What additional data would you need to make a stronger inference
