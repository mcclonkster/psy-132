## Topic definition and focus

Perception is the process by which the brain **selects, organizes, interprets, and consciously experiences** sensory information.

In these materials, perception is explicitly framed as “psychological” in the sense that it is shaped by **attention, expectations, experience, and context**, even though it is built from sensory input.

## Boundary with Topic 7: Sensation

- Topic 7 (Sensation): detection and transduction; receptors register stimulus energy
- Topic 8 (Perception): organization and interpretation; the brain constructs experience from input plus context

A useful teaching intuition is that sensation is “what gets detected,” while perception is “what it means and what you experience.”

## What Topic 8 includes

### Bottom-up and top-down processing as the core explanatory pair

Perception is explained as a combination of two processing directions:

- Bottom-up processing: perceptions are built from sensory input
- Top-down processing: interpretation is influenced by prior knowledge, experience, and context

Context-shift examples (same stimulus, different meaning) are used to show that perception is not a direct recording of input.

### Attention as a gating mechanism

Attention is treated as a determining mechanism, not a side topic:

- selective attention: focusing conscious resources on some inputs while ignoring others
- inattentional blindness: failing to notice unexpected stimuli when attention is engaged elsewhere
- change blindness: failing to detect changes when attention is disrupted

Classic demonstrations (for example, the “gorilla” selective attention task) are used to show how people can miss obvious information while performing a focused task.

### Gestalt principles as organization rules

Gestalt psychology is used to explain how perception organizes inputs into meaningful wholes. The materials emphasize predictable grouping and segmentation principles, including:

- figure-ground
- proximity
- similarity
- continuity (good continuation)
- closure

Perceptual hypotheses and perceptual set are introduced as “educated guesses” shaped by expectations and experience, which explains why perception can diverge from physical input.

### Depth perception as cue-based inference

Depth perception is framed as inference about spatial relationships in 3-D space, built from cues such as:

- binocular cues (for example, binocular disparity; convergence)
- monocular cues (for example, interposition; relative size; linear perspective; texture gradient; relative height; light and shadow; motion parallax)

### Perceptual constancy as stability across changing input

Perceptual constancy describes how perception remains stable despite changes in sensory input:

- size constancy
- shape constancy
- color constancy

Illusions are treated as demonstrations that perception follows rules and inferences, not a perfect recording.

## Operational definition for PSY-132 materials

Students should be able to:

- define perception as the **organization, interpretation, and conscious experience** of sensory information
- explain and apply **bottom-up vs top-down** processing using a context-shift example (same stimulus, different meaning)
- explain how **attention** shapes perception and correctly describe inattentional blindness and change blindness
- use **Gestalt principles** to predict how a viewer will group or segment an image (figure-ground, proximity, similarity, continuity, closure)
- describe depth perception as cue-based inference, distinguishing **binocular** and **monocular** cues with at least one example of each
- define perceptual constancy and distinguish size, shape, and color constancy

## One-sentence student-facing definition

Perception is how the brain organizes and interprets sensory input into a conscious experience of the world, influenced by attention, context, and expectations.

## Arc function

Perception defines the **interpretation layer**: how the brain organizes sensation into experienced reality.

### Conceptual movement

- from “seeing is believing” to perception as **constructed inference**
- from bottom-up input to bottom-up plus **top-down** processing (context, expectations, attention)

### Learning emphasis

- organization rules (Gestalt principles) and inference rules (depth cues, constancies)
- attention as a gating mechanism that constrains what enters awareness

### Student-facing payoff

This answers: “Why do people disagree about what they saw?” and supplies a non-moral explanation: the system is built to infer, not to record.

## Backward and forward links

Backward links

- Topic 7: sensory input and transduction
- Topic 6: brain systems that support perceptual organization

Forward links

- Topic 9: awareness is constrained by perceptual and attentional limits
- Topic 11: reconstructive remembering parallels constructive perceiving
- Topic 12: schemas and heuristics extend “top-down processing” into reasoning
- Topic 19: attribution and social interpretation parallel perceptual interpretation
- Topic 23: symptom perception and interpretation issues recur in clinical contexts

## Unit 2 approved bullets (recommended final wording)

- Explain how nervous system signaling and brain systems support behavior and mental processes, using a systems-level (not single-center) view
- Distinguish sensation from perception and explain how perception constructs experience from input plus context
- Describe consciousness as state-dependent and limited, and interpret basic correlates (sleep stages, attention limits, EEG-style patterns)

## Maintenance checklist

- Add an explicit, operational definition of core mastery that states the inclusion test in observable performance terms
- Normalize term types so the lists contain assessable vocabulary rather than category-only placeholders
- Keep this topic note conceptual and performance-based; treat the expanded term bank as an appendix rather than the main body
- When teaching perception, prioritize a small set of reusable demonstrations (context-shift, attention limits, Gestalt grouping, depth cues, constancies) over long lists of named illusions
