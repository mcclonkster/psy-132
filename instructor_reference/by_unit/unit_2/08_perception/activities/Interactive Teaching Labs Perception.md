notes: Perception labs should be graded on predictions and evidence from interactive outputs. Avoid treating illusions as 'your brain is broken' narratives; frame them as evidence about normal perceptual inference. Click-test links before release.

## Selection rationale
- Perception is ideal for interactive labs because perceptual outputs are immediate and strongly debriefable
- Each activity produces recordable outputs suitable for grading at scale
  - screenshot of the illusion state or task outcome
  - a short prediction and whether it was supported
  - a brief mechanistic explanation using perception concepts
- All links are free and student-facing

## Interactive teaching labs

## Lab: Perceptual organization and object perception (Gestalt, figure-ground, illusory contours, bistable perception)
- Links
  - ISLE Chapter 5 hub
    - https://isle.hanover.edu/Chapter05.html
  - ISLE 2.0 Chapter 5 hub
    - https://isle.hanover.edu/isle2/index.html?ch=Chapter05
- Activity type
  - Interactive perception demonstrations and mini-experiments
- Output type
  - labeled perceptual phenomenon plus a short explanation
- Typical completion time
  - 15–30 minutes
- Submission evidence format
  - screenshot
  - short reflection
  - categorical output
- Instructor framing notes
  - Assign 3 specific activities so students produce comparable outputs
  - Require students to label the principle
    - figure-ground, proximity, similarity, closure, good continuation, common fate, illusory contours, bistable perception

## Lab: Depth perception and size constancy (cues and classic illusions)
- Link
  - ISLE Chapter 7 hub
    - https://isle.hanover.edu/Chapter07.html
- Activity type
  - Interactive depth and size activities
- Output type
  - cue manipulation plus observed perceptual change
- Typical completion time
  - 15–30 minutes
- Submission evidence format
  - screenshot
  - short reflection
- Instructor framing notes
  - Require a monocular cue inventory for one activity
  - Require one statement distinguishing cue from inference

## Lab: Motion perception and aftereffects (adaptation as evidence)
- Link
  - ISLE Chapter 8 hub
    - https://isle.hanover.edu/Chapter08.html
- Activity type
  - Interactive motion perception tasks
- Output type
  - demonstration outcome plus an adaptation explanation
- Typical completion time
  - 10–25 minutes
- Submission evidence format
  - screenshot
  - short reflection
- Instructor framing notes
  - Require students to write a prediction before adaptation and a report after adaptation
  - Require a mechanism statement referencing adaptation and opponent processing concepts where appropriate

## Lab: Speech perception as multisensory perception (integration and top-down effects)
- Link
  - ISLE Chapter 12 hub
    - https://isle.hanover.edu/Chapter12.html
- Activity type
  - Interactive speech perception activities
- Output type
  - perceptual judgment and a brief explanation
- Typical completion time
  - 10–25 minutes
- Submission evidence format
  - screenshot
  - short reflection
- Instructor framing notes
  - Assign one of:
    - McGurk effect, phonemic restoration, voicing onset time
  - Require a statement about multisensory integration or top-down reconstruction

## Lab: Attention–perception boundary (change blindness flicker task)
- Link
  - https://sites.socsci.uci.edu/~ddhoff/cb.html
- Activity type
  - Interactive change blindness demonstration
- Output type
  - whether the change was detected and what improved detection
- Typical completion time
  - 5–15 minutes
- Submission evidence format
  - screenshot
  - short reflection
- Instructor framing notes
  - Require a procedural note
    - where they looked and what strategy helped
  - Require a limitation note
    - this is a demo and not a calibrated measure of attention

## Supplemental lab library: Visual phenomena and illusions (station options)
- Links
  - Index
    - https://michaelbach.de/ot/
  - Motion aftereffect
    - https://michaelbach.de/ot/mot-adapt/
  - Motion-induced blindness
    - https://michaelbach.de/ot/mot-mib/
- Activity type
  - Interactive illusion demonstrations with controlled viewing
- Output type
  - illusion state plus explanation of why perception diverges from stimulus
- Typical completion time
  - 5–15 minutes per station
- Submission evidence format
  - screenshot
  - short reflection
- Instructor framing notes
  - Assign specific illusions rather than letting students roam
  - Require one boundary condition
    - viewing distance, fixation, screen brightness, refresh rate can change effects

## Teaching designs and ideas

## Option: 50-minute lab day, “perception as inference”
- Part 1: One ISLE Chapter 5 activity on Gestalt organization
- Part 2: One ISLE Chapter 7 depth cue activity
- Part 3: Change blindness demo
- Wrap: One synthesis paragraph
  - “What does this tell us about perception being constructive rather than a camera”

Grading artifact
- Three screenshots
- One synthesis paragraph with two perception terms used correctly

## Option: Station rotation for mixed pacing
- Station 1: ISLE Chapter 5 (organization)
- Station 2: ISLE Chapter 7 (depth)
- Station 3: ISLE Chapter 8 (motion)
- Station 4: ISLE Chapter 12 (speech perception)
- Station 5: Change blindness

Grading artifact
- One screenshot per station
- One IV and DV statement per station
- One mechanism statement per station

## Option: Asynchronous online lab with standardized prompts
- Students complete:
  - one ISLE organization activity
  - one depth activity
  - one change blindness demo
- Students submit:
  - screenshots
  - three short answers
    - prediction
    - observation
    - mechanism explanation

## Debrief prompts that keep this lab-like
- What did you manipulate or what differed across conditions
- What did you perceive and how did it differ from the physical stimulus
- What inference is the perceptual system making in this situation
- What boundary condition changes the effect, such as fixation, distance, or context cues
- What conclusion is justified and what conclusion would be overreach
