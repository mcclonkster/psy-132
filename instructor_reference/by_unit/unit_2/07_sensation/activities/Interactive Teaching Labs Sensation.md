## Selection rationale
- Sensation is naturally lab-driven because the core questions are measurement questions
- These activities produce recordable outputs suitable for grading at scale
  - thresholds and JND estimates
  - signal detection choices and ROC shifts
  - stimulus parameter manipulations with visible and audible effects
- All links are free and student-facing

## Interactive teaching labs

## Lab: Psychophysics methods hub (thresholds, JND, adjustment, and SDT)
- Links
  - https://isle.hanover.edu/Chapter02.html
  - https://isle.hanover.edu/isle2/index.html?ch=Chapter02
- Activity type
  - Interactive psychophysics labs
- Output type
  - threshold estimate or JND estimate
  - SDT decision outcomes and ROC movement
- Typical completion time
  - 20–40 minutes for a multi-part lab day
  - 10–20 minutes for a single activity
- Submission evidence format
  - screenshot
  - numeric output
  - short reflection
- Instructor framing notes
  - Assign a specific method and stimulus so students produce comparable outputs
  - Require an operational definition for the DV
    - threshold as a criterion on responses
    - JND as a difference threshold estimate
  - Require one validity limitation
    - device differences, screen size, headphone quality, background noise, practice effects

Suggested ISLE mini-lab menu for Topic 7
- Method of limits for absolute threshold and difference threshold
- Method of constant stimuli for absolute threshold and difference threshold
- Method of adjustment for threshold estimation
- Signal detection decision shifts and ROC curve movement

## Lab: Signal detection theory lab (decision criteria and ROC)
- Link
  - Use the SDT and ROC activities from the ISLE Chapter 2 hub above
- Activity type
  - SDT decision-making simulation
- Output type
  - hits, misses, false alarms, correct rejections
  - criterion shifts and ROC shifts
- Typical completion time
  - 10–20 minutes
- Submission evidence format
  - screenshot
  - numeric output
  - short reflection
- Instructor framing notes
  - Require a confusion-matrix statement
  - Require a criterion statement in plain language
    - how strict the student set their decision rule

## Lab: Visual sensation lab (color mixing and wavelength)
- Links
  - https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulations/color-vision
  - https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/color-vision/latest/color-vision_en.html
- Activity type
  - Simulation with manipulable stimulus parameters
- Output type
  - parameter settings and perceived color outcomes
- Typical completion time
  - 10–20 minutes
- Submission evidence format
  - two screenshots
  - short reflection
- Instructor framing notes
  - Require a stimulus-control description
    - which sliders or wavelength settings were changed
  - Require a mechanistic claim at the level of cones and light mixture
  - Require one boundary condition
    - the sim models typical vision and does not represent all forms of color vision variation

## Lab: Auditory sensation lab (sound waves and intensity)
- Links
  - https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulations/sound-waves
  - https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/sound-waves/latest/sound-waves_all.html
- Activity type
  - Simulation with manipulable stimulus parameters
- Output type
  - frequency and amplitude changes with visible wave changes and audible changes
- Typical completion time
  - 10–20 minutes
- Submission evidence format
  - screenshot
  - short reflection
- Instructor framing notes
  - Require a mapping statement
    - which control corresponds to pitch, which corresponds to loudness
  - Require one caution about device variability
    - speaker differences and volume settings limit comparability

## Lab: Hearing sensitivity curve lab (frequency response)
- Link
  - https://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/hearing.html
- Activity type
  - Interactive hearing sensitivity test
- Output type
  - sensitivity curve or equal-loudness style output
- Typical completion time
  - 10–25 minutes
- Submission evidence format
  - screenshot
  - short reflection
- Instructor framing notes
  - Treat as a demonstration of frequency-dependent sensitivity, not a diagnostic audiogram
  - Require students to report their hardware conditions
    - headphones versus speakers and approximate volume setting
  - Require one validity limitation
    - lack of calibration and uncontrolled environment

## Teaching designs and ideas

## Option: 50-minute psychophysics lab day
- Part 1: One ISLE threshold method activity
- Part 2: One ISLE SDT activity
- Part 3: One PhET lab (Color Vision or Sound Waves) to connect stimulus parameters to sensory experience
- Wrap: one-page methods summary
  - IV, DV, operational definition, one confound, one fix

Grading artifact
- Two screenshots minimum
- One numeric estimate
- One short methods paragraph

## Option: Station rotation for mixed pacing
- Station 1: ISLE threshold method
- Station 2: ISLE SDT decision task
- Station 3: PhET Color Vision
- Station 4: PhET Sound Waves
- Station 5: UNSW hearing curve demo

Grading artifact
- One screenshot per station
- One sentence per station identifying IV and DV
- One limitation per station

## Option: Asynchronous lab with standardized prompts
- Students complete one ISLE activity and one PhET activity
- Students submit:
  - screenshots
  - one numeric output
  - three short answers
    - IV and DV
    - operational definition for the DV
    - one threat to validity and one mitigation

## Debrief prompts that keep this lab-like
- What was manipulated or what differed across trials
- What was measured and how was it operationalized
- How would a stricter or looser criterion change outcomes in SDT
- What sources of error are most likely in an online sensation lab
- What conclusion is justified and what conclusion would be overreach
