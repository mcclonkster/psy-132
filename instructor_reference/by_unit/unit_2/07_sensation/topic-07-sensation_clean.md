## Topic definition and focus

Sensation is the bottom-up physiological process by which specialized sensory receptors detect physical energy or chemical molecules in the environment (or in the body) and convert that input into neural signals that can be carried into the nervous system.

In these materials, sensation is treated as input: the registration and transduction of stimuli prior to interpretation.

- perception (Topic 8): the brain's selection, organization, and interpretation of sensations

## What Topic 7 includes

### Transduction as the signature mechanism

Transduction is the conversion of stimulus energy into neural signals (action potentials). This is the bridge concept between Topic 6 (neurons and action potentials) and Topic 7 (sensory systems).

### Sensory receptors as stimulus-specific detectors

Sensation begins with specialized receptors tuned to particular forms of input. The documents repeatedly frame receptors as specialized neurons that respond to specific stimulus types.

### The classic "five senses" framing is incomplete

These materials explicitly treat the classic five-senses list as an oversimplification and include additional sensory systems:

- vestibular sense (balance)
- body position and movement (proprioception or kinesthesia)
- pain (nociception)
- temperature (thermoception)

### Psychophysics: how sensitive is a sense?

Sensory sensitivity is framed using classic psychophysics terms:

- absolute threshold: minimum stimulus energy detected 50 percent of the time
- difference threshold (just noticeable difference): minimum difference needed to detect a change; tied to Weber's law (proportional change detection)
- signal detection theory: detecting weak signals depends on context and internal state (alertness, expectations, motivation), not only stimulus intensity
- sensory adaptation: reduced sensitivity to constant stimulation over time

### Sensory systems as modality-specific input pipelines

Across modalities, sensation follows a common logic:

- stimulus property
- receptor mechanism
- neural pathway

Examples emphasized across these materials include:

- vision: light waves; wavelength or frequency (color); amplitude (brightness); rods and cones; optic nerve and early visual pathways
- hearing: sound waves; frequency (pitch); amplitude (loudness); ear anatomy and hair-cell transduction
- taste and smell (chemical senses): receptors interacting with molecules; strong interaction between taste and smell
- touch, temperature, pain: multiple receptor types (mechanoreceptors, thermoreceptors, nociceptors) and pathways to somatosensory cortex
- vestibular and proprioception or kinesthesia: balance and body position systems treated as part of the sensory suite

## Boundary with Topic 8: Perception

The boundary is reinforced as:

- Topic 7 (Sensation): detection, transduction, and relay of stimulus information
- Topic 8 (Perception): organization and interpretation of input into conscious experience, shaped by top-down influences (attention, expectations, context, culture, motivation)

Crash Course #5 uses clinical examples (including prosopagnosia) to show that intact sensation can coexist with impaired perception, which is a clean way to teach the boundary.

## Operational definition for PSY-132 materials

Students should be able to:

- define sensation as receptor-based detection of stimuli and distinguish it from perception
- explain transduction as stimulus-energy-to-neural-signal conversion
- use these psychophysics terms accurately: absolute threshold, difference threshold (just noticeable difference), Weber's law, signal detection theory, sensory adaptation
- give at least one correct pipeline example for a sensory modality (for example: light to rods or cones to optic nerve; sound to cochlear hair cells to auditory nerve)

## One-sentence student-facing definition

Sensation is how sensory receptors detect physical or chemical stimuli and convert them into neural signals that the brain can use.

## Arc function

Sensation defines the input layer: what the body detects and transduces into neural signals.

### Conceptual movement

- from "I see, hear, feel" to stimulus to receptor to transduction to signal
- from "five senses" to multiple sensory systems with measurable sensitivity

### Learning emphasis

- psychophysics as measurement: thresholds, just noticeable differences, signal detection, adaptation
- detection as probabilistic and context-sensitive (signal detection), not a simple on-off event

### Student-facing payoff

This answers: "What does it mean to sense something?" and makes evidence concrete through thresholds and detection errors.

## Backward and forward links

Backward links

- Topic 6: neural signaling is prerequisite for transduction and sensory pathways
- Topics 3-4: psychophysics relies on measurement and inference

Forward links

- Topic 8: perception builds on sensation and adds top-down organization
- Topic 9: awareness constraints affect what is consciously registered
- Topic 11: encoding quality depends on attention and sensory conditions
- Topic 12: perceptual set and context effects generalize into cognitive schemas
- Topic 19: eyewitness and social conflict examples depend on the idea that input is not experience

## Unit 2 approved bullets (recommended final wording)

- Explain how nervous system signaling and brain systems support behavior and mental processes, using a systems-level (not single-center) view
- Distinguish sensation from perception and explain how perception constructs experience from input plus context
- Describe consciousness as state-dependent and limited, and interpret basic correlates (sleep stages, attention limits, EEG-style patterns)

## Maintenance checklist

- Add an explicit, operational definition of core mastery that states the inclusion test in observable performance terms
- Normalize term types so the lists contain assessable vocabulary rather than category-only placeholders
- Keep this topic note conceptual and performance-based; treat the expanded term bank as an appendix rather than the main body
- When you need modality detail, add it as a short pipeline example rather than a full anatomy inventory
