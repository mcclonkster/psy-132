# PSY-132 Interactive Teaching Labs (Free Only): Intelligence

## Selection rationale
- These labs are free to run for students in a browser, except where explicitly labeled as an optional app-based lab
- These labs produce concrete outputs you can treat as data, such as reaction time, accuracy, span length, or number correct
- These labs support intro-psych debriefs about what intelligence tests actually measure, how measurement error shows up, and why “one score” is always a simplification

## Instructor framing that keeps this academically clean
- Treat results as demonstrations of measurement and individual differences, not as diagnosis or placement
- Use at least two different task types so students see that “intelligence” is not one skill

## Core lab hubs (bookmark and reuse)
- PsyToolkit Experiment Library (browser-run experiments with no plugins): https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/
- Hanover Cognition Laboratory Experiments, HTML5/JS hub (adjustable parameters): https://psych.hanover.edu/javatest/cle/Cognition_js/cognition.html

## Lab station set (recommended): Build intelligence from components

### Station A: Processing speed and visual scanning
- PsyToolkit Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) overview: https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/digit_substitution.html
- PsyToolkit DSST run page: https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/experiment_digit_substitution.html

### Station B: Working memory capacity
- PsyToolkit Digit Span overview: https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/digitspan.html
- PsyToolkit Digit Span run page: https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/experiment_digitspan.html

- PsyToolkit Automated Operation Span (O-Span) overview: https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/aospan.html
- PsyToolkit O-Span run page: https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/experiment_aospan.html

### Station C: Spatial reasoning
- PsyToolkit Mental Rotation overview: https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/mentalrotation.html
- PsyToolkit Mental Rotation run page: https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/experiment_mentalrotation.html

- Hanover Mental Rotation Experiment (HTML5/JS with adjustable settings): https://psych.hanover.edu/javatest/cle/Cognition_js/exp/mentRot.html

### Station D: Rule discovery and cognitive flexibility
- PsyToolkit WCST-inspired task overview: https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/wcst.html
- PsyToolkit WCST-inspired run page: https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/experiment_wcst.html

### Station E: Verbal ability, with explicit fairness caveats
- OpenPsychometrics Vocabulary IQ Test (VIQT) start page: https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/VIQT/

## Optional composite lab (use only if you want to discuss what a single “IQ-like” number does and does not mean)
- OpenPsychometrics Full Scale IQ Test (FSIQ) start page: https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/FSIQ/
- OpenPsychometrics FSIQ results page (shows how they adjust results for the online sample): https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/FSIQ/results.php

## Optional app-based lab (still free, but not browser-based)
- UC Matrix Reasoning Task (UCMRT) overview article with app-download instructions: https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2018/10/29/uc-psychologists-devise-free-test-measuring-intelligence
