- Ask students to submit a single number and a screenshot of their results page in the LMS

### Fast debrief questions that force a lab mindset
- What is the independent variable, and what values did it take
- What is the dependent variable, and how was it measured
- What alternative explanations exist, such as practice effects, device differences, distractions, or misunderstanding instructions
- What pattern would you predict if we changed difficulty, time pressure, or the proportion of trials

### Two ready-to-run 50-minute class formats
- Station rotation format: Use Stroop, Flanker, Task Switching, and Monty Hall as four stations, then do a whole-class synthesis comparing “where cognition breaks”
- Bottleneck format: Use Attentional Blink plus Dual Task, then treat both as evidence that attention is limited and not a single pool

### Easy ways to connect Cognition back to Statistics without adding work
- Compare two conditions as a difference score, such as congruent minus incongruent reaction time in Stroop
- Graph the class distribution and discuss skew, outliers, and measurement noise
- Use the same dataset later as practice for confidence intervals or randomization tests
```

scope: "teaching_interactive_labs_only_free"
topics:
  - topic_number: 13
    topic_name: "Intelligence"
created: 2025-12-31
---

## Selection rationale
- These labs are free to run for students in a browser, except where explicitly labeled as an optional app-based lab
- These labs produce concrete outputs you can treat as data, such as reaction time, accuracy, span length, or number correct
- These labs support intro-psych debriefs about what intelligence tests actually measure, how measurement error shows up, and why “one score” is always a simplification

## Instructor framing that keeps this academically clean
- Treat results as demonstrations of measurement and individual differences, not as diagnosis or placement
- Use anonymous or coded IDs for submissions, especially if you plan to aggregate class results
- Use at least two different task types so students see that “intelligence” is not one skill

- UC Matrix Reasoning Task (UCMRT) overview article with app-download instructions: https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2018/10/29/uc-psychologists-devise-free-test-measuring-intelligence

## Teaching ideas that keep the activity “lab-like”

### Minimal-prep 50-minute class plan
- Run DSST and Mental Rotation as a whole-class warm-up so students understand the output
- Assign O-Span or Digit Span as the individual lab component
- End with a synthesis prompt where students map each task to a hypothesized ability component, such as speed, working memory, or spatial reasoning

### Data collection that stays lightweight
- Require only one metric per station, such as number correct, max span, or mean reaction time
- Use a single Google Form or Brightspace quiz item per station with one numeric field and one reflection field

### Debrief questions that force scientific thinking
- What is the dependent variable, and what did the task treat as “better performance”
- What nuisance variables could distort results, including device type, screen size, distractions, or misunderstanding instructions
- What would you change to improve validity if this were a real assessment study

### A high-yield concept demo that students remember
- Show “positive manifold” by asking whether students who score high on DSST also tend to score higher on span or rotation
- Use that pattern to motivate the idea of a general factor without claiming that any single student’s score is their “true intelligence”

## Teaching ideas and lab designs

### A minimal-prep 50-minute class that feels like a real lab
- Run Lexical Decision first and collect two numbers from each student, such as mean RT for words and mean RT for nonwords
- Run one self-paced reading task using two sentence sets, such as simple syntax versus garden-path style, and collect a single reading-time metric
- Run one ISLE speech perception activity, such as Voicing Onset Time or Phonemic Restoration, and collect a structured judgment, such as where perception flips or how comprehension changes

### Easy variables that students can actually reason about
- You can treat word status as an independent variable in LDT, such as word versus nonword
- You can treat sentence type as an independent variable in self-paced reading, such as straightforward versus syntactically tricky sentences
- You can treat signal quality as an independent variable in Phonemic Restoration by adjusting how much audio is blocked

### Debrief prompts that force “theoretical perspectives” thinking
- Ask what top-down knowledge the brain is using and how you can tell
- Ask what part of the task is language-specific versus general attention and decision making
- Ask what would change if the same task were run in a second language or with unfamiliar vocabulary

### Low-friction data workflow that scales
- Have students submit one difference score per task, such as RT nonword minus RT word, and one sentence condition minus the other
- Plot class distributions later in the Statistics unit to show skew, outliers, and measurement noise
- Re-run one task at the end of the term as a replication exercise and compare distributions

topics:
  - topic_number: 16
    topic_name: "Health"
created: 2025-12-31
---

## Selection rationale
- These activities are free for students to run
- These activities behave like labs because students make choices, manipulate variables, and produce outputs such as graphs, scores, or decisions
- These activities support intro-psych debriefs about health behavior, stress physiology, and how environments shape risk

## Instructor framing that keeps this academically clean
- Treat outputs as demonstrations, not as medical advice or diagnosis
- Use fictional or provided scenarios when an activity could drift into personal disclosure
- Collect only minimal data for grading, such as a screenshot of a graph and one numeric result

## Lab set A: Disease spread and public health decision-making (highly lab-like)

- Learn.Genetics Utah: Meth Mouse: https://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/addiction/methmouse/

## Teaching ideas that keep this unit feeling like an actual lab

### A clean 50-minute class plan that produces class data
- Start with Modeling Disease Spread and require one screenshot of an SIR graph plus one parameter set
- Run Solve the Outbreak for 10–15 minutes and require one decision point plus the reasoning for that decision
- End with a two-question synthesis that links behavior, incentives, and risk perception to outcomes

### A station rotation that feels like “health psych meets public health”
- Station 1: Modeling Disease Spread with one parameter change and one graph interpretation
- Station 2: Measles vaccination modeling with one predicted threshold for “control”
- Station 3: Solve the Outbreak with one key data clue and one decision justification
- Station 4: Stress Body-Mind inventory with one class graph variable and one interpretation sentence
- Station 5: Mouse Party with one drug mechanism and one predicted behavioral effect

### Low-friction grading inputs that scale
- Require one numeric output per station, such as peak infected, time-to-peak, vaccination rate, score, or number of symptoms endorsed
- Require one short explanation per station that labels an independent variable and a dependent variable

### Debrief prompts that force scientific thinking
- What variable did you manipulate, and what outcome changed
- What assumptions are built into the model or game mechanics
- What confounds exist, including device differences, prior knowledge, or time pressure
- What would you measure differently if you were designing a real study on health behavior

notes: "All links below are selected for lab-style interactivity (choices, reaction times, scores, or interpretable outputs). Use neutral framing and avoid personal disclosure."
---

## Selection rationale
- These activities are free to run and do not require paid courseware licenses. PsyToolkit explicitly states it is “totally free.” citeturn12search11
- These activities function like online labs because students generate interpretable outputs (choices, reaction times, errors, or scored scales). PsyToolkit also notes students can run demos in-browser and copy response-time/error data. citeturn3search4turn1search0
- They align cleanly to Intro Psych motivation themes: incentives and reward pursuit, risk–reward tradeoffs, approach–avoidance, self-regulation, and needs.

## Core interactive lab tasks (behavioral tasks with observable performance)

### Incentives and reward learning (choice patterns over time)
- PsyToolkit: Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) overview: https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/igt.html citeturn0search0
- PsyToolkit: IGT run page: https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/experiment_igt.html citeturn0search4

Teaching angle
- Treat as “reward chasing vs long-term payoff.” Debrief why people persist with high-reward/high-loss decks and how feedback shapes behavior.

Suggested student data capture
- Count choices from each deck in the last half of the task, or record the final score shown on-screen (if displayed).

### Risk-taking for reward (stop vs keep going under uncertainty)
- PsyToolkit: Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) overview: https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/bart.html citeturn3search2
- PsyToolkit: BART run page: https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/experiment_bart.html citeturn3search5

Teaching angle
- Clean demonstration of incentive motivation: each pump increases reward but raises risk.

Suggested student data capture
- Average pumps on non-explosion trials (if shown), number of explosions, or final points.

### Intertemporal choice (delay discounting: “now vs later”)
- Pavlovia demo: delay_discount run page: https://run.pavlovia.org/demos/delay_discount/ citeturn10search1
- Description page (task summary): https://gitlab.pavlovia.org/demos/delay_discount citeturn11search0

Teaching angle
- Make “delay discounting” concrete with repeated choices between smaller-sooner and larger-later rewards.

Suggested student data capture
- Proportion of “immediate” choices across the task, or the smallest immediate amount a student accepts instead of a delayed option (if the task displays it).

### Approach–avoidance tendencies (motivational orientation measured as reaction time)
- PsyToolkit: VAAST with words overview: https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/vaast_words.html citeturn13search1
- PsyToolkit: VAAST with words run page: https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/experiment_vaast_words.html citeturn13search0
- PsyToolkit: VAAST with images overview: https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/vaast_images.html citeturn12search2
- PsyToolkit: VAAST with images run page: https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/experiment_vaast_images.html citeturn12search1

Teaching angle
- Links motivation to action tendencies: approach positive stimuli faster than negative, and avoid negative faster than positive (compatibility effect).

Suggested student data capture
- Compatibility effect as a single number: mean RT incompatible minus mean RT compatible (if the task displays summary stats; otherwise screenshot final feedback).

## Motivation-adjacent measurement labs (scored scales with strong classroom debrief value)

### Needs and need satisfaction (theory-to-measurement bridge)
- PsyToolkit: Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs questionnaire (includes “Run the demo”): https://www.psytoolkit.org/survey-library/maslow.html citeturn3search3

Teaching angle
- Students see how “big theory” becomes measurable subscales and why measurement choices matter.

Suggested student data capture
- One subscale score plus one interpretation sentence: “Which need domain looks least satisfied and why might that be context-dependent?”

### Persistence toward long-term goals (self-regulatory motivation)
- PsyToolkit: Short Grit Scale (Grit-S): https://www.psytoolkit.org/survey-library/grit-short.html citeturn2search0

Teaching angle
- Use as a measurement lab: discuss traits vs states, reliability, and what grit does and does not predict.

Suggested student data capture
- Total grit score and one “measurement limitation” note.

### Procrastination as motivational conflict (avoidance, self-handicapping, task aversion)
- PsyToolkit: General Procrastination Scale (GP): https://www.psytoolkit.org/survey-library/procrastination-gp.html citeturn2search16

Teaching angle
- Map procrastination onto immediate reinforcement, aversive tasks, and emotion regulation without turning it into a confessional assignment.

Suggested student data capture
- Score plus one plausible confound (sleep, stress, workload week).

### Impulsiveness (reward sensitivity and control problems as measurable tendencies)
- PsyToolkit: Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS): https://www.psytoolkit.org/survey-library/impulsiveness-barratt.html citeturn2search3

Teaching angle
- Connect impulsiveness to delay discounting and risk tasks: prediction before data.

Suggested student data capture
- BIS score and a hypothesis: “Higher BIS predicts more immediate choices / more pumps.”

### Risk propensity (short, fast, good predictor variable for BART/IGT)
- PsyToolkit: Risk Propensity Scale (RPS): https://www.psytoolkit.org/survey-library/risk-rps.html citeturn3search20

Teaching angle
- Use as the “predictor variable” in a simple correlational class dataset.

Suggested student data capture
- RPS score + BART metric, later graphed in Topic 4.

## Teaching designs that feel like real online labs

### Option A: 50-minute station rotation (high engagement, low tech risk)
- Station 1: BART (risk–reward)
- Station 2: Delay discounting (now vs later)
- Station 3: VAAST (approach–avoidance)
- Station 4: One scale (RPS or BIS) to use as a predictor variable
- Whole-class debrief: “What did we operationalize as motivation in each station?”

Grading-friendly submission
- One numeric output per station plus one screenshot (or one copied score line) to reduce disputes about data entry.

### Option B: Hypothesis-first mini-study (teaches scientific reasoning inside the content)
- Pre-register in class (informally): “Higher impulsiveness predicts more immediate choices and more risk-taking.”
- Collect: BIS score + delay discounting proportion-immediate + BART risk metric.
- Debrief: Does the pattern support the hypothesis? What would you change in a real study?

### Debrief prompts that force lab thinking
- What is the independent variable in this activity (or what differs across trials)?
- What is the dependent variable and how is it quantified (RT, choices, points, score)?
- What threatens validity here (device differences, distractions, misunderstanding instructions, time pressure)?
- What alternative explanation competes with the motivation explanation (learning, fatigue, comprehension, speed–accuracy tradeoff)?

## Practical cautions (keeps this topic academically safe)
- Avoid requiring students to disclose personal financial stress, substance use, or mental health details.
- Use neutral phrasing: “This task demonstrates choice under incentives,” not “This reveals what you are like.”
- Encourage anonymous IDs if you plan to show class distributions.

- PsyToolkit Dot-Probe overview: https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/dotprobe.html
- PsyToolkit Dot-Probe run page: https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/experiment_dotprobe.html

Teaching use
- Clean demonstration that emotionally salient stimuli can capture attention.
- Debrief the operational definition: “bias” as faster responses when the probe follows a threat-related word.

Student data capture (choose one)
- Mean reaction time by condition (if shown).
- A screenshot of the results screen plus one sentence: “Which condition was faster?”

## Lab set B: Emotion recognition and labeling (performance output; debriefable)

- Paul Ekman Group: Facial Expression Quiz (“What’s that facial expression?”): https://www.paulekman.com/quizzes/whats-that-facial-expression-test-quiz/

### “Reading the Mind in the Eyes” (RMET) interactive
- RMET interactive (launch): https://s3.amazonaws.com/he-assets-prod/interactives/233_reading_the_mind_through_eyes/Launch.html

Teaching use
- Use as a measurement lab: accuracy as the dependent variable.
- Debrief construct boundaries: “emotion recognition” versus “theory of mind” versus vocabulary demands.

Student data capture (choose one)
- Total correct.
- Accuracy by emotion category (if you assign a short coding sheet).

## Lab set C: Affect and emotion regulation as measurement labs (scored scales with feedback)

### Momentary affect (positive vs negative affect; fast; scored feedback)
- PsyToolkit PANAS (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule): https://www.psytoolkit.org/survey-library/panas.html
- PsyToolkit SPANE (positive/negative feelings; affect balance): https://www.psytoolkit.org/survey-library/spane.html

### Emotion regulation strategies (reappraisal vs suppression; scored feedback)
- PsyToolkit ERQ (Emotion Regulation Questionnaire): https://www.psytoolkit.org/survey-library/emotional-regulation-erq.html

### Trait-style “emotion skill” measurement (use carefully; debrief construct validity)
- PsyToolkit Emotional Intelligence scale (Schutte-based): https://www.psytoolkit.org/survey-library/emotional-intelligence.html

Teaching use
- Treat these as measurement labs about operationalization, reliability, and interpretation.
- Avoid making graded claims about personal emotional functioning; grade completion and methodological reflection.

Student data capture (choose one)
- One subscale score (e.g., ERQ reappraisal) plus one limitation statement.
- One difference score (e.g., SPANE-P minus SPANE-N) plus one prediction about behavior.

## Teaching designs that feel like real online labs

### Option A: 50-minute station rotation (high engagement, low setup)
- Station 1: Dot-Probe (attention bias; RT/accuracy)
- Station 2: Social Intelligence Test or RMET (emotion perception; accuracy)
- Station 3: ERQ (regulation strategies; subscale scores)
- Station 4: Micro-expressions or GGSC quiz (recognition under time pressure; score)

Whole-class synthesis prompt
- “What did each lab treat as ‘emotion skill’ (attention, recognition, regulation), and what are the tradeoffs of each operational definition?”

### Option B: Hypothesis-first mini-study (teaches scientific reasoning inside the content)
- Pre-specify a hypothesis: “Higher reappraisal scores predict higher emotion recognition accuracy (or fewer attentional-bias effects).”
- Collect: ERQ subscales + one recognition score + one Dot-Probe metric.
- Debrief: Effect size, confounds (device, distractions), and construct mismatch.

### Low-friction grading pattern (scales to large enrollments)
- One required number per lab (score or difference score).
- One required methodological sentence per lab:
  - IV (or condition difference), DV, and one validity threat.

## Practical cautions (instructional, not clinical)
- Do not require personal disclosure about trauma, depression, anxiety, or therapy experiences.
- If any activity feels personally intrusive for a student, provide a vignette-based alternative (analyze a provided “participant” result screenshot instead).

notes: "Free-only interactive teaching labs for Social Psychology. Emphasis on multiplayer social dilemmas, branching bystander scenarios, and reaction-time attitude tasks. Use neutral framing and avoid graded personal disclosure."
---

## Selection rationale
- These are free, browser-based activities designed to be *run* (not read) and are easy to debrief as social psych phenomena.
- Each activity yields a clean output you can treat as lab data: choices/payoffs, scenario decisions, or reaction-time–based categorization results.

## Lab set A: Multiplayer social dilemma labs (best for live class, high engagement)

### Economics Games (free, ready to play, nothing to install, no registration)
- Games hub (launch and generate student access): https://economics-games.com/games citeturn1search1
- Repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma (cooperate vs compete; repeated rounds): https://economics-games.com/prisoner-dilemma citeturn0search4
- Public Good Financing Experiment (contribute vs free-ride; repeated rounds): https://economics-games.com/public-good citeturn1search6
- Tragedy of the Commons (shared resource harvesting; repeated rounds): https://economics-games.com/tragedy-commons citeturn1search2
- oTree games pack on the same platform (Ultimatum and other interaction games): https://economics-games.com/otree citeturn1search8

Why this works as a social-psych lab
- You can operationalize social concepts directly: cooperation, reciprocity, norm enforcement, trust, fairness, and collective action problems.

Easy data capture
- One number per student per game (final payoff, average contribution, or cooperation rate across rounds).
- One class-level pattern (mean contribution by round; cooperation rate after betrayal; resource collapse time).

## Lab set B: Bystander effect and social influence (branching scenario lab)

### MIT Active Bystanders interactive scenarios (choose options, see consequences)
- Interactive scenarios hub: https://web.mit.edu/bystanders/interactive/index.html citeturn0search1

Why this works as a social-psych lab
- This is a structured decision-path lab: students choose actions, observe outcomes, and can analyze barriers to intervention (diffusion of responsibility, fear of evaluation, ambiguity).

Easy data capture
- Require one screenshot of the decision path taken plus one coded label:
  - “direct intervention,” “delegation,” “distraction,” “delay,” or “no action.”

## Lab set C: Attitudes, prejudice, and implicit cognition (reaction-time lab)

### Project Implicit IAT (students select a topic; timed categorization; immediate feedback)
- Take an IAT (computer): https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html citeturn1search0
- Blindspot-hosted Race IAT direct entry (useful when you want everyone on the same task): https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/user/agg/blindspot/indexrk.htm citeturn1search23

Why this works as a social-psych lab
- It is a rare intro-level activity that behaves like a real cognitive task: timed trials, measurable performance, and a direct bridge to attitude measurement and social cognition.

Easy data capture
- Do not grade on “result direction.” Grade on:
  - completion confirmation + one methodological reflection: “What could distort RT-based measures?”

## Lab set D: Build-your-own interactive group experiment (free platform; more instructor setup)

### LIONESS Lab (free web-based platform for interactive online experiments)
- Platform: https://lioness-lab.org/ citeturn0search2
- Documentation: https://lioness-doc.readthedocs.io/ citeturn0search10

Why this works as a teaching lab
- If you want *true* interactive social experiments (group formation, synchronous interaction, dropout handling), LIONESS is purpose-built for that. citeturn0search6

Best use in PSY-132 (pragmatic)
- Use LIONESS when you want a “capstone lab day” with one carefully chosen interactive experiment rather than many small demos.

## Teaching ideas (concrete, low-friction)

### Option A: 50-minute live class “social dilemmas” lab (high yield)
- Run Public Good for 6–8 rounds.
- Then run Prisoner’s Dilemma for 6–8 rounds.
- Debrief:
  - What changed across rounds?
  - Did cooperation stabilize, collapse, or oscillate?
  - What informal norms emerged (punishment, forgiveness, retaliation)?

Minimal grading artifact
- One number (average contribution OR cooperation rate) + one paragraph interpreting the pattern.

### Option B: 50-minute “bystander decision lab” (good for discussion sections)
- Students complete one MIT scenario individually.
- In small groups, compare paths and code each decision into a strategy category.
- Whole-class synthesis:
  - identify the most common failure point (where intervention stops).

Minimal grading artifact
- One screenshot + one coded category + one “what would you do differently and why” sentence.

### Option C: Asynchronous online lab (works in D2L without coordination)
- Assign one IAT topic (same for everyone).
- Require:
  - completion, plus
  - one paragraph on construct validity, demand characteristics, device differences, and interpretation limits.

Minimal grading artifact
- A standardized “methods debrief” template response (same prompts for everyone).

### Lab-to-stats bridge (reuse in Topic 4)
- Public Goods: graph mean contribution by round and discuss trends, variability, and outliers.
- Prisoner’s Dilemma: compute cooperation rate and compare sections (difference in proportions).
- IAT: discuss measurement noise, reaction-time distributions, and why median often beats mean.
```

notes: "All links below are selected for lab-style teaching: students generate scored outputs (subscales, percentiles, difference scores) that support measurement-focused debriefs. Grade completion and methods reflection, not trait levels."
---

## Selection rationale
- Free and student-facing.
- Interactive in the lab sense: produces scores, subscales, or percentile feedback that can be analyzed.
- Supports Intro Psych goals: traits, measurement, reliability and validity, response bias, and trait versus state.

## Core lab hubs (reusable all semester)

### PsyToolkit survey library (ready-to-run peer-reviewed scales with scoring)
- Survey library hub: https://www.psytoolkit.org/survey-library/

### Open-Source Psychometrics Project (interactive tests with results pages and percentiles)
- Test hub: https://openpsychometrics.org/

### Personality Assessor (free Big Five tests with facets)
- Big Five Inventory 2 (BFI-2) test: https://www.personalityassessor.com/bigfive/

## Lab set A: Big Five traits (the anchor personality lab)

### Very short Big Five (good for same-day class dataset)
- PsyToolkit TIPI (10 items): https://www.psytoolkit.org/survey-library/big5-tipi.html

Use case
- Fast in-class measurement lab and quick introduction to operationalizing traits.

### Short but more stable Big Five (better for debrief)
- PsyToolkit BFI-S (15 items): https://www.psytoolkit.org/survey-library/big5-bfi-s.html

Use case
- Better signal than TIPI while still short enough for a lab day.

### Full Big Five with percentiles (useful for interpreting norms and distributions)
- OpenPsychometrics IPIP Big Five Factor Markers: https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/
- Results page format (percentiles and raw scores): https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/results.php

Use case
- Best for a “what does a score mean” discussion and for showing percentiles.

### Big Five with facets (shows how broad traits break down)
- Personality Assessor BFI-2 (domains plus facets): https://www.personalityassessor.com/bigfive/

Use case
- Strong for demonstrating that “Agreeableness” is a bundle of narrower tendencies.

## Lab set B: Self-concept and control beliefs (classic trait-adjacent measures)

### Self-esteem: trait versus state comparison lab
- PsyToolkit Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (trait-leaning): https://www.psytoolkit.org/survey-library/self-esteem-rosenberg.html
- PsyToolkit State Self-Esteem Scale (facets; momentary): https://www.psytoolkit.org/survey-library/self-esteem-sses.html

Use case
- Students compare score stability logic and interpret why state measures can shift with context.

### Locus of control and perceived control (clean for prediction and debrief)
- PsyToolkit Rotter Locus of Control: https://www.psytoolkit.org/survey-library/locus-of-control-rotter.html
- PsyToolkit Spheres of Control Scale (domain-specific control): https://www.psytoolkit.org/survey-library/spheres-of-control-scale.html

Use case
- Demonstrates that “control” can differ by life domain, which reduces simplistic trait interpretations.

## Lab set C: Persistence and self-regulation as measurable traits

### Grit (works as a measurement and prediction lab)
- PsyToolkit Short Grit Scale (Grit-S): https://www.psytoolkit.org/survey-library/grit-short.html

Use case
- Pairs well with later discussions of motivation, achievement, and confounds.

## Teaching ideas that keep this lab-like

## Option A: Measurement lab day (50 minutes, minimal setup)
- Step 1: Run TIPI or BFI-S for everyone.
- Step 2: Run Rosenberg and State Self-Esteem back-to-back.
- Step 3: Run Rotter Locus of Control.
- Step 4: Students submit three numbers and one methods note:
  - Big Five: one trait score (or two if you prefer)
  - Self-esteem: trait score and state score
  - Locus of control: internal-external score
  - One validity threat (device, distractions, response bias, misunderstanding items)

Debrief prompts
- What is the construct and what is the operational definition here.
- What would change if the instructions asked for “answer honestly” versus “answer like an ideal job applicant.”
- Which measure looks most sensitive to immediate context and why.

## Option B: Response-bias lab (very teachable, low risk)
- Randomly assign half the class:
  - Condition 1: answer honestly
  - Condition 2: answer as if applying for a competitive scholarship or job
- Use BFI-S or Rosenberg.
- Compare class distributions by condition.

Debrief prompts
- What kind of bias does the instruction manipulation induce.
- What does that imply about self-report measurement in personality research.

## Option C: Reliability mini-lab (makes “traits are stable” concrete)
- Run BFI-S in Week A and again in Week B.
- Students compute a simple stability index for one trait:
  - absolute difference between Week A and Week B
- Aggregate differences and discuss measurement error and stability.

## Easy grading pattern that scales
- Grade completion and the methods reflection.
- Avoid grading on trait levels or requiring personal explanations.
- Allow an opt-out alternative: analyze a provided “participant results” screenshot instead of submitting personal scores.

---

## Selection rationale
- Every activity below is interactive and produces an output you can treat as lab data: reaction time feedback, a score profile, or a coded text result.
- The set covers three complementary lab modes that work well in Intro Psych.
- Cognitive task lab (implicit association).
- Measurement lab (gender-role and gender-attitude scales).
- Applied language lab (gender-coded wording in real texts).

## Lab set A: Implicit gender stereotypes as a timed cognitive task (reaction-time lab)

### Gender–Career / Family Implicit Association Test (direct entry)
- Gender–Career IAT (Blindspot entry): https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/user/agg/blindspot/indexgc.htm

### General IAT selector (if you want students to choose from the menu)
- Take an IAT (computer): https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html
- Take an IAT (touch/tablet): https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatouchtestv2.html

Teaching use
- Treat this as a measurement lab about reaction-time categorization under different pairing rules.
- Debrief what the task is optimized to measure, and what it is not optimized to measure.

Student data capture options
- Completion confirmation plus screenshot of the final feedback screen.
- One methodological reflection sentence: device type, distractions, prior familiarity, speed–accuracy tradeoff.

## Lab set B: Gender roles and gender expression as measurable constructs (scored survey labs)

### Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI) on PsyToolkit (classic role-endorsement measure)
- BSRI (PsyToolkit): https://www.psytoolkit.org/survey-library/sex-role-bem.html

### Open Sex-Role Inventory (OSRI) on OpenPsychometrics (two-scale masculinity and femininity output)
- OSRI start page: https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/OSRI/
- OSRI interactive item stream (direct): https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/OSRI/1.php

Teaching use
- Compare how BSRI and OSRI operationalize gendered traits.
- Focus on construct definition and the difference between gender identity and endorsement of gender-role stereotypes.

Student data capture options
- Two subscale scores only, no narrative explanation.
- One sentence labeling a validity limitation of gender-role inventories.

## Lab set C: Gender attitudes as measurable beliefs (scored attitude lab)

### Feminist Perspectives Scale (FPS) on OpenPsychometrics
- FPS (interactive): https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/FPS.php

Teaching use
- Treat as an attitudes measurement lab.
- Focus on how item wording, social desirability, and context shape responding.

Student data capture options
- Total score plus one statement about response bias risk.

## Lab set D: Gender-coded language in texts (applied analysis lab)

### Gender Decoder (paste text, get coded-word counts and an overall classification)
- Gender Decoder tool: https://gender-decoder.katmatfield.com/
- About (method and word lists): https://gender-decoder.katmatfield.com/about
- FAQ (interpretation guardrails): https://gender-decoder.katmatfield.com/faq

Teaching use
- Run as a “language operationalization” lab.
- Students test multiple texts and compare how coding shifts with edits.

Student data capture options
- One before-and-after screenshot showing the coded-word counts.
- One sentence identifying the independent variable as the edit and the dependent variable as the coded-word balance.

## Optional instructor-preview lab (content can be inflammatory, use with care)

### Hypermasculinity Values Questionnaire (HVQ) on PsyToolkit
- HVQ (PsyToolkit): https://www.psytoolkit.org/survey-library/hypermasculinity-hvq.html

Teaching use
- Use only if you want to explicitly discuss hostile gender norms and socialization.
- Provide an opt-out alternative by default.

## Teaching designs and ideas

## Option A: 50-minute station rotation (high engagement, minimal setup)
- Station 1: Gender–Career IAT
- Station 2: BSRI or OSRI (pick one for time)
- Station 3: Gender Decoder (text analysis)
- Station 4: FPS attitude scale (optional if time allows)

Whole-class synthesis
- What is each lab measuring.
- What is each lab not measuring.
- How would two students reach similar outputs for different reasons.

## Option B: Methods-first mini-study (teaches research logic inside the topic)
- Pre-specify a hypothesis in class:
  - Higher endorsement of traditional gender roles predicts stronger gender–career pairing effects.
- Collect only minimal variables:
  - One gender-role score and one IAT completion screenshot.
- Debrief threats to validity:
  - device differences, distractions, social desirability, and construct mismatch.

## Low-friction grading pattern that scales
- Grade completion and a short methods reflection.
- Require one numeric output per activity and one sentence labeling IV and DV.
- Provide an alternative assignment: interpret a provided results screenshot instead of generating personal results.

---

## Selection rationale
- Free, browser-based activities that students can actually run.
- Outputs you can treat as data: reaction time feedback, scale scores, country comparisons, or interactive cross-tabs.
- Supports Intro Psych goals: operationalizing culture, avoiding essentialism, and separating within-group variability from between-group averages.

## Lab set A: Implicit cultural associations (timed cognitive task; measurable output)
- Project Implicit: Take an IAT (computer): https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html
- Project Implicit: Take an IAT (alternate selector page): https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatestv2.html
- About the IAT (for debrief framing): https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/iatdetails.html

Teaching use
- Treat as a measurement lab: timed categorization under different pairing rules.
- Use culturally relevant topics (race, skin tone, religion, nationality) based on what the menu currently offers.

Student data capture (low risk)
- Screenshot of the completion/feedback screen plus one methods paragraph:
  - device type, distractions, speed–accuracy tradeoff, and one limitation of RT-based measures.

## Lab set B: Cross-cultural communication style (scored output; interpretation lab)
- Lab in the Wild: High-Context vs Low-Context Communication test: https://studies.labinthewild.org/highlow/
- Lab in the Wild hub (optional additional studies): https://labinthewild.org/

Teaching use
- Use as a “construct operationalization” lab: communication style as a measurable dimension.
- Debrief why the construct is probabilistic (not a label for individuals or whole cultures).

Student data capture
- One score/output statement plus one “context caveat” sentence:
  - “What part of your life context might push you more high- or low-context?”

## Lab set C: Cross-national values and norms (interactive dataset analysis; real survey data)
- World Values Survey Online Data Analysis tool: https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSOnline.jsp

Teaching use
- This is your strongest “data lab” for multicultural content:
  - students choose a wave, pick a variable, compare countries, and interpret patterns.
- Debrief sampling, measurement equivalence, and the “mean vs distribution” problem.

Student data capture
- Require one exportable artifact:
  - screenshot of the comparison table/plot plus the exact question/variable label and selected countries.

## Lab set D: Cross-national attitudes question search (interactive item bank; build a mini-study)
- Pew Research Center: International Question Search: https://www.pewresearch.org/international-question-search/

Teaching use
- Run as a “survey design lab”:
  - students locate one recurring cross-national item (e.g., trust, immigration, religion, gender roles), then propose a hypothesis and identify which countries/years to compare.
- Debrief wording effects and comparability across translations/cultures.

Student data capture
- One item prompt plus one proposed operational definition:
  - what is the DV, what are the comparison groups, and what confound is most likely.

## Lab set E: Cultural-dimensions comparison (interactive visualization; debrief carefully)
- Hofstede-based country comparison bar charts (interactive tool): https://geerthofstede.com/country-comparison-bar-charts/
- Optional alternate view: country comparison graphs (2-D + color shading): https://geerthofstede.com/country-comparison-graphs/
- Optional interactive globe: Hofstede’s Globe: https://geerthofstede.com/hofstedes-globe/

Teaching use
- Use only as a modeling/visualization lab, not as “explaining individuals.”
- Debrief ecological fallacy and within-country variance (country averages are not people).

Student data capture
- Pick 3 countries and capture:
  - one screenshot + one claim written as a conditional and a limitation statement.

## Lab set F: Moral values geography and variation (interactive map + optional test)
- MapYourMorals (interactive moral geography map): https://map.yourmorals.org/
- YourMorals (optional: take a scale; requires registration): https://www.yourmorals.org/

Teaching use
- Use to teach within-culture variability:
  - regional clusters, prediction uncertainty, and the danger of “culture as monolith.”
- Pair with WVS to contrast within-country vs between-country comparisons.

Student data capture
- One map screenshot + one interpretation sentence that avoids overgeneralization:
  - “This shows a modeled estimate for region-level patterns; it does not determine any individual’s values.”

## Teaching designs and ideas

## Option A: 50-minute station rotation (high engagement, minimal setup)
- Station 1: IAT (implicit associations and measurement limits).
- Station 2: High/Low Context test (construct measurement).
- Station 3: WVS Online Analysis (country comparison with real survey data).
- Station 4: Pew International Question Search (build a hypothesis and identify a testable comparison).

Deliverable (simple, scalable)
- One screenshot per station plus one “IV/DV + limitation” sentence per station.

## Option B: One-week asynchronous online lab (D2L-friendly)
- Students complete WVS Online Analysis using a provided checklist:
  - choose wave, choose variable, pick 4 countries, record pattern, state one confound.
- Students then use Pew Question Search to find a related item and predict whether it would match the WVS pattern.

Deliverable
- Two screenshots and a short methods paragraph comparing the two sources.

## Option C: Mini-study that teaches inference without claiming causal culture effects
- Pre-specify:
  - “Country-level values will correlate with country-level attitudes, but the relationship will vary by region and item wording.”
- Use WVS for values and Pew for attitudes; compare whether patterns align.
- Debrief:
  - correlation vs causation, ecological fallacy, measurement equivalence.

## Debrief prompts that force lab thinking
- What is the independent variable (country, wave, condition, item wording, task pairing)?
- What is the dependent variable (score, RT feedback, response distribution, comparison statistic)?
- What is one alternative explanation (translation, sampling, selection bias, device differences, demand characteristics)?
- What claim would be invalid because it jumps from group averages to individual people?

notes: "These are teaching labs, not diagnosis. Default grading should be completion + methods reasoning. Provide an opt-out alternative that uses a provided vignette or screenshot instead of personal responses."
---

## Selection rationale
- Free, browser-based interactivity that behaves like a lab: students produce measurable outputs (scores, subscales, reaction-time feedback, or structured decision results).
- Supports Intro Psych learning goals: operational definitions, symptom measurement, screening versus diagnosis, base rates, false positives/negatives, stigma, and ethics.

## Instructor framing that keeps this academically safe
- Treat all outputs as demonstrations of measurement and screening logic, not as clinical conclusions.
- Avoid requiring personal disclosure. Offer a “vignette mode” option:
  - students score a provided mock response set, or
  - students analyze a provided screenshot of results.
- Grade method and reasoning, not score direction or severity.

## Lab set A: Symptom screening as a measurement lab (interactive, scored outputs)

### Mental Health America screening tools (pick the tests you want the class to run)
- Screening tools hub: https://screening.mhanational.org/screening-tools/
- Depression test: https://screening.mhanational.org/screening-tools/depression/
- Anxiety test: https://screening.mhanational.org/screening-tools/anxiety/
- Bipolar test: https://screening.mhanational.org/screening-tools/bipolar/
- PTSD test: https://screening.mhanational.org/screening-tools/ptsd/
- Psychosis & Schizophrenia test (PQ-B): https://screening.mhanational.org/screening-tools/psychosis/

How this functions like a lab
- Students experience how “symptoms” become scored items and cut-scores.
- You can teach screening logic: sensitivity/specificity, base rate problems, and why screens require follow-up.

Minimal data capture
- One score (or “risk category”) + one limitation statement:
  - “This is a screening tool; only trained clinicians diagnose.”

## Lab set B: Classic clinical scales with explicit scoring (teaching-friendly, research-adjacent)

### PsyToolkit survey library (free; scored scales; good for structured debrief)
- Survey library hub: https://www.psytoolkit.org/survey-library/
- PHQ-9 (depression severity): https://www.psytoolkit.org/survey-library/depression-phq.html
- GAD-7 (anxiety severity): https://www.psytoolkit.org/survey-library/anxiety-gad7.html
- DASS-21 (depression/anxiety/stress): https://www.psytoolkit.org/survey-library/dass21.html
- OCI-R (OCD symptom domains): https://www.psytoolkit.org/survey-library/obsessiveness-oci-r.html

How this functions like a lab
- Students compare instruments (single-construct vs multi-construct) and see how scoring rules affect interpretation.
- You can teach reliability/validity at an intro level by comparing how different measures “slice” distress.

Minimal data capture
- One subscale score (or total score) + one “threat to validity”:
  - device distractions, interpretation of items, social desirability, or transient state effects.

## Lab set C: Stigma and implicit attitudes about mental illness (reaction-time lab)

### Project Implicit Health (mental health IATs)
- Mental Health IATs hub: https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/user/pih/pih/mentalhealthiats.html
- Project Implicit Health (general entry): https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/user/pih/pih/index.jsp
- Project Implicit Health (alternate “take a test” route): https://www.projectimplicithealth.com/selectiat_desktop.html

How this functions like a lab
- Students see a timed categorization task (not a self-report scale) and learn why RT measures have different limitations than questionnaires.

Minimal data capture
- Completion confirmation + one methods paragraph:
  - device type, distractions, speed–accuracy tradeoff, and one interpretation limit.

## Lab set D: Symptom-experience simulation (strong lab impact; instructor preview recommended)

### Auditory hallucination simulation (STARR Coalition)
- Simulation landing page: https://thestarr.org/ahs/
- Module page: https://thestarr.org/module/auditory-hallucination-simulation/

How this functions like a lab
- Students experience a controlled manipulation (simulated perceptual input) and observe downstream performance effects (attention, frustration, task completion).
- Best for connecting “symptom” to functional impairment and environmental supports.

Minimal data capture
- One structured observation + one accommodation:
  - “What task became harder?” and “What environmental change would reduce impairment?”

## Optional lab add-on (screening, not diagnosis)
- VA National Center for PTSD: PTSD self-screen: https://www.ptsd.va.gov/screen/

## Teaching designs and ideas

## Option A: 50-minute station rotation (high engagement, low setup)
- Station 1: PHQ-9 or DASS-21 (measurement and scoring)
- Station 2: OCI-R (symptom domains and heterogeneity)
- Station 3: Psychosis PQ-B (screening logic and false positives)
- Station 4: Mental Illness IAT (stigma measurement)
- Station 5: Auditory hallucination simulation (function and accommodation)

Deliverable
- One numeric output per station + one sentence labeling:
  - what was measured, and one limitation.

## Option B: Screening-versus-diagnosis mini-study (methods-first)
- Provide 2–3 fictional vignettes.
- Students choose one tool (MHA or PsyToolkit scale) and justify:
  - why it fits the vignette,
  - what it cannot conclude,
  - what follow-up information would be needed for diagnosis.

Deliverable
- Tool choice + scored result + a short “next data needed” list.

## Option C: Build a class dataset for Topic 4 (Statistics) later
- Use only de-identified metrics:
  - PHQ-9 total, GAD-7 total, OCI-R total, PQ-B endorsed count.
- In statistics week:
  - compare distributions, discuss skew, and show why cut-scores can misclassify when base rates are low.

## Debrief prompts that force lab thinking
- What is the operational definition of “severity” in this tool?
- What is the likely source of measurement error?
- What base-rate assumption is hiding under your interpretation?
- What ethical constraint applies if this were a real class study?

notes: "These are teaching labs, not clinical care. Grade completion and methodological reasoning. Default to vignette-based responses and offer an opt-out alternative for any self-applied tool."
---

## Selection rationale
- Free, browser-based interactivity that behaves like a lab: students make choices, follow branches, complete structured exercises, and produce outputs you can debrief.
- Emphasis on therapy process skills (therapeutic communication, case formulation moves, CBT skill practice explained as operational steps).
- Output is easy to grade without personal disclosure: choice paths, short artifacts (exports), and one-method paragraph.

## Lab set A: Branching “therapy process” simulations (best fit for teaching interactively)

### OpenRN Virtual Simulations (H5P; Creative Commons; reusable in an LMS)
- Scenario list hub: https://www.wistechopen.org/open-rn-virtual-simulations
- OpenRN simulations collection (LibreStudio collection landing page): https://studio.libretexts.org/collection/9229

Recommended OpenRN therapeutic communication scenarios (CC BY)
- Therapeutic Communication – Schizophrenia: https://studio.libretexts.org/h5p/8691
- Therapeutic Communication – Substance Use: https://studio.libretexts.org/h5p/8704
- Therapeutic Communication – Cultural Competency: https://studio.libretexts.org/h5p/8694
- Therapeutic Communication – Sexual Orientation: https://studio.libretexts.org/h5p/8707
- Therapeutic Communication – Pediatric Separation Anxiety: https://studio.libretexts.org/h5p/8692

How this functions like a therapy lab
- Students practice decision points that mirror clinical process (rapport, reflection, validation, boundary setting, harm reduction language).
- Debrief focuses on process: what the “helper” did, what it signaled, and what it changed in the interaction.

Student data capture (low risk)
- One screenshot of the final outcome screen or the choice path.
- One coded label for the primary strategy used:
  - reflection, open question, affirmation, summary, boundary, referral, safety check.

## Lab set B: Build-your-own branching scenario lab (useful when you want exact alignment to Intro Psych)

### H5P Branching Scenario (free HTML5 content type)
- Content type overview: https://h5p.org/branching-scenario
- Example branching scenario (Skills Practice: A Home Visit): https://h5p.org/h5p/embed/439819

How this functions like a teaching lab
- You can create a “micro-therapy” decision lab using fictional vignettes (CBT, MI, supportive counseling), then branch based on student choices.
- This supports evaluation of clinical reasoning without requiring student self-disclosure.

Instructor build idea (minimal)
- One vignette, 5–7 decision points, 2–3 endings.
- Label each decision with the intended skill (OARS, CBT guided discovery move, boundary/safety check).
- Add a final reflection prompt: “Name the skill and the hypothesized mechanism.”

## Lab set C: CBT skills as structured “artifact labs” (students produce a concrete work product)

### Thought record (cognitive restructuring)
- Free CBT Thought Record Worksheet (interactive; export): https://bohangar.com/cbt-thought-record/

Suggested teaching use
- Provide a fictional trigger scenario and a pre-written “automatic thought.”
- Students complete the record using the vignette, then export and submit.

Grading-friendly output
- Exported text file or screenshot.
- One sentence identifying the cognitive distortion or core belief being challenged.

### Exposure planning (graded steps; behavioral treatment planning)
- Exposure Ladder Builder (interactive; export): https://bohangar.com/exposure-ladder-tool/

Suggested teaching use
- Assign a non-sensitive target (public speaking, test anxiety, elevator avoidance, phone calls).
- Students create a 6–10 step ladder with SUDS ratings and a safety plan.

Grading-friendly output
- Ladder screenshot or export.
- One sentence naming the mechanism: extinction/inhibitory learning and reduced avoidance.

### Cognitive distortions practice (classification + reframe prompt)
- Cognitive Distortions Quiz & Coach (interactive; export): https://bohangar.com/cognitive-distortions-quiz-coach-free-cbt-tool/

Suggested teaching use
- Use as a “spot the distortion” station, then require one reframe.
- Keep it vignette-based by providing a list of sample thoughts to evaluate.

Grading-friendly output
- One distortion label + one balanced alternative thought.

## Lab set D: Optional scored “skills check” (use as measurement/debrief, not as authority)

### Cognitive distortions test (scored output)
- IDRlabs Cognitive Distortions Test: https://www.idrlabs.com/cognitive-distortions/test.php

Suggested teaching use
- Use only as a prompt for measurement critique:
  - what is being measured, what is the reference group, what is the validity claim.

Grading-friendly output
- One score category plus one limitation statement (construct validity, response bias, and interpretability).

## Teaching designs and ideas

## Option A: 50-minute station rotation (high engagement, low setup)
- Station 1: OpenRN Therapeutic Communication scenario (pick one).
- Station 2: Thought record (vignette-based).
- Station 3: Exposure ladder (non-sensitive target).
- Station 4: Cognitive distortions coach (apply to provided sample thoughts).
- Whole-class synthesis: “What changed behavior or thinking in each lab, and what mechanism explains that change?”

Deliverable
- One artifact per station (screenshot/export) plus one “skill + mechanism” sentence.

## Option B: Asynchronous online lab (works in D2L without coordination)
- Students complete one OpenRN scenario.
- Students complete one CBT artifact lab (thought record or exposure ladder) using a provided vignette.
- Students submit:
  - the artifact,
  - a short paragraph naming the therapy orientation and mechanism,
  - one alternative explanation or limitation.

## Option C: Treatment matching mini-lab (builds evidence-based thinking without clinical claims)
- Provide three fictional cases (panic, depression, substance use).
- Students choose:
  - one OpenRN scenario for process skills, plus
  - one CBT artifact tool that fits the case.
- Debrief focuses on match quality and mechanism, not on “diagnosing.”

## Debrief prompts that keep it lab-like
- What was the independent variable (choice made, step taken, reframe used)?
- What was the dependent variable (scenario outcome, SUDS plan, re-rated emotion, quality of client response)?
- What mechanism is claimed (reinforcement, cognitive change, exposure learning, alliance/process factors)?
- What limitation matters (measurement, generalizability, demand characteristics, context)?

notes: "Mechanical checklist for deciding whether a link qualifies as a free, student-facing, teaching-interactive lab for PSY-132."
---

## Purpose
Use this checklist to decide whether a web resource qualifies for inclusion in PSY-132 as an interactive teaching lab link under a strict “free only” constraint.

## Definition
A qualifying link is a student-facing activity that runs with low friction and produces an output that supports a lab-style debrief, including independent variables, dependent variables, and validity limitations.

## Acceptance test checklist

## A. Access and cost
- The activity is free for students to run without a paid license, paid code, or institution subscription.
- The activity does not require a paywall after a short demo that would block normal completion.
- The activity does not require installation of proprietary software as a condition of completion.
  - Mobile apps may be included only if a web alternative does not exist and the app is free.

## B. Friction and compatibility
- The activity runs in a modern browser on common student devices.
  - It should work on at least one of: Chromebook, Windows laptop, Mac laptop, iOS, Android.
- The activity does not require deprecated plugins or runtimes.
  - Exclude Java applets, Flash, and similar legacy dependencies.
- The activity works without requiring account creation.
  - If an account is required, include only if the activity is unusually high value and the account is free and low-friction.

## C. Interactivity threshold
- The student must actively do something beyond reading or watching.
  - Examples: respond to stimuli, manipulate parameters, make repeated choices, drag-and-drop, complete a branching scenario.
- The activity includes at least one of:
  - timed responses
  - repeated trials
  - parameter manipulation with visible outcome changes
  - decision branches with consequences
  - structured item responses with scoring

## D. Lab output requirement
At least one of the following must be produced, and it must be recordable:
- reaction time, accuracy, error rate, or trial feedback
- a score or subscale profile with scoring rules or interpretability cues
- a graph or model output that changes when parameters change
- a decision path plus an outcome screen
- a coded text result with counts or classifications

## E. Debriefability
- The activity supports a clean identification of:
  - what can function as an independent variable, even if implicit in conditions or trial types
  - what is measured as the dependent variable
- The activity supports at least one standard intro-psych validity discussion:
  - measurement error
  - construct validity
  - demand characteristics
  - sampling/selection bias
  - confounds such as device differences, distractions, or prior familiarity

## F. Classroom scalability
- Students can complete the activity in a predictable time window.
  - Default target: 5–20 minutes for an in-class station.
  - Longer activities are acceptable only if they are clearly worth a full lab day.
- The activity supports simple submission evidence with minimal disputes.
  - Preferred: one screenshot of results plus one numeric or categorical output.
- The activity does not require synchronous coordination unless it is explicitly a multiplayer class experiment.
  - If synchronous, it must have an instructor-run flow that works in a typical class session.

## G. Safety and student privacy
- The activity does not require students to disclose personal mental health information, trauma, substance use, or sensitive life history for grading.
- If the activity is a self-report scale on sensitive content, inclusion requires:
  - default vignette-based option, or
  - opt-out alternative using a provided screenshot or mock dataset
  - grading based on completion and methods reasoning, not score level
- The activity includes no manipulative persuasion, harassment, or content that would reasonably create harm without clear instructor framing.
  - If content could be disturbing, label it instructor-preview and require an opt-out path.

## Decision rule
- Include the link if it passes all of A, C, D, and G, and at least three of B, E, and F.
- Exclude the link if it fails any of A, C, D, or G.

## Required metadata for each included link
- Link title
- URL
- Activity type
  - cognitive task, simulation, branching scenario, scored scale, multiplayer experiment, interactive dataset tool, text-coding tool
- Output type
  - RT/accuracy, score/subscales, graph/model, decision path, coded counts
- Typical completion time estimate
- Submission evidence format
  - screenshot, numeric output, brief reflection
- Notes for instructor framing
  - required caveats and any opt-out alternative

notes: "History rarely produces reaction-time data, so the lab outputs here are coded responses, timeline choices, scavenger-hunt answers, and artifact analyses. Grade completion plus methods reasoning, not opinions."
---

## Selection rationale
- Free, browser-based resources that students actively navigate, classify, and extract evidence from
- Activities produce recordable outputs suitable for grading at scale
- Designed to support debriefs about how the field changed over time and why

## Interactive teaching labs

## Lab 1: Interactive timeline scavenger hunt (Annenberg Learner)
- Link
  - https://www.learner.org/series/discovering-psychology/explorations/history-of-psychology-contemporary-foundations/
- Activity type
  - Interactive timeline exploration
- Output type
  - Coded event selections and short written evidence claims
- Typical completion time
  - 10–20 minutes
- Submission evidence format
  - Screenshot of two selected timeline entries
  - Three-item response set: date, person or concept, why it matters
- Instructor framing notes
  - Require students to label each entry as one of: method shift, theory shift, institutional milestone, applied use case

## Lab 2: Interactive institutional timeline (APA History and Archives)
- Link
  - https://www.apa.org/about/apa/archives/timeline
- Activity type
  - Interactive timeline with milestone filtering
- Output type
  - Event selection plus classification code
- Typical completion time
  - 10–15 minutes
- Submission evidence format
  - Screenshot of one milestone
  - One-paragraph “context note” using only what is on the page
- Instructor framing notes
  - Use to teach the difference between “psychology as a science” and “psychology as a profession”

## Lab 3: Online exhibits with built-in classroom activities (Cummings Center, University of Akron)
- Link
  - https://www.uakron.edu/chp/education/online-exhibits
- Activity type
  - Curated exhibit plus attached teaching resources
- Output type
  - Scavenger hunt answers and primary-source evidence extraction
- Typical completion time
  - 20–30 minutes per exhibit
- Submission evidence format
  - One completed scavenger hunt page or answer set
  - One “source card” with: artifact title, what it is, what claim it supports
- Instructor framing notes
  - Require students to separate description from interpretation
  - Description: what the artifact literally shows
  - Interpretation: what it suggests about psychology at the time

## Lab 4: Museum scavenger hunt as a structured history lab (National Museum of Psychology)
- Core museum page
  - https://www.uakron.edu/chp/museum/
- Scavenger hunt PDF
  - https://www.uakron.edu/chp/images/ScavengerHunt_short_final2018.pdf
- Educator guide PDF
  - https://www.uakron.edu/chp/museum/A%20Guide%20for%20Educators_National%20Museum%20of%20Psychology%20-%202022%20Edit.pdf?language_id=1
- Activity type
  - Guided artifact search and matching task
- Output type
  - Completed matching and short-response prompts
- Typical completion time
  - 20–40 minutes
- Submission evidence format
  - Photo or scan of completed scavenger hunt page
  - One “most surprising exhibit” note with a single supported claim
- Instructor framing notes
  - This works in-person or virtual if you provide screenshots of a few exhibits

## Lab 5: Curated collection lab (Smithsonian Learning Lab)
- Link
  - https://learninglab.si.edu/collections/exploring-heredity-race-eugenics-and-the-history-of-intelligence-testing/ytlaOzLVuq36ejHP
- Activity type
  - Curated collection navigation and annotation
- Output type
  - Item selection plus evidence-based critique
- Typical completion time
  - 20–30 minutes
- Submission evidence format
  - Select two items and submit a “two-column analysis”
  - Column 1: what the item is
  - Column 2: what claim it supports or complicates
- Instructor framing notes
  - Require a bias and ethics note: “What harm could follow from misusing this idea or tool?”

## Lab 6: Artifact analysis lab (Barnard Psychology Virtual Museum)
- Link
  - https://psychology.barnard.edu/psych-psych-virtual-museum
- Activity type
  - Artifact browsing and structured analysis
- Output type
  - “instrument inference” worksheet
- Typical completion time
  - 15–25 minutes
- Submission evidence format
  - Choose one apparatus and answer four prompts
  - What is it
  - What might it measure
  - What assumption about mind or behavior is embedded in it
  - What would count as good evidence in that paradigm
- Instructor framing notes
  - This is a clean bridge into Topic 3 Research Methods

## Lab 7: Micro-history lessons with scavenger hunts (Cummings Center 5 Minute History Lessons)
- Hub
  - https://www.uakron.edu/chp/education/videos.dot
- Example teacher guide PDF
  - https://www.uakron.edu/chp/education/pdfs/Episode7_TeachersGuide_5MHL.pdf
- Activity type
  - Short video plus scavenger hunt and discussion prompts
- Output type
  - Completed scavenger hunt plus one synthesis claim
- Typical completion time
  - 15–25 minutes
- Submission evidence format
  - Completed scavenger hunt answers
  - One sentence linking the episode to a broader trend in psychology
- Instructor framing notes
  - Use these as “history in small doses” throughout the semester, not only in Topic 1

## Teaching designs and ideas

## Option A: One 50-minute “history as evidence” lab day
- Warm-up: Annenberg timeline scavenger hunt
- Main: One Akron online exhibit with its teaching resource
- Wrap: One method statement
  - “How did psychology try to make its claims credible in this era?”

## Option B: Station rotation (works in any classroom with devices)
- Station 1: Annenberg timeline
- Station 2: APA timeline
- Station 3: Akron online exhibit
- Station 4: Barnard apparatus analysis
- Station 5: Smithsonian Learning Lab collection

Grading pattern
- One screenshot per station
- One coded classification per station
- One limitation per station, such as “this artifact does not show X”

## Option C: Asynchronous lab (D2L-friendly)
- Students complete exactly one exhibit-based lab (Akron or Smithsonian)
- Students submit:
  - one artifact “source card”
  - one paragraph explaining how that artifact reflects a historical assumption in psychology

## Debrief prompts that force lab thinking
- What is the “independent variable” in the history story
  - changed methods, changed institutions, changed technology, changed social context
- What is the “dependent variable”
  - what psychologists measured, what counts as evidence, what gets published or funded
- What is one alternative explanation
  - social forces, war, migration policy, technology limits, academic incentives
- What is one ethical hazard
  - who gets harmed when a tool or theory is misapplied

notes: "This topic is best taught as a set of short labs where each activity embodies one perspective. Grade classification and reasoning, not personal results."
---

## Selection rationale
- Perspectives are conceptual lenses, so the most teachable “lab” format is repeated exposure to mini-activities that produce an output and then require perspective mapping
- Each activity below produces a recordable output: a score, a reaction-time effect, a decision pattern, a plotted trend, or a saved values profile
- All links are free and student-facing

## Interactive teaching labs

## Lab: Biological perspective (mechanisms, brain, neurons)
- Link
  - https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/neuron/latest/neuron_en.html
- Activity type
  - Simulation with manipulable variables
- Output type
  - Screenshot of a firing pattern plus parameter settings
- Typical completion time
  - 10–15 minutes
- Submission evidence format
  - One screenshot
  - One variable-change note: “I changed X and saw Y”
- Instructor framing notes
  - Require a mechanism statement: “The biological perspective explains behavior via neural processes”

## Lab: Behavioral perspective (learning via conditioning)
- Link
  - https://educationalgames.nobelprize.org/educational/medicine/pavlov/pavlov.html
- Activity type
  - Interactive conditioning game
- Output type
  - Trial outcome pattern and a brief contingency description
- Typical completion time
  - 10–15 minutes
- Submission evidence format
  - Screenshot of outcome
  - One sentence identifying CS, US, CR, UR
- Instructor framing notes
  - Require “observable behavior only” phrasing for the behavioral lens

## Lab: Cognitive perspective (information processing limits)
- Link
  - https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/experiment_stroop.html
- Activity type
  - Reaction-time task
- Output type
  - Congruent vs incongruent performance difference
- Typical completion time
  - 5–10 minutes
- Submission evidence format
  - Screenshot of results
  - One numeric difference score if shown
- Instructor framing notes
  - Require a processing explanation: “Interference occurs because reading is automatic and competes with color naming”

## Lab: Psychodynamic bridge lab (automatic, not fully conscious processing)
- Link
  - https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html
- Activity type
  - Timed categorization task with feedback
- Output type
  - Completion evidence plus methods reflection
- Typical completion time
  - 10–20 minutes
- Submission evidence format
  - Screenshot of completion screen
  - One methods limitation sentence
- Instructor framing notes
  - Frame this as “automatic cognition” and “nonconscious processes,” not as a clinical or diagnostic interpretation

## Lab: Evolutionary perspective (strategic interaction, cooperation)
- Link
  - https://ncase.me/trust/
- Activity type
  - Interactive simulation of repeated games
- Output type
  - Strategy outcomes and a short explanation of what worked and why
- Typical completion time
  - 15–25 minutes
- Submission evidence format
  - One screenshot of an outcome
  - One strategy note: “Strategy A outperformed B when X changed”
- Instructor framing notes
  - Require an adaptation logic statement: “Which strategy survives across repeated interaction and why”

## Lab: Sociocultural perspective (context and systems)
- Link
  - https://www.gapminder.org/fw/world-health-chart/
- Activity type
  - Interactive dataset visualization
- Output type
  - Country comparison pattern over time
- Typical completion time
  - 10–20 minutes
- Submission evidence format
  - Screenshot of a comparison
  - One claim with a limitation: “This is group-level data”
- Instructor framing notes
  - Require an ecological fallacy warning and one context hypothesis

## Lab: Humanistic perspective (values, meaning, choice)
- Link
  - https://www.valuescardsort.com/
- Activity type
  - Drag-and-drop values sorting tool
- Output type
  - Saved or captured values profile
- Typical completion time
  - 10–20 minutes
- Submission evidence format
  - Screenshot or exported output
  - One sentence explaining why one value rose to the top in the scenario provided
- Instructor framing notes
  - Use a fictional scenario by default so students are not graded on personal disclosure

## Lab: Multi-perspective comparison lab (explicitly contrasts approaches)
- Link
  - https://www.learner.org/series/discovering-psychology/explorations/approaches-in-practice/
- Activity type
  - Interactive exploration comparing approaches
- Output type
  - Completed “approach match” response set
- Typical completion time
  - 15–25 minutes
- Submission evidence format
  - Screenshot of one segment
  - One “approach match” table: perspective, key assumption, best-fit evidence
- Instructor framing notes
  - Treat this as the capstone synthesis for Topic 2

## Teaching designs and ideas

## Option: 50-minute station rotation that forces perspective mapping
- Station 1: Pavlov game
- Station 2: Stroop
- Station 3: Neuron sim
- Station 4: Gapminder
- Wrap: Students complete a perspective match table

Grading artifact
- One screenshot per station
- One row per station in a perspective match table

## Option: Hypothesis-first mini-study inside Topic 2
- Pre-specify a question: “Which perspective best explains performance in this task and what would it predict if we changed X”
- Students run Stroop or Neuron
- Students submit:
  - the output
  - the prediction
  - the perspective justification

## Debrief prompts that keep this lab-like
- What is the dependent variable in the activity
- What mechanism does each perspective claim explains the output
- What would a different perspective treat as the key variable
- What is one limitation of interpreting the output through only one lens

## Teaching designs and ideas

## Option A: 50-minute “IV and DV bootcamp” lab day
- Run Stroop or Flanker
- Students submit:
  - IV statement
  - DV statement
  - one operational definition
  - one confound and one fix

Grading artifact
- One screenshot
- Four-item method response set

## Option B: Station rotation that produces a class dataset
- Station 1: PsyToolkit Stroop
- Station 2: PsyToolkit Digit Span
- Station 3: Hanover Mental Rotation with one parameter change
- Station 4: Understanding Science workflow artifact

Grading artifact
- One number per station plus one limitation per station

## Option C: Mini-study proposal inside Intro Psych constraints
- Provide a menu of feasible IVs
  - time pressure, distraction, stimulus complexity, practice
- Students choose one and write:
  - hypothesis
  - design type
  - operational definitions
  - planned analysis in plain language
  - one validity threat and mitigation

## Debrief prompts that keep this lab-like
- What is the independent variable and what are its levels
- What is the dependent variable and how is it quantified
- What is one alternative explanation that does not require your preferred theory
- What is one confound unique to online experiments and how would you mitigate it
- What conclusion is justified and what conclusion would be overreach

- Part 3: One interpretation paragraph with correct uncertainty language

Grading artifact
- Two screenshots
- One interval
- One interpretation paragraph

## Option: Station rotation for mixed skill levels
- Station 1: Guess the Correlation
- Station 2: Sampling distributions simulation
- Station 3: StatKey bootstrap interval
- Station 4: CODAP quick plot with a provided dataset

Grading artifact
- One screenshot per station
- One sentence per station identifying what the output represents

## Option: Asynchronous online lab that produces a reusable class dataset
- Students run one StatKey activity and submit one numeric result plus a screenshot
- Instructor aggregates results and uses them later for:
  - distribution shape
  - outliers
  - interval interpretation
  - difference between individual result and class-level pattern

## Debrief prompts that keep this lab-like
- What is the statistic and what is being treated as the sample
- What is the output and what does it represent, such as sampling distribution, null distribution, or bootstrap distribution
- What claim is justified and what claim would be overreach
- What would change if the sample were larger or if the measurement were noisier
- What confound or bias could distort your interpretation

## Safety and privacy defaults for this topic
- Grade completion and reasoning, not moral agreement
- Allow an opt-out option for any activity that feels personally activating
  - Provide an instructor screenshot set and have students analyze the decisions and consequences instead
- Avoid requiring students to disclose personal experiences with trauma, mental health, or illegal behavior

## Teaching designs and ideas

## Option: 50-minute lab day, research ethics focus
- Part 1: ORI scenario work in small groups
- Part 2: Informed consent critique using OHRP module
- Part 3: Submit a one-page ethics audit
  - risk, benefit, mitigation, consent, data integrity, authorship

## Option: Station rotation for mixed pacing
- Station 1: ORI The Lab
- Station 2: OpenLearn ethics challenge
- Station 3: Moral Machine
- Station 4: Consent critique mini-task

Grading artifact
- One screenshot per station
- One paragraph total that includes one IV, one DV, and one validity or ethics threat applied to research

## Option: Asynchronous online lab with standardized prompts
- Students complete one interactive activity
- Students submit:
  - screenshot
  - three short answers
    - what was the key decision
    - what principle or rule guided the decision
    - what information would you require before approving the study or action

## Debrief prompts that keep this lab-like
- What was the decision point and what were the available options
- What foreseeable consequences followed each option
- What ethical principle or rule did you prioritize and why
- What information was missing that would change the decision
- What mitigation would reduce harm while preserving the research question

## Selection rationale
- Neuroscience is most teachable when students manipulate a model, observe a change, and then write a mechanism statement
- The activities below produce recordable outputs suitable for grading at scale
  - screenshots of parameter settings and outcomes
  - labeled structure identifications
  - graph interpretations and causal-chain explanations bounded to the model
- All links are free and student-facing

## Interactive teaching labs

  - Require one sentence explaining why hierarchical labeling matters for scientific communication

## Optional lab: Whole nervous system 3D model exploration
- Link
  - https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/the-nervous-system-2e6be1399756494b9f185ce8c5900911

- Submission evidence format
  - screenshot
  - categorical output
- Instructor framing notes
  - Use only if your class can reliably access apps
  - Default alternative
    - BrainFacts 3D Brain

## Teaching designs and ideas

## Option: 50-minute mechanism-first lab day
- Part 1: PhET Neuron with one assigned manipulation
- Part 2: Membrane Channels with a before and after comparison
- Part 3: One short written mechanism chain
  - Variable, physiological change, observed output, one limitation

Grading artifact
- Two screenshots
- One mechanism chain paragraph

## Option: Station rotation for mixed pacing
- Station 1: PhET Neuron
- Station 2: Membrane Channels
- Station 3: BrainFacts 3D Brain scavenger hunt
- Station 4: HHMI neural activity module segment

Grading artifact
- One screenshot per station
- One IV and DV statement per station
- One limitation per station

## Option: Asynchronous online lab that feeds Topic 4 later
- Students run PhET Neuron and record a binary outcome
  - spike occurred or did not occur under a defined setting
- Students submit the setting and outcome
- Instructor aggregates and uses the dataset later for
  - proportions, variability, and design critique

## Debrief prompts that keep this lab-like
- What is the independent variable you manipulated or the condition that differed
- What is the dependent variable and how is it represented in the interface
- What mechanism explains the observed change, based on the model and only the model
- What is one alternative explanation, such as misunderstanding the control or device differences
- What conclusion would be overreach given the simplifications of the model

    - IV and DV
    - operational definition for the DV
    - one threat to validity and one mitigation

## Debrief prompts that keep this lab-like
- What was manipulated or what differed across trials
- What was measured and how was it operationalized
- How would a stricter or looser criterion change outcomes in SDT
- What sources of error are most likely in an online sensation lab
- What conclusion is justified and what conclusion would be overreach

- Typical completion time
  - 5–15 minutes per station
- Submission evidence format
  - screenshot

## Teaching designs and ideas

## Option: 50-minute lab day, “perception as inference”
- Part 1: One ISLE Chapter 5 activity on Gestalt organization
- Part 2: One ISLE Chapter 7 depth cue activity
- Part 3: Change blindness demo
- Wrap: One synthesis paragraph
  - “What does this tell us about perception being constructive rather than a camera”

Grading artifact
- Three screenshots
- One synthesis paragraph with two perception terms used correctly

## Option: Station rotation for mixed pacing
- Station 1: ISLE Chapter 5 (organization)
- Station 2: ISLE Chapter 7 (depth)
- Station 3: ISLE Chapter 8 (motion)
- Station 4: ISLE Chapter 12 (speech perception)
- Station 5: Change blindness

Grading artifact
- One screenshot per station
- One IV and DV statement per station
- One mechanism statement per station

## Option: Asynchronous online lab with standardized prompts
- Students complete:
  - one ISLE organization activity
  - one depth activity
  - one change blindness demo
- Students submit:
  - screenshots
  - three short answers
    - prediction
    - observation
    - mechanism explanation

## Debrief prompts that keep this lab-like
- What did you manipulate or what differed across conditions
- What did you perceive and how did it differ from the physical stimulus
- What inference is the perceptual system making in this situation
- What boundary condition changes the effect, such as fixation, distance, or context cues
- What conclusion is justified and what conclusion would be overreach

- These activities produce recordable outputs suitable for grading at scale
  - reaction time, lapses, and errors over time
  - chronotype and sleep-quality scores
  - sleep diary field data across days
- All links are free and student-facing

- Part 2: SART
- Part 3: One short debrief comparing tasks
  - what each task measures and what each task confounds
- Wrap: one paragraph
  - IV, DV, and one validity threat for each task

Grading artifact
- Two screenshots
- Two numeric outputs
- One comparison paragraph

## Option: Station rotation for mixed pacing
- Station 1: PVT-B
- Station 2: SART
- Station 3: Chronotype (CIRENS)
- Station 4: Jet Lag Rooster (fictional scenario)
- Station 5: Sleep quality scale (vignette mode)

Grading artifact
- One screenshot per station
- One IV and DV statement per station
- One limitation per station

## Option: Asynchronous lab that generates a class dataset for Topic 4 later
- Students complete:
  - CIRENS score
  - one vigilance task metric (PVT-B mean RT or lapse count)
  - one week of diary-derived sleep duration estimate
- Instructor aggregates and uses later to discuss:
  - correlations, variability, and why causal inference is not justified

## Debrief prompts that keep this lab-like
- What is the independent variable or condition difference you are treating as meaningful
- What is the dependent variable and how is it operationalized
- What is one confound that is especially likely in online sleep and attention labs
- What claim is justified and what claim would be overreach
- What additional data would you need to make a stronger inference

## Selection rationale
- Learning is most teachable when students can observe behavior change across trials, then explain it using specific learning terms
- These activities produce recordable outputs suitable for grading at scale
  - trial outcomes and visible behavior change

## Safety and privacy defaults for this topic
- Grade completion and concept reasoning, not performance level
- Avoid requiring students to disclose personal behavior change goals
- Use fictional scenarios when asking for examples

## Teaching designs and ideas

## Option: 50-minute “learning mechanisms” lab day
- Part 1: Pavlov game
- Part 2: Rescorla–Wagner parameter change
- Part 3: One operant H5P activity
- Wrap: one-page learning audit
  - learning type, IV, DV, operational definition, predicted change, one limitation

Grading artifact
- Three screenshots
- One short audit page

## Option: Station rotation for mixed pacing
- Station 1: Classical conditioning H5P
- Station 2: Operant conditioning H5P
- Station 3: Schedules H5P
- Station 4: Pavlov game
- Station 5: Rescorla–Wagner simulation

Grading artifact
- One screenshot per station
- One label plus one justification sentence per station

## Option: Hypothesis-first mini-study inside Topic 10
- Pre-specify
  - “Changing salience will change acquisition speed in the Rescorla–Wagner model”
- Students run two conditions
  - one baseline, one salience change
- Students submit
  - two screenshots and one comparison sentence

## Debrief prompts that keep this lab-like
- What is the independent variable in this activity
- What is the dependent variable and how is it operationalized
- What pattern across trials counts as evidence of learning
- What alternative explanation could produce the same pattern
- What conclusion is justified and what conclusion would be overreach

## Selection rationale
- Memory is naturally lab-driven because performance is observable and quantifiable
- These activities produce recordable outputs suitable for grading at scale
  - maximum span, accuracy, reaction time summaries, serial position patterns, false memory indicators
- All links are free and student-facing

## Core lab hubs you can reuse all semester

- PsyToolkit Experiment Library
  - https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/
  - Best for classic cognitive tasks with in-browser results screens

- Hanover Cognition Laboratory Experiments (HTML5/JS hub)
  - https://psych.hanover.edu/javatest/cle/Cognition_js/cognition.html
  - Best when you want “lab day” structure, parameter manipulation, and repeatable demonstrations

- TestMyBrain Memory Games (M2C2 battery)
  - https://studies.testmybrain.org/m2c2/?study=m2c2
  - Best as a quick participation-based battery with a clear end state for submission

## Interactive teaching labs

## Lab: Working memory span (verbal and visuospatial)
- PsyToolkit Digit Span (run)
  - https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/experiment_digitspan.html
- PsyToolkit Reverse Digit Span (run)
  - https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/experiment_rdigitspan.html
- PsyToolkit Corsi Block-Tapping (run)
  - https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/experiment_corsi.html
- PsyToolkit Backward Corsi (run)
  - https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/experiment_backward_corsi.html

Output you can grade
- Maximum span (one number) and one screenshot of the results screen

Instructor framing notes
- Require a distinction between the construct and the measure
  - “Span score is a performance measure that approximates working memory capacity under specific task demands”
- Require one likely confound in online testing
  - distraction, misunderstanding instructions, device differences

## Lab: Updating and working memory load (N-back)
- PsyToolkit 2-Back (run)
  - https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/experiment_nback2.html
- PsyToolkit 2-Back touchscreen version (run)
  - https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/touch_nback2.html

Output you can grade
- Accuracy or score summary (if shown) plus a screenshot

Instructor framing notes
- Require a prediction before running
  - “Performance should drop if the task is harder or if attention is divided”
- Require a speed–accuracy note
  - why faster responding can increase errors

## Lab: Complex span and dual-task demands (operation span)
- PsyToolkit Automated Operation Span (run)
  - https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/experiment_aospan.html

Output you can grade
- Final score plus a screenshot

Instructor framing notes
- Require a plain-language description of the two tasks happening at once
- Require a claim about why dual-tasking stresses working memory

## Lab: Interference and short-term memory loss (Brown–Peterson style)
- Hanover Brown–Peterson interference lab
  - https://psych.hanover.edu/javatest/cle/Cognition_js/exp/BrownPeterson.html

Output you can grade
- One screenshot of results plus one sentence identifying the interference mechanism

Instructor framing notes
- Require a distinction between decay and interference as explanations
- Require a limitation statement
  - uncontrolled environment, practice effects, and device variability

## Lab: Serial position (primacy and recency) as a class dataset
- Hanover Serial Position lab
  - https://psych.hanover.edu/javatest/cle/Cognition_js/exp/SerialPosition.html

Output you can grade
- One screenshot of the serial position pattern
- Two derived values
  - average recall for early items and late items (students can estimate or compute if the tool displays counts)

Instructor framing notes
- Require an interpretation that links primacy and recency to memory processes
- Require an “analysis caution” note
  - distribution shape and ceiling effects can distort simple averages

## Lab: False memory (DRM paradigm demonstration)
- Hanover DRM False Memory lab
  - https://psych.hanover.edu/javatest/cle/Cognition_js/exp/DRMfalseMemory.html

Output you can grade
- One screenshot plus one “false memory indicator” statement
  - for example, whether the critical lure was endorsed

Instructor framing notes
- Require careful phrasing
  - this demonstrates normal memory reconstruction under specific conditions
- Require an ethics note
  - why this should not be used to judge credibility in real-life settings

## Optional lab: Quick battery participation (TestMyBrain)
- TestMyBrain Memory Games (M2C2)
  - https://studies.testmybrain.org/m2c2/?study=m2c2

Output you can grade
- Completion evidence screenshot plus one short reflection about task difficulty and measurement noise

Instructor framing notes
- Grade completion and methodological reflection only
- Do not treat results as diagnostic or stable traits

## Safety and privacy defaults for this topic
- Grade completion, interpretation, and methods reasoning, not performance level
- Allow an opt-out alternative
  - analyze an instructor-provided screenshot of results and answer the same prompts

## Teaching designs and ideas

## Option: 50-minute lab day, “how memory fails”
- Part 1: Digit Span or Corsi (working memory)
- Part 2: Brown–Peterson (interference)
- Part 3: DRM false memory (reconstruction)
- Wrap: one-page methods note
  - what was measured, what could bias it, and what claim is justified

Grading artifact
- Three screenshots
- One paragraph explaining the three different failure mechanisms

## Option: Station rotation that produces a reusable class dataset
- Station 1: Digit Span
- Station 2: N-back
- Station 3: Serial Position
- Station 4: DRM False Memory

Grading artifact
- One screenshot per station
- One numeric output per station
- One limitation statement per station

## Debrief prompts that keep this lab-like
- What was measured and how was it operationalized
- What pattern counts as evidence of a memory effect, not just random variation
- What alternative explanation could produce the same pattern
- What online-lab confound is most plausible and how would you mitigate it
- What conclusion is justified and what conclusion would be overreach

---

## Selection rationale
- Cognition is highly teachable through lab tasks because core constructs appear as measurable performance patterns
- These activities produce recordable outputs suitable for grading at scale
  - reaction time and accuracy
  - condition differences such as congruent versus incongruent
  - switching costs and time-on-task decline
  - decision patterns that reveal reasoning traps
- All links are free and student-facing

## Core lab hubs you can reuse all semester
- PsyToolkit Experiment Library
  - https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/
- Hanover Cognition Laboratory Experiments (HTML5/JS hub)
  - https://psych.hanover.edu/javatest/cle/Cognition_js/cognition.html

## Interactive teaching labs

## Lab: Selective attention and interference (Stroop)
- PsyToolkit Stroop (run)
  - https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/experiment_stroop.html
- Hanover Stroop (HTML5/JS)
  - https://psych.hanover.edu/javatest/cle/Cognition_js/exp/stroop.html

Output you can grade
- Screenshot of results
- One difference score if available, such as incongruent minus congruent

Instructor framing notes
- Require a processing explanation referencing automaticity and interference
- Require a speed–accuracy caution statement

## Lab: Executive attention and distractor interference (Flanker)
- PsyToolkit Flanker (run)
  - https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/experiment_flanker.html
- PsyToolkit Flanker arrows (alternative)
  - https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/flanker_arrows.html

Output you can grade
- Screenshot plus one condition difference statement
- One limitation statement about distractions and device latency

Instructor framing notes
- Require a clear identification of the congruent and incongruent conditions

## Lab: Cognitive flexibility (task switching and multitasking)
- PsyToolkit Task Switching (run)
  - https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/experiment_taskswitching.html
- PsyToolkit Multitasking (run)
  - https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/experiment_multitasking.html

Output you can grade
- Screenshot of results
- One qualitative report of switch cost or multitask cost

Instructor framing notes
- Require an operational definition of switching cost
  - performance difference between switch and repeat trials

## Lab: Response inhibition (Go/No-go and Stop Signal)
- PsyToolkit Go/No-go (run)
  - https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/experiment_go-no-go.html
- PsyToolkit Stop Signal (run)
  - https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/experiment_stopsignal.html

Output you can grade
- Screenshot plus one error metric
  - commission errors or stop failures

Instructor framing notes
- Require a “what counts as an error” statement
- Require one design improvement suggestion to reduce confounds

## Lab: Temporal attention bottleneck (attentional blink)
- PsyToolkit Attentional Blink (run)
  - https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/experiment_ab.html
- Hanover Attentional Blink (HTML5/JS)
  - https://psych.hanover.edu/javatest/cle/Cognition_js/exp/attnBlink.html

Output you can grade
- Screenshot plus one sentence describing the bottleneck effect

Instructor framing notes
- Require a prediction before running and a report after running

## Lab: Divided attention and cognitive load (dual task)
- Hanover Dual Task (HTML5/JS)
  - https://psych.hanover.edu/javatest/cle/Cognition_js/exp/dualTask.html

Output you can grade
- Screenshot plus one statement comparing single-task and dual-task performance

Instructor framing notes
- Require an explanation of limited-capacity processing

## Lab: Visual search (set size effects)
- PsyToolkit Visual Search (run)
  - https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/experiment_search.html

Output you can grade
- Screenshot plus a “search slope” interpretation statement
  - how performance changes when more items are added

Instructor framing notes
- Require a prediction: parallel search versus serial search under different conditions

## Lab: Reasoning trap (Wason selection task)
- Philosophy Experiments Wason series
  - Q1: https://www.philosophyexperiments.com/wason/Default.aspx
  - Q2: https://www.philosophyexperiments.com/wason/Default2.aspx
  - Q3: https://www.philosophyexperiments.com/wason/Default3.aspx

Output you can grade
- Selected cards plus one explanation of why that selection tests the rule

Instructor framing notes
- Require explicit statement of falsification logic, not confirmation logic

## Lab: Decision making under uncertainty (Monty Hall)
- Interactive simulator
  - https://montyhall.io/

Output you can grade
- A brief record of results across at least 10 trials
  - stay versus switch win rates

Instructor framing notes
- Require a probability explanation and one reason intuition fails here

## Safety and privacy defaults for this topic
- Grade completion and reasoning, not performance level
- Require a limitation statement for every task
- Offer an opt-out path
  - analyze an instructor-provided screenshot and answer the same IV/DV prompts

## Teaching designs and ideas

## Option: 50-minute “where cognition breaks” lab day
- Part 1: Stroop or Flanker
- Part 2: Task Switching
- Part 3: Monty Hall
- Wrap: one-page synthesis
  - which tasks reflect interference, which reflect capacity limits, which reflect probabilistic reasoning

Grading artifact
- Three screenshots
- One synthesis paragraph with three cognition terms used correctly

## Option: Station rotation for mixed pacing
- Station 1: Stroop
- Station 2: Go/No-go
- Station 3: Attentional blink
- Station 4: Visual search
- Station 5: Wason or Monty Hall

Grading artifact
- One screenshot per station
- One IV and DV sentence per station
- One limitation per station

## Debrief prompts that keep this lab-like
- What is the independent variable or condition difference
- What is the dependent variable and how is it quantified
- What pattern counts as evidence of the cognitive construct
- What confound is most likely in online testing and how would you mitigate it
- What conclusion is justified and what conclusion would be overreach

notes: "Pack includes Topic 4 Statistics and Topic 5 Ethics. Both are constrained to free, student-facing interactive teaching labs with debriefable outputs and grading-friendly artifacts."
---

## Topic 4: Statistics

## Selection rationale
- Statistics is best learned by simulation and interactive visualization rather than formula-first instruction
- Each activity produces recordable outputs suitable for grading at scale
  - screenshot of a graph or distribution
  - one numeric result such as confidence interval endpoints or p-value estimate
  - one plain-language interpretation with a limitation
- All links are free and student-facing

## Interactive teaching labs
- StatKey bootstrap confidence intervals
  - https://www.lock5stat.com/StatKey/
  - https://www.lock5stat.com/StatKey/bootstrap_1_quant/bootstrap_1_quant.html
- StatKey randomization test for a difference
  - https://www.lock5stat.com/StatKey/randomization_1_quant_1_cat/randomization_1_quant_1_cat.html
- OnlineStatBook sampling distributions simulation
  - https://onlinestatbook.com/stat_sim/sampling_dist/
  - https://onlinestatbook.com/stat_sim/samp_dist_js/index.html
- Rossman/Chance Guess the Correlation
  - https://www.rossmanchance.com/applets/GuessCorrelation.html
- CODAP data analysis environment
  - https://codap.concord.org/
  - https://codap.concord.org/get-started/
- Tuva Tools tutorials and tools
  - https://tuvalabs.com/tools/
  - https://tuvalabs.com/tutorials/
- Gapminder World Health Chart
  - https://www.gapminder.org/fw/world-health-chart/
- Optional: Seeing Theory interactive concept visuals
  - https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/

## Teaching designs and ideas
- 50-minute inference lab day
  - Sampling distributions, then StatKey bootstrap interval, then interpretation paragraph
- Station rotation
  - Guess correlation, sampling distributions, StatKey, CODAP
- Asynchronous dataset builder
  - Students submit one StatKey numeric result plus screenshot; instructor aggregates for distribution discussion

## Debrief prompts
- What is the statistic and what is being treated as the sample
- What does the output represent
- What claim is justified and what claim would be overreach
- What would change with larger sample or noisier measurement
- What confound or bias could distort interpretation

---

## Topic 5: Ethics

## Selection rationale
- Ethics is most teachable through decision points and consequence tracing rather than lecture-only coverage
- Each activity produces recordable outputs suitable for grading at scale
  - decision path and outcome
  - completion evidence and a methods reflection
  - quiz completion where available
- All links are free and student-facing

## Interactive teaching labs
- ORI The Lab
  - https://ori.hhs.gov/the-lab
- ORI Research Clinic
  - https://ori.hhs.gov/research-clinic
- OHRP Participant-Centered Informed Consent Training
  - https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/education-and-outreach/human-research-protection-training/participant-centered-informed-consent-training/index.html
- OpenLearn ethics committee challenge
  - https://www.open.edu/openlearn/society-politics-law/why-do-we-need-research-ethics
- MIT Moral Machine
  - https://moralmachine.mit.edu/
- UPenn MEHP ethics of research with human subjects module
  - https://improvinghealthcare.mehp.upenn.edu/course/ethics-research-human-subjects
- Optional: Quandary ethics game
  - https://quandarygame.org/play

## Teaching designs and ideas
- 50-minute research ethics lab day
  - ORI scenario plus consent critique plus one-page ethics audit
- Station rotation
  - ORI, OpenLearn, Moral Machine, consent critique
- Asynchronous standardized prompts
  - One activity plus screenshot plus three short answers: decision, principle, missing info

## Debrief prompts
- What was the decision point and available options
- What foreseeable consequences followed each option
- What ethical principle or rule did you prioritize and why
- What information was missing that would change the decision
- What mitigation would reduce harm while preserving the research question

notes: "Pack includes Topic 7 Sensation and Topic 8 Perception. Both emphasize lab-style interactivity (measurement, manipulation, and debriefable outputs). Grade operational definitions, predictions, and limitations rather than performance level."
---

## Topic 7: Sensation

## Selection rationale
- Sensation is measurement-first, so the best teaching labs are psychophysics and signal detection tasks with recordable outputs.
- Outputs are grading-friendly: threshold estimates, SDT outcomes, ROC shifts, and parameter-change screenshots.

## Core interactive labs (free)
- ISLE Chapter 2 psychophysics hub (thresholds, JND, SDT, ROC)
  - https://isle.hanover.edu/Chapter02.html
  - https://isle.hanover.edu/isle2/index.html?ch=Chapter02
- PhET Color Vision (stimulus parameter manipulation)
  - https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulations/color-vision
  - https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/color-vision/latest/color-vision_en.html
- PhET Sound Waves (frequency and amplitude manipulation)
  - https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulations/sound-waves
  - https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/sound-waves/latest/sound-waves_all.html
- UNSW online hearing sensitivity demonstration (calibration-limited; requires strong disclaimer)
  - https://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/hearing.html

## Teaching design ideas
- 50-minute lab day
  - One ISLE threshold method activity
  - One ISLE SDT or ROC activity
  - One PhET activity (color or sound)
  - Submit IV, DV, DV operational definition, one confound, one mitigation
- Station rotation
  - ISLE threshold, ISLE SDT, PhET color, PhET sound, optional UNSW hearing curve
- Submission pattern (scales well)
  - One screenshot plus one numeric estimate plus one limitation statement per station

## Debrief prompts
- What was manipulated or what differed across trials?
- What was measured and how was it operationalized?
- How would a stricter or looser criterion change SDT outcomes?
- What online-lab confound is most plausible here?
- What conclusion is justified and what is overreach?

---

## Topic 8: Perception

## Selection rationale
- Perception labs are strongest when students make predictions, experience a perceptual outcome, and explain it as inference under constraints.
- Outputs are grading-friendly: screenshots, labeled phenomena, prediction-versus-observation notes, and boundary-condition statements.

## Core interactive labs (free)
- ISLE Chapter 5 (Gestalt, figure-ground, illusory contours, bistable perception)
  - https://isle.hanover.edu/Chapter05.html
  - https://isle.hanover.edu/isle2/index.html?ch=Chapter05
- ISLE Chapter 7 (depth cues and constancies)
  - https://isle.hanover.edu/Chapter07.html
- ISLE Chapter 8 (motion perception and aftereffects)
  - https://isle.hanover.edu/Chapter08.html
- ISLE Chapter 12 (speech perception: McGurk, phonemic restoration, VOT)
  - https://isle.hanover.edu/Chapter12.html
- Change blindness flicker demonstration
  - https://sites.socsci.uci.edu/~ddhoff/cb.html
- Michael Bach interactive phenomena library (assign specific stations)
  - https://michaelbach.de/ot/
  - https://michaelbach.de/ot/mot-adapt/
  - https://michaelbach.de/ot/mot-mib/

## Teaching design ideas
- 50-minute lab day: perception as inference
  - One ISLE Chapter 5 activity
  - One ISLE Chapter 7 activity
  - Change blindness demo
  - Submit a synthesis paragraph using two perception terms correctly
- Station rotation
  - ISLE 5, ISLE 7, ISLE 8, ISLE 12, change blindness (Bach stations optional)
- Submission pattern (scales well)
  - One screenshot per station
  - One prediction and one observation
  - One mechanism statement and one boundary-condition note

## Debrief prompts
- What did you perceive and how did it differ from the physical stimulus?
- What inference is the perceptual system making?
- What boundary condition changes the effect (fixation, distance, context cues)?
- What confound is most plausible in online perception demos?
- What conclusion is justified and what is overreach?
