# Week 4 Exam 1 Review Companion

## What this is

This is an instructor-facing review companion for Exam 1.

It is designed to support:

- review-day structure for Meeting 7 and Meeting 8
- high-yield misconception correction
- low-prep retrieval practice blocks
- review item drafting that aligns to Topics 1 through 9

## Review scope

Exam 1 covers Units 1 and 2, Topics 1 through 9.

- Unit 1 topics
  - 1 History
  - 2 Theoretical Perspectives
  - 3 Research Methods
  - 4 Statistics
  - 5 Ethics
- Unit 2 topics
  - 6 Neuroscience
  - 7 Sensation
  - 8 Perception
  - 9 Consciousness

## Review-day intent

Students leave the review sessions able to:

- state core definitions accurately
- explain method limits, especially correlation versus causation
- use the key distinctions correctly
  - sensation versus perception
  - bottom-up versus top-down
  - random sampling versus random assignment
- avoid common novice misconceptions

---

# Meeting 7 run-of-show
Review session 1

## Goal

Sweep Topics 1 through 5 and build a bridge into Topics 6 through 9.

## Structure

### Block 1
Definition and perspective retrieval

- Prompt
  - Psychology definition
  - What a theoretical perspective is
- Common misconception targets
  - psychology equals therapy
  - perspective equals one proven answer

### Block 2
Methods ladder and inference limits

- Prompt
  - case study, observation, survey, correlation, experiment
  - what each can conclude
- Common misconception targets
  - correlation proves causation
  - any two-group comparison is an experiment
  - random sampling and random assignment are interchangeable

### Block 3
Ethics and statistics as reasoning tools

- Prompt
  - why ethics exists in human subjects research
  - informed consent purpose
  - representativeness and sampling bias as concepts
- Common misconception targets
  - ethics is paperwork
  - larger sample automatically fixes biased sampling

---

# Meeting 8 run-of-show
Review session 2

## Goal

Sweep Topics 6 through 9 and reinforce the big distinctions.

## Structure

### Block 1
Neuroscience signal story

- Prompt
  - neuron communication in two to three sentences
  - synapse and neurotransmitter as basic mechanisms
- Common misconception targets
  - neurons are only electrical wires
  - neurotransmitters are emotions
  - one brain region equals one behavior

### Block 2
Sensation and perception pipeline

- Prompt
  - sensation versus perception
  - transduction
  - thresholds
  - adaptation
- Common misconception targets
  - thresholds are fixed and identical
  - adaptation means stimulus disappeared

### Block 3
Perception and consciousness sweep

- Prompt
  - bottom-up versus top-down
  - illusions as evidence
  - consciousness and attention limits
  - circadian rhythm, sleep stages, REM versus NREM
- Common misconception targets
  - top-down equals making things up
  - sleep is passive
  - dreaming has one proven purpose

# High-yield misconception list for Exam 1

Use these as distractor sources and as explicit correction moments.

- Correlation proves causation
- Random sampling equals random assignment
- Observation reveals causes automatically
- Bigger sample fixes sampling bias automatically
- Ethics equals informed consent only
- Neurons communicate only by electricity
- Neurotransmitters map one-to-one to emotions
- Sensation equals perception
- Top-down processing equals making things up
- Illusions mean senses failed
- Sleep is a blank shutdown
- Dreaming has one proven purpose
