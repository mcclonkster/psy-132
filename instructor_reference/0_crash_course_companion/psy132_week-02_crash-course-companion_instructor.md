## Student accountability for Week 2 and Quiz Q02

Students are responsible for the following.

- Basic neuron structure and communication vocabulary
- Synapses and neurotransmitters as the basic communication mechanism
- Central nervous system and peripheral nervous system distinction
- Major brain structures introduced and broad function connections
- The idea that behavior and mental processes arise from biological systems operating in context

Students are not responsible for memorizing detailed brain anatomy beyond the listed key terms unless explicitly assigned.

## Instructor intent

- Students leave Topic 6 able to narrate a basic signal story
  - input and output are linked by communication systems
- Students can avoid the common traps
  - neurotransmitters as magic
  - one brain region equals one behavior
  - neuroscience equals reductionism

## Misconceptions to surface and correct

- Neurons communicate only by electricity
- Neurotransmitters are the same thing as neurons
- One brain region causes one behavior in a simple one-to-one way
- If a brain region is active, it proves that region is the sole cause
- Biological explanation means psychological explanation is unnecessary

- neuron
- dendrite
- axon
- myelin
- synapse
- neurotransmitter
- excitatory
- inhibitory
- central nervous system
- peripheral nervous system
- spinal cord
- brainstem
- cerebellum
- thalamus
- limbic system
- amygdala
- hippocampus
- cerebral cortex
- frontal lobe
- parietal lobe
- temporal lobe
- occipital lobe

## Segment guide with integrated instructor notes

### Segment A: The neuron as the basic unit

- Student main ideas
  - Neurons communicate using electrical and chemical signals
  - Neuron parts support receiving and sending signals
- Student write-down line
  - Neurons are cells that communicate information by sending signals to other neurons.
- Instructor talk move
  - Draw a simple neuron and label dendrites and axon, then ask what each does
- Instructor discussion prompt
  - Why does a communication system need both receiving and sending structures
- Instructor misconception correction
  - Neurons do not just conduct electricity like wires; they use multiple mechanisms

### Segment B: Synapses and neurotransmitters

- Student main ideas
  - Neurons communicate at synapses
  - Neurotransmitters influence whether signals continue
- Student write-down line
  - A synapse is a junction where neurons communicate, often using neurotransmitters.
- Instructor talk move
  - Use a yes and no framing for excitatory and inhibitory, without over-detail
- Instructor discussion prompt
  - Why might a system benefit from both excitation and inhibition
- Instructor misconception correction
  - Neurotransmitters are not emotions; they are chemical messengers with effects that depend on context

### Segment C: Big-picture nervous system organization

- Student main ideas
  - Central nervous system is brain and spinal cord
  - Peripheral nervous system connects body and central nervous system
- Student write-down line
  - The central nervous system is brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system connects the rest of the body to it.
- Instructor talk move
  - Give a simple pathway example such as touching a hot surface and pulling away
- Instructor discussion prompt
  - Which parts are detecting, transmitting, and responding
- Instructor misconception correction
  - The nervous system is a network; location matters, but so do connections

### Segment D: Brain structures and broad functions

- Student main ideas
  - Older and newer structures contribute different roles
  - Networks matter more than one-to-one mapping
- Student write-down line
  - Different brain regions contribute to different functions, and behavior emerges from networks working together.
- Instructor talk move
  - Choose four structures and connect each to one broad function without overpromising precision
- Instructor discussion prompt
  - What would count as good evidence for linking a structure to a function
- Instructor misconception correction
  - Localization is real, but it is rarely simple

### Segment E: Connecting brain and behavior

- Student main ideas
  - Brain systems support what people do and experience
  - Neuroscience supports psychological explanation rather than replacing it
- Student write-down line
  - Biological explanations and psychological explanations can be different levels of the same system.
- Instructor talk move
  - Ask students to give a psychological explanation and then ask what a biological level might add
- Instructor discussion prompt
  - What changes when you change the level of explanation
- Instructor misconception correction
  - Reductionism is not required; levels can be complementary

## Quick check for Topic 6

- Students answer in two to three sentences
  - How does a neuron communicate with another neuron
- Students answer in one sentence each
  - central nervous system
  - peripheral nervous system
- Students list three brain structures and give a broad function for each

# Topic 7 companion
Sensation

## Video for Topic 7

- Crash Course Psychology #5 Sensation and Perception

## Student accountability for Week 2 and Quiz Q02

Students are responsible for the following.

- Sensation versus perception distinction
- Transduction
- Threshold terms and application
  - absolute threshold
  - difference threshold
  - signal detection theory as a basic idea
- Sensory adaptation and an example

Students are not responsible for detailed vision system anatomy beyond what is needed to support transduction, unless explicitly assigned.

## Instructor intent

- Students leave Topic 7 able to describe the input side of the system
  - physical energy to neural signal
- Students can apply threshold ideas to everyday examples
- Students can separate detection from interpretation

## Misconceptions to surface and correct

- Sensation and perception are the same thing
- Thresholds are fixed and identical across people and contexts
- If you miss a stimulus, it proves your senses failed
- Sensory adaptation means the stimulus is gone rather than your response changing

## Key terms

- sensation
- perception
- sensory receptor
- transduction
- bottom-up processing
- top-down processing
- absolute threshold
- difference threshold
- just noticeable difference
- signal detection theory
- sensory adaptation

## Segment guide with integrated instructor notes

### Segment A: Sensation and perception

- Student main ideas
  - Sensation detects and relays physical energy
  - Perception organizes and interprets the sensory signals
- Student write-down line
  - Sensation detects input, and perception interprets what the input means.
- Instructor talk move
  - Use a simple ambiguous stimulus example and ask what part is sensation and what part is perception
- Instructor discussion prompt
  - What can change in perception even if sensation stays the same
- Instructor misconception correction
  - The same stimulus can be perceived differently depending on context and expectations

### Segment B: Transduction

- Student main ideas
  - Sensory receptors respond to specific types of energy
  - Transduction converts energy into neural signals
- Student write-down line
  - Transduction converts physical energy into neural signals.
- Instructor talk move
  - Use one modality example such as light to neural signals in vision
- Instructor discussion prompt
  - Why does the brain need conversion rather than using energy directly
- Instructor misconception correction
  - The brain does not receive light or sound; it receives neural patterns

### Segment C: Thresholds and detection

- Student main ideas
  - Absolute threshold is minimum intensity needed to detect something part of the time
  - Difference threshold is minimum difference needed to notice change
  - Signal detection theory depends on both sensory sensitivity and decision factors
- Student write-down line
  - Thresholds describe the minimum intensity needed to detect a stimulus or detect a change.
- Instructor talk move
  - Provide one concrete example for each threshold type
- Instructor discussion prompt
  - Why would the same person detect the same stimulus in one context but not another
- Instructor misconception correction
  - Detection is influenced by attention, motivation, fatigue, and expectations

### Segment D: Sensory adaptation

- Student main ideas
  - Responsiveness decreases with constant stimulation
  - Adaptation supports change detection
- Student write-down line
  - Sensory adaptation is reduced sensitivity to constant stimulation.
- Instructor talk move
  - Ask for everyday adaptation examples such as smell or clothing pressure
- Instructor discussion prompt
  - What would happen if adaptation did not occur
- Instructor misconception correction
  - Adaptation changes response, not the physical stimulus

## Quick check for Topic 7

- Students answer in one sentence each
  - sensation
  - perception
  - transduction
- Students answer in two sentences
  - difference between absolute threshold and difference threshold
- Students give one example
  - sensory adaptation and why it is useful
