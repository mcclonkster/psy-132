# Video 1 companion
Crash Course Psychology #1: Intro to Psychology

## Learning targets

- Define psychology as used in this course and in the video
- Distinguish psychology as a science from opinion, anecdote, and self-help claims
- Identify major early perspectives and state what each prioritized
- Explain why multiple perspectives can coexist without reducing the field to anything goes

## Key terms

- psychology
- behavior
- mental processes
- scientific psychology
- structuralism
- introspection
- functionalism
- adaptation
- psychoanalysis
- unconscious processes
- behaviorism
- cognitive psychology
- neuroscience

## Segment guide

### Segment A: What psychology is

- Main ideas
  - Psychology studies behavior and mental processes
  - Psychology aims to understand and predict behavior using evidence-based approaches
- What to write down
  - Psychology is the scientific study of behavior and mental processes.

### Segment B: Why psychology is a science

- Main ideas
  - Personal experience can feel convincing while still being misleading
  - Scientific approaches reduce error by using systematic observation and testing
- What to write down
  - Science uses systematic methods to build and test explanations and reduce bias and error.

### Segment C: Early perspectives and what they prioritized

#### Structuralism

- Main ideas
  - Structuralism aimed to identify the elements of conscious experience
  - Introspection was used to report experience in a structured way
  - Limits include subjectivity and inconsistent reporting across people
- What to write down
  - Structuralism focused on the components of conscious experience, often using introspection.

#### Functionalism

- Main ideas
  - Functionalism focused on what mental processes and behavior do
  - Emphasis on function and adaptation in context
- What to write down
  - Functionalism focused on the function of behavior and mental processes.

#### Psychoanalysis

- Main ideas
  - Psychoanalysis emphasized unconscious influences and internal conflict
  - Historically influential and also debated
- What to write down
  - Psychoanalysis emphasizes unconscious processes that can influence thoughts and behavior.

#### Behaviorism

- Main ideas
  - Behaviorism emphasized observable behavior and measurable environmental influences
  - Emphasis on measurement and testing
- What to write down
  - Behaviorism focuses on observable behavior and how it is shaped by learning and environment.

### Segment D: Integration and modern psychology

- Main ideas
  - Psychology includes multiple perspectives because human behavior is complex
  - Different perspectives use different tools and answer different questions
- What to write down
  - Different perspectives answer different questions and use different tools.

## Common confusions to avoid

- Confusion
  - Psychology is only therapy
  - Psychology is only common sense
- Confusion
  - A perspective is a single proven answer
- Confusion
  - Behaviorism focuses on behavior because thoughts and feelings do not matter
- Confusion
  - Unconscious processes are supernatural or mystical

## Quick check for Video 1

- Choose one perspective and answer both
  - What does it focus on
  - What does it tend to ignore or downplay

# Video 2 companion
Crash Course Psychology #2: Psychological Research

## Learning targets

- Explain why intuition and anecdote are unreliable sources of knowledge
- Define theory, hypothesis, and operational definition
- Distinguish case study, naturalistic observation, survey methods, correlation, and experimentation
- Explain why correlation does not establish causation using directionality and third-variable logic
- Identify independent variable, dependent variable, control group, and random assignment
- Explain why replication increases confidence in results

## Key terms

- hindsight bias
- overconfidence
- theory
- hypothesis
- operational definition
- case study
- naturalistic observation
- survey
- interview
- random sampling
- correlation
- causation
- third variable
- experiment
- independent variable
- dependent variable
- random assignment
- control group
- placebo
- replication
- informed consent

## Segment guide

### Segment A: Why research methods matter

- Main ideas
  - Humans show predictable thinking errors
  - Research methods are designed to reduce those errors
- What to write down
  - Scientific methods help reduce bias and error in how we interpret experience.

### Segment B: Scientific method basics in psychology

- Main ideas
  - Theories organize observations and help explain patterns
  - Hypotheses are testable predictions derived from theories
  - Operational definitions specify how variables are measured or manipulated
  - Replication increases confidence in findings
- What to write down
  - A hypothesis is a testable prediction.
  - An operational definition tells how a concept is measured.

### Segment C: Descriptive methods

#### Case studies

- Main ideas
  - Case studies provide deep detail about one case
  - They can generate hypotheses and illustrate phenomena
  - They rarely justify broad generalization on their own
- What to write down
  - Case studies are rich in detail but limited for generalizing to a population.

#### Naturalistic observation

- Main ideas
  - Naturalistic observation describes behavior in real settings without manipulation
  - It can reveal patterns and contexts of behavior
  - It cannot establish cause and effect by itself
- What to write down
  - Naturalistic observation can describe behavior and patterns, but it cannot establish causation.

### Segment D: Self-report methods

- Main ideas
  - Surveys and interviews collect self-reported attitudes, beliefs, and experiences
  - Results depend on wording, response bias, and sampling
  - Random sampling supports generalization to a population
- What to write down
  - Random sampling supports generalization.
  - Random assignment supports causal inference.

### Segment E: Correlational research

- Main ideas
  - Correlation describes an association between variables
  - Correlation can support prediction
  - Correlation does not establish causation
  - Directionality and third variables remain unresolved
- What to write down
  - Correlation does not prove causation.

### Segment F: Experiments and causal inference

- Main ideas
  - Experiments manipulate an independent variable
  - Experiments measure effects on a dependent variable
  - Control groups support comparison
  - Placebos and blinding can reduce expectancy effects in many contexts
- What to write down
  - Independent variable is manipulated.
  - Dependent variable is measured.

### Segment G: Proper research practices and ethics preview

- Main ideas
  - Study design requires clear variables, procedures, and comparison logic
  - Replication strengthens confidence in findings
  - Informed consent is a baseline participant protection
- What to write down
  - Ethics is part of study design, not an afterthought.

## Common confusions to avoid

- Confusion
  - Confidence equals correctness
- Confusion
  - Bigger samples automatically fix biased sampling
- Confusion
  - Correlation establishes causation
- Confusion
  - Surveys measure behavior directly
- Confusion
  - Random sampling and random assignment are interchangeable
- Confusion
  - Any two-group comparison counts as an experiment

## Quick check for Video 2

- Pick a single research question and answer for each method
  - What can this method conclude
  - What can this method not conclude
- Methods
  - case study
  - naturalistic observation
  - survey or interview
  - correlational study
  - experiment
