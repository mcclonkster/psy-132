# Week 3 Crash Course Companion

## How to use this document

- Watch the listed videos with this companion open
- For each segment, write the What to write down line in your own notes
- Use the quick checks to test yourself before class and before Quiz Q03
- Use the key terms as your Week 3 vocabulary list

## What you are responsible for in Week 3

### Topic 8 Perception responsibilities

- Define perception and distinguish it from sensation
- Explain bottom-up processing and top-down processing
- Explain how context, expectations, and prior knowledge can shape perception
- Use at least one perceptual-organization concept correctly, such as grouping or constancy
- Explain that perception is an active interpretation process rather than a direct copy of reality

### Topic 9 Consciousness responsibilities

- Define consciousness in a course-appropriate way
- Identify major states of consciousness discussed in Week 3
  - waking
  - sleeping
  - dreaming
- Explain circadian rhythm as a basic idea
- Describe the basic structure of sleep and how stages differ at a high level
- Describe at least one scientific theory or function claim about dreaming at a high level

# Topic 8 companion
Perception

## Videos for Topic 8

- Crash Course Psychology #6 Homunculus
- Crash Course Psychology #7 Perceiving is Believing

## Learning targets

- Distinguish sensation and perception clearly
- Explain bottom-up and top-down processing with an example
- Describe at least two ways perception can be systematically biased or shaped
  - context effects
  - expectations
  - perceptual set
- Use at least one perceptual-organization concept correctly
- Explain why illusions are useful for studying perception

## Key terms

- perception
- sensation
- bottom-up processing
- top-down processing
- perceptual set
- context effects
- selective attention
- feature detection
- perceptual organization
- grouping
- figure-ground
- depth perception

## Segment guide

### Segment A: Perception as interpretation

- Main ideas
  - Perception is the process of organizing and interpreting sensory input
  - Two people can perceive the same input differently
- What to write down
  - Perception is the brain making meaning from sensory information.

### Segment B: Bottom-up and top-down processing

- Main ideas
  - Bottom-up processing starts with sensory input
  - Top-down processing uses prior knowledge, expectations, and context
- What to write down
  - Bottom-up starts with data, and top-down uses knowledge to interpret the data.

### Segment C: Context and expectations

- Main ideas
  - Expectations can shape what you notice and how you interpret it
  - Context can change what the same stimulus seems to be
- What to write down
  - Perception depends on both the stimulus and the mind interpreting it.

### Segment D: Perceptual organization

- Main ideas
  - The brain organizes input into objects and patterns
  - Grouping and figure-ground are basic examples of organization
- What to write down
  - The brain organizes sensory input into meaningful patterns and objects.

### Segment E: Illusions as evidence

- Main ideas
  - Illusions show systematic patterns in perception
  - Illusions reveal how the brain makes assumptions
- What to write down
  - Illusions help reveal the rules the brain uses to interpret input.

## Common confusions to avoid

- Confusion
  - Perception is a perfect copy of the world
- Confusion
  - Top-down processing means making things up
- Confusion
  - If you experience an illusion, it means your senses failed
- Confusion
  - What you see is always what is there

## Quick check for Topic 8

- Give one example of bottom-up processing and one example of top-down processing
- Describe one context effect that could change perception
- Explain why an illusion can be useful evidence rather than a mistake

# Topic 9 companion
Consciousness

## Videos for Topic 9

- Crash Course Psychology #8 Consciousness
- Crash Course Psychology #9 To Sleep, Perchance to Dream

## Learning targets

- Define consciousness in a course-appropriate way
- Identify major states of consciousness discussed in Week 3
- Explain circadian rhythm at a basic level
- Describe sleep stages at a high level and explain how REM and NREM differ
- Describe at least one major scientific theory or function claim about dreaming at a high level

## Key terms

- consciousness
- awareness
- attention
- controlled processing
- automatic processing
- circadian rhythm
- sleep
- insomnia
- sleep deprivation
- REM sleep
- NREM sleep
- dreaming

## Segment guide

### Segment A: What consciousness refers to

- Main ideas
  - Consciousness involves awareness of self and environment
  - Attention is limited and selective
- What to write down
  - Consciousness is awareness of ourselves and our environment.

### Segment B: States of consciousness

- Main ideas
  - Consciousness can change across states such as waking and sleeping
  - Different states have different patterns of experience and behavior
- What to write down
  - Consciousness varies across states such as waking, sleeping, and dreaming.

### Segment C: Circadian rhythm

- Main ideas
  - Sleep and alertness follow daily biological rhythms
  - Environment and behavior can shift or disrupt those rhythms
- What to write down
  - Circadian rhythm is a daily cycle that influences sleep and alertness.

### Segment D: Sleep stages

- Main ideas
  - Sleep includes multiple stages, not a single uniform state
  - REM and NREM differ in brain activity and dreaming likelihood
- What to write down
  - Sleep cycles through stages, including NREM and REM.

### Segment E: Why we dream

- Main ideas
  - There are multiple scientific theories about dreaming
  - Dreaming is not fully explained by one simple purpose claim
- What to write down
  - Dreaming has multiple theories, and evidence is mixed across explanations.

## Common confusions to avoid

- Confusion
  - Consciousness is either on or off
- Confusion
  - Sleep is passive and the brain is inactive
- Confusion
  - Everyone sleeps the same way with the same schedule and stages
- Confusion
  - Dreaming has one proven purpose

## Quick check for Topic 9

- In one sentence, define consciousness
- In two sentences, explain circadian rhythm and why it matters for sleep
- Describe one difference between REM and NREM sleep
- Name one theory about dreaming and state what it claims at a high level
