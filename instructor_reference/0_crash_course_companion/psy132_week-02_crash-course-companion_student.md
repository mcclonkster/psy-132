Neuroscience

## Videos for Topic 6

- Crash Course Psychology #3 The Chemical Mind
- Crash Course Psychology #4 Meet Your Master Getting to Know Your Brain

## Learning targets

- Explain how neurons send and receive signals
- Use synapse and neurotransmitter correctly in a sentence
- Name the basic divisions of the nervous system and their roles
- Identify a small set of major brain structures and connect each to a broad function
- Explain why psychology can be studied at a biological level without reducing it to only biology

- synapse
- neurotransmitter
- excitatory
- inhibitory
- central nervous system
- peripheral nervous system
- spinal cord
- brainstem
- cerebellum
- thalamus

## Segment guide

### Segment A: The neuron as the basic unit

- Main ideas
  - Neurons are specialized cells that communicate using electrical and chemical signals
  - Neurons have parts that support receiving, integrating, and sending signals
- What to write down
  - Neurons are cells that communicate information by sending signals to other neurons.

### Segment B: Synapses and neurotransmitters

- Main ideas
  - Neurons pass signals to other neurons at synapses
  - Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers that influence whether a signal continues
- What to write down
  - A synapse is a junction where neurons communicate, often using neurotransmitters.

### Segment C: Big-picture nervous system organization

- Main ideas
  - The nervous system can be divided into central and peripheral systems
  - The central nervous system includes the brain and spinal cord
  - The peripheral nervous system connects the body to the central nervous system
- What to write down
  - The central nervous system is brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system connects the rest of the body to it.

### Segment D: Brain structures and broad functions

- Main ideas
  - The brain contains older and newer structures with different roles
  - Major structures can be described at a high level without memorizing fine detail
- What to write down
  - Different brain regions contribute to different functions, and behavior emerges from networks working together.

### Segment E: Connecting brain and behavior

- Main ideas
  - Brain structure is linked to what people can do, feel, and experience
  - Neuroscience supports psychological explanations rather than replacing them
- What to write down
  - Biological explanations and psychological explanations can be different levels of the same system.

## Common confusions to avoid

- Confusion
  - Neurons are like wires that only do electricity
- Confusion
  - Neurotransmitters are the same thing as neurons
- Confusion
  - One brain region equals one behavior in a simple one-to-one way
- Confusion
  - Biological explanations make psychological explanations unnecessary

## Quick check for Topic 6

- In two to three sentences, explain how a neuron communicates with another neuron
- Name three brain structures from the key terms list and give a broad function for each
- Explain the difference between central nervous system and peripheral nervous system

# Topic 7 companion
Sensation

## Video for Topic 7

- Crash Course Psychology #5 Sensation and Perception

## Learning targets

- Define sensation and distinguish it from perception
- Explain transduction and sensory receptors
- Use threshold terms correctly and apply them to a simple example
- Explain sensory adaptation and give an everyday example

## Key terms

- sensation
- perception
- sensory receptor
- transduction
- bottom-up processing
- top-down processing
- absolute threshold
- difference threshold
- just noticeable difference
- signal detection theory
- sensory adaptation

## Segment guide

### Segment A: Sensation and perception

- Main ideas
  - Sensation is detecting physical energy and sending signals to the nervous system
  - Perception is the brain organizing and interpreting the sensory signals
- What to write down
  - Sensation detects input, and perception interprets what the input means.

### Segment B: Transduction

- Main ideas
  - Sensory receptors respond to specific types of physical energy
  - Transduction converts that energy into neural signals the brain can use
- What to write down
  - Transduction converts physical energy into neural signals.

### Segment C: Thresholds and detection

- Main ideas
  - Absolute threshold is the minimum stimulation needed to detect something part of the time
  - Difference threshold is the minimum difference needed to notice a change
  - Signal detection theory explains why detection depends on both sensation and decision factors
- What to write down
  - Thresholds describe the minimum intensity needed to detect a stimulus or detect a change.

### Segment D: Sensory adaptation

- Main ideas
  - Sensory systems reduce attention to constant stimulation over time
  - Adaptation helps detect change and novelty
- What to write down
  - Sensory adaptation is reduced sensitivity to constant stimulation.

## Common confusions to avoid

- Confusion
  - Sensation and perception are the same thing
- Confusion
  - Thresholds are fixed numbers that never change
- Confusion
  - If you do not detect something, your sensory system failed
- Confusion
  - Sensory adaptation means the stimulus disappears rather than your response changing

## Quick check for Topic 7

- Give one example of transduction in everyday life
- Write a two-sentence explanation of the difference between absolute threshold and difference threshold
- Give one example of sensory adaptation and explain why it might be useful
