## Student accountability for Week 3 and Quiz Q03

Students are responsible for the following.

- Perception versus sensation distinction
- Bottom-up and top-down processing and an example of each
- Context and expectation effects on perception
- At least one perceptual-organization concept
- Why illusions are useful for understanding perception

Students are not responsible for memorizing detailed anatomy terms beyond the key terms unless explicitly assigned.

## Instructor intent

- Students leave Topic 8 able to explain why perception is not a direct recording
- Students can use bottom-up and top-down language accurately
- Students can treat illusions as evidence about processing rules

## Misconceptions to surface and correct

- Perception is a perfect copy of reality
- Top-down processing means making things up
- If you experience an illusion, it means your senses failed
- People should perceive the same stimulus the same way
- Attention can take in everything in the environment

## Key terms

- perception
- sensation
- bottom-up processing
- top-down processing
- perceptual set
- context effects
- selective attention
- feature detection
- perceptual organization
- grouping
- figure-ground
- depth perception
- perceptual constancy
- illusion

## Segment guide with integrated instructor notes

### Segment A: Perception as interpretation

- Student main ideas
  - Perception organizes and interprets sensory input
  - Interpretation can vary across people and contexts
- Student write-down line
  - Perception is the brain making meaning from sensory information.
- Instructor talk move
  - Use the same ambiguous stimulus twice with different context cues
- Instructor discussion prompt
  - What changed, the stimulus or the interpretation
- Instructor misconception correction
  - Perception is constructed from input plus interpretation

### Segment B: Bottom-up and top-down processing

- Student main ideas
  - Bottom-up starts with sensory input
  - Top-down uses expectations, knowledge, and context
- Student write-down line
  - Bottom-up starts with data, and top-down uses knowledge to interpret the data.
- Instructor talk move
  - Ask students to name one top-down influence in the ambiguous stimulus
- Instructor discussion prompt
  - When is top-down processing helpful and when can it mislead
- Instructor misconception correction
  - Top-down processing is a normal feature of perception, not a flaw by itself

### Segment C: Context and expectations

- Student main ideas
  - Expectations guide attention and interpretation
  - Context can change what the same stimulus seems to be
- Student write-down line
  - Perception depends on both the stimulus and the mind interpreting it.
- Instructor talk move
  - Quick perceptual set demonstration using word or image priming
- Instructor discussion prompt
  - How could two honest witnesses perceive the same event differently
- Instructor misconception correction
  - Differences in perception can occur without deception

### Segment D: Perceptual organization

- Student main ideas
  - The brain groups input into objects and patterns
  - Figure-ground is a basic example
- Student write-down line
  - The brain organizes sensory input into meaningful patterns and objects.
- Instructor talk move
  - Have students describe figure and background in the same image
- Instructor discussion prompt
  - Why does perception need grouping rules at all
- Instructor misconception correction
  - Organization is required because raw input is underdetermined

### Segment E: Illusions as evidence

- Student main ideas
  - Illusions reveal systematic rules and shortcuts
  - Illusions show the assumptions perception uses
- Student write-down line
  - Illusions help reveal the rules the brain uses to interpret input.
- Instructor talk move
  - Use one illusion and ask students to predict where other people will be fooled
- Instructor discussion prompt
  - What does it mean that the illusion works on many people
- Instructor misconception correction
  - Illusions can be consistent and predictable, which makes them useful evidence

## Quick check for Topic 8

- Students provide one example each
  - bottom-up processing
  - top-down processing
- Students answer in one short paragraph
  - why illusions can count as evidence about perception

# Topic 9 companion
Consciousness

## Videos for Topic 9

- Crash Course Psychology #8 Consciousness
- Crash Course Psychology #9 To Sleep, Perchance to Dream

## Student accountability for Week 3 and Quiz Q03

Students are responsible for the following.

- Consciousness as awareness of self and environment in a basic course sense
- States of consciousness discussed in Week 3
  - waking, sleeping, dreaming
- Circadian rhythm as a basic idea
- Sleep stages at a high level and the distinction between REM and NREM
- At least one theory about dreaming

Students are not responsible for detailed neurochemistry of sleep or for drug categories unless explicitly assigned.

## Instructor intent

- Students leave Topic 9 with a usable definition of consciousness
- Students can describe sleep as structured and active rather than passive
- Students can avoid single-purpose claims about dreaming

## Misconceptions to surface and correct

- Consciousness is either fully on or fully off
- Sleep is passive and the brain is inactive
- Everyone has the same sleep schedule and stage pattern
- Dreaming has one proven purpose
- Dreams predict the future in a scientific sense

## Key terms

- consciousness
- awareness
- attention
- controlled processing
- automatic processing
- circadian rhythm
- sleep
- insomnia
- sleep deprivation
- REM sleep
- NREM sleep
- dreaming

## Segment guide with integrated instructor notes

### Segment A: What consciousness refers to

- Student main ideas
  - Consciousness involves awareness of self and environment
  - Attention is limited and selective
- Student write-down line
  - Consciousness is awareness of ourselves and our environment.
- Instructor talk move
  - Use a brief attention limitation demonstration such as counting passes
- Instructor discussion prompt
  - What does it mean that attention has limits
- Instructor misconception correction
  - Limited attention is normal and predictable, not a personal failure

### Segment B: States of consciousness

- Student main ideas
  - Consciousness varies across waking, sleeping, and dreaming
  - States differ in experience and responsiveness
- Student write-down line
  - Consciousness varies across states such as waking, sleeping, and dreaming.
- Instructor talk move
  - Ask students to list one feature that changes between waking and dreaming
- Instructor discussion prompt
  - Which parts of experience change most across states
- Instructor misconception correction
  - The boundary between states can be gradual rather than instant

### Segment C: Circadian rhythm

- Student main ideas
  - Sleep and alertness follow daily biological rhythms
  - Behavior and environment can shift or disrupt rhythms
- Student write-down line
  - Circadian rhythm is a daily cycle that influences sleep and alertness.
- Instructor talk move
  - Connect circadian rhythm to a concrete student-relevant example such as shift work or late-night screens
- Instructor discussion prompt
  - Why does a daily cycle matter for learning and mood
- Instructor misconception correction
  - Sleep problems are not always about willpower

### Segment D: Sleep stages

- Student main ideas
  - Sleep has multiple stages
  - REM and NREM differ in typical patterns
- Student write-down line
  - Sleep cycles through stages, including NREM and REM.
- Instructor talk move
  - Have students label a simple cycle diagram with NREM and REM
- Instructor discussion prompt
  - Why might the brain cycle rather than stay in one stage
- Instructor misconception correction
  - Sleep is active and organized, not a blank shutdown

### Segment E: Why we dream

- Student main ideas
  - There are multiple theories about dreaming
  - Evidence does not fully support one single-purpose explanation
- Student write-down line
  - Dreaming has multiple theories, and evidence is mixed across explanations.
- Instructor talk move
  - Present two theories and ask what evidence would distinguish them
- Instructor discussion prompt
  - What would count as evidence that a dream theory is wrong
- Instructor misconception correction
  - Scientific theories are evaluated by evidence, not by how meaningful the story feels

## Quick check for Topic 9

- Students answer in one sentence
  - consciousness
- Students answer in two sentences
  - circadian rhythm and why it matters
- Students answer in one sentence
  - one difference between REM and NREM
- Students name one dream theory and state its claim at a high level
