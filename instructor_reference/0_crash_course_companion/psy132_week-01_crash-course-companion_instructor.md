## Segment guide with integrated instructor notes

### Segment A: What psychology is

- Student main ideas
  - Psychology studies behavior and mental processes
  - Psychology aims to understand and predict behavior using evidence-based approaches
- Student write-down line
  - Psychology is the scientific study of behavior and mental processes.
- Instructor talk move
  - Elicit one behavior example and one mental-process example, then categorize
- Instructor discussion prompt
  - Which is easier to observe directly, behavior or mental processes, and what does psychology do about that
- Instructor misconception correction
  - Mental processes are inferred from evidence and measured through methods rather than assumed from intuition

### Segment B: Why psychology is a science

- Student main ideas
  - Personal experience can feel convincing while still being misleading
  - Scientific approaches reduce error by using systematic observation and testing
- Student write-down line
  - Science uses systematic methods to build and test explanations and reduce bias and error.
- Instructor talk move
  - Prompt a confident claim about behavior, then ask what evidence would change the claim
- Instructor discussion prompt
  - What counts as disconfirming evidence in psychology
- Instructor misconception correction
  - Confidence and anecdote have low diagnostic value without systematic methods

### Segment C: Early perspectives and what they prioritized

#### Structuralism

- Student main ideas
  - Structuralism aimed to identify the elements of conscious experience
  - Introspection was used to report experience in a structured way
  - Reliability limits follow from subjectivity and variability across people
- Student write-down line
  - Structuralism focused on the components of conscious experience, often using introspection.
- Instructor talk move
  - Run a brief introspection demonstration and compare variability across students
- Instructor discussion prompt
  - What reliability problems appear when a method depends on subjective report
- Instructor misconception correction
  - Introspection can generate useful data, but reliability constraints limit what it can support on its own

#### Functionalism

- Student main ideas
  - Functionalism focused on what mental processes and behavior do
  - Emphasis on function and adaptation in context
- Student write-down line
  - Functionalism focused on the function of behavior and mental processes.
- Instructor talk move
  - Use anxiety as an example and separate possible function from harmful intensity
- Instructor discussion prompt
  - How can the same process support adaptation in one context and impair functioning in another
- Instructor misconception correction
  - Function language can be misread as moral approval or universal benefit, so the context boundary must be explicit

#### Psychoanalysis

- Student main ideas
  - Psychoanalysis emphasized unconscious influences and internal conflict
  - Historically influential and also debated
- Student write-down line
  - Psychoanalysis emphasizes unconscious processes that can influence thoughts and behavior.
- Instructor talk move
  - Use a neutral example of nonconscious influence on attention or choice
- Instructor discussion prompt
  - What does a mental process look like when it influences behavior outside awareness
- Instructor misconception correction
  - Unconscious processes can be described as mental activity outside awareness, without supernatural framing

#### Behaviorism

- Student main ideas
  - Behaviorism emphasized observable behavior and measurable environmental influences
  - Emphasis on measurement and testing
- Student write-down line
  - Behaviorism focuses on observable behavior and how it is shaped by learning and environment.
- Instructor talk move
  - Rewrite mentalistic explanations into observable behavior descriptions
- Instructor discussion prompt
  - What is gained and what is lost when explanations emphasize only observable behavior
- Instructor misconception correction
  - Behavior-focused methods prioritize measurement and observability; they do not require claims about the nonexistence of mental life

### Segment D: Integration and modern psychology

- Student main ideas
  - Psychology includes multiple perspectives because behavior is complex
  - Different perspectives use different tools and answer different questions
- Student write-down line
  - Different perspectives answer different questions and use different tools.
- Instructor talk move
  - Present one research question and ask which perspective fits best and why
- Instructor discussion prompt
  - Which level of explanation best fits a given question, biological, cognitive, behavioral, or social
- Instructor misconception correction
  - Multiple perspectives imply multiple tools, not relativism

## Quick check for Video 1

- Prompt
  - Choose one perspective and answer both
    - What does it focus on
    - What does it tend to ignore or downplay
- Scoring note
  - Priorities and limits are required for full credit
  - Name-only responses do not meet the target
