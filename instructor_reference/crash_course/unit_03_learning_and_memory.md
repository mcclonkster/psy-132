So, the name Ivan Pavlov rings a bell it's because his experiments are among the most famous in the history of psychology. His work contributed to the foundation of the behaviorist school of thought that viewed psychology as an empirically rigorous science, focused on observable behaviors and not unobservable internal mental processes. Even though today we view psychology as the science of both behavior and mental processes, Pavlov's influence was tremendous. His research helped pave the path for more experimental rigor and behavioral research right up to the present day. Born in 1849 in Russia, Pavlov was never much for psychology. After giving up on his original aspiration to become a Russian Orthodox priest like his father,

he instead earned a medical degree and spent nearly 20 years studying the digestive system, earning Russia's first Nobel Prize in his mid-50s for his research expanding our understanding of how stomachs worked. He didn't study human stomachs, though, because the procedures were terrible and cruel. He studied dog stomachs. And while researching those dogs, he noticed how the animals would salivate at a mere whiff of their dinner. At first, he found all that slobber annoying, but soon started to suspect that this behavior was actually a simple but important form of learning. For us scholars of psychology, we can define learning as the process of acquiring, through experience, new and relatively enduring information or behaviors. Whether through association,

observation, or just plain thinking, learning is what allows us to adapt to our environments and to survive. And as Pavlov began to discover, it wasn't only humans who learned. Soon enough, he was turning out his famous series of experiments in which he paired the presence of meat powder -- yummy -- which got the dogs to drooling, with lots of different neutral stimuli. Things that wouldn't normally make you drool, like a certain sound or shining a light or a touch on the leg. Then Pavlov observed, after several of these pairings, a dog would start to drool just at the sound or the light or the touch, even if there wasn't any slobber-inducing meat powder around. Animals, he found, can exhibit associative learning. That's when a subject links certain events, behaviors,

or stimuli together in the process of conditioning. This may be the most elemental, basic form of learning a brain can do, but that doesn't mean that the processes behind conditioning are, or ever were, obvious, or, for that matter, simple. In fact, the research that's gone into how we're conditioned by our environments has helped shape the science of psychology from a still-kinda-subjective thought exercise into the more rigorous discipline we know today. And it starred some of psychology's most notable, and often controversial, figures including Pavlov, BF Skinner, and that guy who trained kids to be terrified of furry animals. [INTRO MUSIC] Okay, I'm not a licensed dog trainer (do they license dog trainers?),

but I can break down for you the sequence of steps in Pavlov's famous experiment to help you get a sense of how conditioning works. First, before conditioning, the dog just drools when it smells food. That smell is the unconditioned stimulus and the slobbering, the unconditioned or natural response. The ringing sound, which at this point means nothing to the dog, is the neutral stimulus, and it produces no drooling. During conditioning, the unconditioned stimulus -- the food smell -- is paired with the neutral stimulus -- the bell sound -- and results in drooling. This is repeated many times until the association between the two stimuli is made in a stage called acquisition. By the time you get to the after-conditioning

phase, that old neutral stimulus has become a conditioned stimulus, because it now elicits the conditioned response of drooling. Sounds super simple, right? If you have a dog, you've probably seen it tap-dance at the sight of a leash, but in Pavlov's day, this whole series of steps hadn't really been studied in a lab setting, or even thought about in scientific terms. Pavlov's work suggested that classical conditioning, as this kind of learning came to be known, could be an adaptive form of learning that helps an animal survive by changing its behavior to better suit its environment. In this case, a bell means food, and food means survival, so get ready! Not only, that but methodologically, classical conditioning shows how a process like learning can

actually be studied through direct observation of behavior in real-time, without all those messy feelings and emotions. This is something Pavlov especially appreciated, given his disdain for "mentalistic concepts" like consciousness and introspection, championed by Freud. Behaviorist psychologists like Pavlov's younger American analogs, BF Skinner and John B Watson, also embraced the notion that psychology was all about objective, observable behavior. In his 1930 book, Behaviorism, he argued that given a dozen healthy infants, he could train any one of them to be a doctor, artist, lawyer, or even a thief, regardless of their talents, tendencies, or ancestry. Woah there, Watson! Thankfully, no one gave him any infants.

In his most famous, and yes, controversial experiment, Watson conditioned a young child dubbed "Little Albert" to fear a white rat. Maybe that doesn't sound so bad, but he accomplished this by pairing the rat with a loud scary noise over and over. And then demonstrated that the terror could branch out and be generalized to include other furry white objects, like bunnies, dogs, and even fur coats. So yeah, that would not fly today, obviously. But Watson's research did make other psychologists wonder whether adults, too, were just holding tanks of conditioned emotions. And if so, whether new conditioning could be used to undo old conditioning. Like, if you're terrified of rollercoasters, but you made yourself ride one ten times a day for two weeks,

would your fears fade? For the record, recent exploration has revealed that the boy known as "Little Albert" sadly died a few years after these experiments, while Watson eventually left academia and got into advertising, where he put all that associative learning to lucrative use. So that's classical conditioning, but we've also got another kind of associative learning: operant conditioning. If classical conditioning is all about forming associations between stimuli, operant conditioning involves associating our own behavior with consequences. The kid who gets a cookie for saying "please," or the aquarium seal that gets a sardine for balancing a ball on its nose -- they've both been trained with operant conditioning. The basic premise here is that behaviors increase

when followed by reinforcement or reward, but they decrease when followed by punishment. And the most well-known champion of operant conditioning is American behaviorist, B.F. Skinner. He designed the famous operant chamber or "Skinner Box" -- a confined space containing a lever or button than an animal can touch to get some kind of reward (typically food), along with the device that keeps track of its responses. Okay, time for a debunking break. Other than maybe Freud, no other figure in psychology seems to be as shrouded in lore and misinformation as B.F. Skinner. So I'm just gonna tell you straight that no, Skinner never put any kids in the box, and no, he didn't raise his children without love or affection. And his daughter didn't

hate his guts until the day she committed suicide. Deborah Skinner is alive and well and she loved her dad plenty. Skinner did, however, invent something called an "Air Crib" -- a climate-controlled box with a window on the front that was meant to keep babies warm and safe while their moms ran around doing their 1950s lady thang. It's not exactly where I'd like to spend the night, but it wasn't remotely the same as the Skinner Box. No one knows where all these myths came from, but being a somewhat controversial guy, Skinner had a lot of haters. Some of whom were probably happy to perpetuate misinformation. But back to the rat in the box. Basically, the box provided an observable stage to demonstrate Skinner's concept of reinforcement, which is

anything that increases the behavior that it follows. In other words, you push the lever, you get a snack, and then you want to keep pushing the lever. But most rats aren't gonna push a lever for no reason. I mean, there aren't food dispensing levers in the natural environment. So operant conditioning behavior requires shaping. Maybe you give the rat a little nibble of food each time it gets closer to the bar, then only when it touches the bar, until little by little, in a series of successive approximations to the desired behavior, you reward them only when they do the thing you're trying to shape them to do. In everyday life, we're all continually reinforcing, shaping, and refining each other's behaviors, both intentionally and accidentally.

We do this with both positive and negative reinforcement. Positive reinforcement obviously strengthens responses by giving rewards after a desired event, like the rat snack after the lever push, or getting a cookie when you say please. Negative reinforcement is a little trickier -- it's what increases a behavior by taking away an aversive or upsetting stimulus, like, say, you get in your car and it does that infernal beeping thing until you fasten your seat belt. The car is reinforcing your seatbelt-wearing by getting rid of that horrible beeping. And it's good. You should wear your seatbelt. It's important to recognize here that negative reinforcement is not the same as punishment.

Punishment decreases a behavior, either positively, by, say, getting a speeding ticket, or negatively, by taking away a driver's license. But negative reinforcement removes the punishing event to increase the behavior. So pain killers negatively reinforce the behavior of swallowing them by ending the headache. So by now, hopefully, you're getting the picture. There are things that we want and things that we don't want, and we can be taught by way of those impulses to behave certain ways. But it's worth pointing out that the conditioning is way more complex than just the cookie in the beeping car. For one thing, ending annoyance or getting a cookie are types of primary reinforcers. You don't have to learn that; they just make innate biological sense. Beeping is

annoying; cookies are delicious. So there are other kinds of reinforcers that we only recognize after we learn to associate them with primary reinforcers, like a paycheck is a conditioned reinforcer. We want money because we need food and shelter, which are still the primary drivers, plus just as there are different kinds of reinforcers, so are there various reinforcement schedules. Like, those box rats were getting continuous reinforcement when they got a treat every single time they hit the lever, so they picked it up pretty quickly. But if one day, the rat chow doesn't come, that connection quickly dwindles and the rat stops hitting the lever. This is a process called extinction, and it is important because that's how real life works. Outside

of a Skinner Box, you're not gonna get continuous reinforcement. All of life is a series of partial or intermittent reinforcements that only occurs sometimes. Learning under these conditions takes longer, but it holds up better in the long run, and is less susceptible to that extinction. So, say a cafe gives out a free cup of coffee for every 10 you buy, while another shop pours a free double shot every Tuesday morning, and yet another has a free coffee lottery that customers win at random. These are all different kinds of intermittent reinforcement techniques that get customers coming back for more. Now, Pavlov, Watson, and Skinner's ideas were definitely controversial, as well as the whole scary rat experiment, plenty of

folks disagreed with their insistence that only external influences and not internal thoughts and feelings shaped behavior. It was clear to many of the behaviorists' rivals that our cognitive processes -- our thoughts, perceptions, feelings, memories -- also influence the way we learn. We're gonna talk about how these other things factor into learning next week, when we look more at conditioning, cognition, and observational learning. And yeah, also watch kids beat the face off blowup dolls. Today, though, you learned how associative learning works; the essentials of behaviorist theory; the basic components of classical and operant conditioning, including positive and negative reinforcement; and reinforcement scheduling.

### Transcript (reading)

It’s 1961. You’re wandering around Stanford University, looking for a sandwich or something when you happen to walk by a particular room in a particular lab, and see something a little unnerving. Namely, you find a woman punching an inflatable clown named Bobo in the neck. Over and over in its neck. This was the lab of legendary psychologist Albert Bandura, and in 1961 he was studying one of the most important phenomena in psychology. See, while the woman was throttling that big inflatable clown, there was a child watching her. And after about ten minutes of observing this clown-beating display, the kid was taken to a room full of fun toys, which were soon taken away, and then the frustrated kid was left alone with Bobo, and Bandura watched what happened.

And yeah, what happened was kind of scary. Kids who watched the woman beating the clown were much more likely to mimic her aggression -- kicking, punching, throwing, even attempting to maul Bobo with a hammer. But other children who saw an adult playing nicely with the doll, or just ignoring it, didn’t respond the same way in their frustration. Bandura’s results may seem predictable now, but in those days, they challenged the dominant behaviorist views that we talked about last week -- the views that learning is solely about conditioning and association, rewards and punishments. Bandura’s research focused on how learning can occur through observing and imitating someone else’s behavior.

And if that seems obvious to you, you have Bandura to thank for that. His research hastened the evolution of 20th century experimental psychology from pure behaviorism into what we now know as social-cognitive learning. While it was closely related to behaviorism, the social-cognitive models added profoundly new dimensions to what Skinner and Watson and Pavlov had observed in our feathered and furry friends. In other words, it showed us that -- just as there’s more than one way to beat up a clown -- there’s way more than one way to learn. [INTRO] Last week we talked about the differences between classical and operant conditioning in associative learning -- the kind of learning that comes from connecting different events and stimuli.

In classical conditioning, this means associating a stimulus with some kind of involuntary response -- the whole dog slobbering at the sound of a bell phenomenon -- whereas operant conditioning makes associations between stimulus and a voluntary behavior -- like the rat pressing a lever to get delicious snacks, or jumping out of a cage to escape an electrical shock. And that’s all well and good, but if learning is the process of acquiring and retaining new behavior and information, then Bandura’s experiments showed us that conditioning with external rewards, punishments, or other stimuli isn’t the only way to do it. It’s hard to deny that pretty much all animals are capable of learning certain things by

association, but critics of behaviorists like Pavlov, Watson, and Skinner had a problem with their assertions that, when it came to learning, it didn’t matter much whether you’re training rats, pigeons, or people--it’s all the same. Because, lots of research has demonstrated that an animal’s capacity for conditioning is actually limited by its biology. Consider this scenario: Say I get a raging case of food poisoning after eating my head-weight in raw oysters with my friend Bernice. I’m probably not going to want to touch oysters again for a long, long time, because I associate their smell and taste with the smell and taste they made when I was — when they were coming back out, is what I’m trying to say.

But, that doesn’t mean that the sight of Bernice, or the sound of the sea shanties they were playing at the restaurant would make me barf, because humans are, by our very nature, more taste averse than we are sight or sound averse. On the other hand, sight-oriented animals, like birds, may be biologically predisposed to avoid tainted food by sight, since that’s how they hunt and forage. And presumably they go to restaurants that play better music. Anyway, all of this tells us that species can more easily learn associations that help them thrive or survive, and that not all associations are learned equally. It’s a lot easier to teach a pigeon to peck an X on the ground to obtain a food reward than it is get it to flap its wings to get that same reward, because pecking is a natural

foraging behavior for a pigeon. In the same way, it would be much harder for the bird to learn to peck that X to avoid a shock, rather than to flap its wings to avoid the shock, because flying away from danger is what pigeons naturally do. Learned associations are even more complicated in humans of course, because what we learn doesn’t only influence our behavior, it also shapes our attitudes. Our cognition -- that is, our thoughts, perspectives, and expectations -- is important for learning, as is our social context, as Bandura figured out. So, Pavlov-style conditioning experiments that ignore those social-cognitive elements can really run into trouble. For example, someone under treatment for an alcohol addiction may be given booze laced with a nauseating drug.

According to the pure classical conditioning model, that person would then equate booze with feeling nasty. But the brain can override this association if it’s aware that it’s the added drug, and not the alcohol, is the thing that’s causing the illness. Sometimes we can think our way out of intended associations. And by the same token, a person’s social context - like, their friends, family traditions, or life stressors - can reinforce something like alcohol consumption more than the nauseating pill could ever punish it. Plus, we also do a lot of latent learning, like without even knowing it. Have you ever been walking around a new city, someone stops you to ask directions, and you surprise yourself by actually being able to tell that tourist how to get to the park?

That’s because we’re constantly developing cognitive maps, or mental representations of our surroundings, without explicitly telling ourselves to do it. We’ve all seen the experiments with in mazes: Well, those show us that even rats develop these cognitive maps, figuring out how to get around, even if there’s no reward at the end. And days later, when they finally do get food at the end of the maze, they quickly demonstrate all that earlier latent learning by scuttling through the maze as fast, or faster, than rats that had been rewarded all along. So, learning isn’t just about associating a response with a consequence. There’s thinking happening, too. And this kind of thinking is also a big part of observational learning, which is basically

learning by watching other people, or being influenced by them in other ways. Because, you don’t need direct experience to learn. You can just pick up stuff up through modeling -- not like modeling on the catwalk, I just mean observing and imitating specific behaviors. Rats, crows, pigeons, primates, and other animals learn through imitation. Chimps learn how to use sticks to fish ants out of a nest this way. One study found rhesus macaques were usually slow to make up after a fight unless they grew up watching more forgiving older macaques, in which case they tended to make up more quickly. Of course we humans learn A LOT from modeling -- I mean, most of our popular culture is based on it: new slang, skinny jeans, foodie trends, pixie cuts -- they’re all racing

around the globe through observation and imitation. So it makes a lot of sense that social observation shapes behavior, especially in children. Which brings us back to Bobo. Again, the fact that we learn by imitating, even when we don’t mean to, seems pretty intuitive, but until Bandura’s famous experiment, it hadn’t been studied in a scientific way. I mean, these kids started abusing Bobo not just with little toddler punches, but with hostile language and even using things, like toy guns, that they previously had no interest in -- and all because they saw aggressive modeling in action. And since Bandura’s time, technology has allowed us to peer even deeper into this dynamic.

Neuroimaging in humans, for instance, has shown that when an individual watches someone else, especially someone whom they relate to, receive an award or score a goal or something, their own brain’s reward systems light up vicariously. Italian researchers found this out pretty much by accident in the early 1990s: They were studying signals from key regions in a lab monkey’s brain that were associated with planning and doing. Their brain-monitoring device buzzed softly when the monkey did something like pick up a piece of fruit and eat it. But one hot day, a researcher came back from lunch licking an ice cream cone, and suddenly heard the animal’s brain monitor buzz -- the monkey was watching him, and his brain worked as if it was actually doing the licking.

Many scientists suspect that this is the work of a previously unknown type of brain cell called mirror neurons, which fire when a subject both performs an action, and when they observe someone else doing it. Mirror neuron research is still relatively new, and we’re still figuring them out, but combined with Bandura’s earlier work, it’s revealing a strong connection between observation, imitation, and learning. So the takeaway here is: Models are important! And not just Gisele and Antonio Sabato Junior. You can, if you want, observe and imitate them; I’m just saying that observational, social learning starts really early, and parental figures are powerful role models. Positive, supportive, and loving models usually prompt similar behavior in others, just as

negative, aggressive modeling can spark antisocial effects. And, as we’ll talk about later, what we see and feel and learn as children is not easily displaced when we’re adults. Literary giant George Bernard Shaw wrote, “Imitation is not just the sincerest form of flattery - it's the sincerest form of learning.” And British statesman Lord Chesterfield once said, “We are, in truth, more than half what we are by imitation.” Even if these ideas were only half-true, they’d still be a powerful lesson on who you choose to spend your time with, and how you choose to act. If you learned anything by watching me today, hopefully it involved the limitations of classical and operant conditioning, the basics of cognitive, observational, and social learning, a look

at mirror neurons, and how to beat up a Bobo doll. Thanks for watching, especially to all of our Subbable subscribers, who make this whole channel possible.

- [00:00] It’s 1961.
- [00:01] You’re wandering around Stanford University, looking for a sandwich or something when you
- [00:05] happen to walk by a particular room in a particular lab, and see something a little unnerving.
- [00:10] Namely, you find a woman punching an inflatable clown named Bobo in the neck.
- [00:17] Over and over in its neck.
- [00:19] This was the lab of legendary psychologist Albert Bandura, and in 1961 he was studying
- [00:25] one of the most important phenomena in psychology.
- [00:29] See, while the woman was throttling that big inflatable clown, there was a child watching
- [00:34] her.
- [00:35] And after about ten minutes of observing this clown-beating display, the kid was taken to
- [00:40] a room full of fun toys, which were soon taken away, and then the frustrated kid was left
- [00:45] alone with Bobo, and Bandura watched what happened.
- [00:48] And yeah, what happened was kind of scary.
- [00:51] Kids who watched the woman beating the clown were much more likely to mimic her aggression
- [00:55] -- kicking, punching, throwing, even attempting to maul Bobo with a hammer.
- [00:59] But other children who saw an adult playing nicely with the doll, or just ignoring it,

### Transcript (reading)

Clive Wearing was playing the piano alone in his room. When his wife came into the room, he immediately leapt up and embraced her with joyful enthusiasm. A minute later, she slipped out to grab a glass of water, and when she returned, he gave her that same bright greeting, as if she’d been gone for days. And then he did again. And again. Clive was an accomplished London musician, until, in 1985 at the age 47, he contracted a rare Herpes encephalitis virus that ravaged his central nervous system. Since then he’s been unable to remember almost any of his past, or to make any new memories. His wife is the only person he recognizes, but he can never recall the last time he saw her.

This may be the most profound case of extreme and chronic amnesia ever recorded. Our memory helps make us who we are. Whether recognizing loved ones, recalling past joys, or just remembering how to, like, walk and talk and fry an egg, memory is the chain that connects our past to our present. If it breaks, we’re left untethered, incapable of leaving the present moment, and unable to embrace the future. But memory isn’t an all or nothing thing, of course. Wearing can’t remember any details about his personal past, but he still remembers how to speak English, get dressed, and play the piano. Some memories you process automatically, and they are stored differently than your more personal or factual memories, like, your first kiss, or how to recite pi to twelve places,

or who won the Peloponnesian War. Speaking of ancient Greeks -- and to help demonstrate what I’m talking about -- I want you to have a look at our Spartan friend here, and remember his name. ‘Cause we’re gonna test your memory in just minute. [INTRO] Technically, memory is learning that has persisted over time -- information that has been stored and, in many cases, can be recalled. Except of course during the exam! Our memories are typically accessed in three different ways — through recall, recognition, and relearning. And if you think about all the different kinds of tests you’ve taken in school, they’re all actually designed to size up how you access stored information in these ways.

Like, recall is how you reach back in your mind and bring up information, just as you do in fill-in-the-blank tests. So if i say, BLANK is the capital of Greece, your brain would hopefully recall the answer as Athens. Recognition, meanwhile, is more like a multiple-choice test -- you only need identify old information when presented with it. As in: which of the following was NOT an ancient city in Greece: Athens, Marathon, Pompeii, or Sparta. And relearning is sort of like refreshing or reinforcing old information. So when you study for a final exam, you relearn things you half-forgot more easily than you did when you were first learning them, like, say, a basic timeline of the Greek empire.

But how? How does all of that data that we’re exposed to, all the time, every day, become memory? Well, in the late 1960s, American psychologists Richard Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin figured out enough about the process of memory-formation to break it down into three stages: First, it’s first encoded into brain, then stored for future use, and then eventually retrieved. Sounds simple, but by now you’ve figured out that, just because you take a lot of stuff about your mind for granted, that doesn’t mean it isn’t complicated. By Atkinson and Shiffrin’s model, we first record things we want to remember as an immediate, but fleeting, sensory memory. Think back to the image I showed you a minute ago.

Do you remember his name? If you do it’s because you successfully managed to shuffle it into your short-term memory, where you probably encoded it through rehearsal. This is how you briefly remember something like a password or phone number-- hey Tommy, what’s Jenny’s number? Okay. 867-5309...867-5309… 8-6-7-5-3… see you’re getting it in your head there. Or in this case, I told you to remember that guy’s name, so maybe you were thinking “Leonidas” repeatedly over and over, even if you didn’t think you were doing it. But this information really only stays in your short-term memory for under thirty seconds without a lot of rehearsal. So if you weren’t repeating “Leonidas,” you’d probably have forgotten it already.

Because your mind, amazing as it is, can really only hold between four to seven distinct bits of information at a time--at which point, the memory either decays, or gets transferred into long-term memory. Long-term memory is like your brain’s durable and ridiculously spacious storage unit, holding all your knowledge, skills, and experiences. Now, since the days of Atkinson and Shiffrin, psychologists have recognized that the classical definition of short-term memory didn’t really capture all of the processes involved in the transfer of information to your long-term memory. I mean, it’s more than just being able to remember some Greek guy’s name. So later generations of psychologists revisited the whole idea of short-term memory and updated

it to the more comprehensive concept of working memory. Working memory involves all the ways that we take short-term information and stash it in our long-term stores. And increasingly, we think of it as involving both explicit and implicit processes. When we store information consciously and actively, that’s an explicit process. We make the most of this aspect of working memory when we study, for instance, so that we can know that Athens is the capital of Greece, and that Pompeii was a Roman town, and not a Greek one. This is how we capture facts and knowledge that we think we’re going to need -- like I told you specifically to remember Leonidas’ name, you concentrated on that detail and filed it away, if briefly.

But of course we’re not conscious of Every. Tiny. Thing that we take in. Yet, our working memory often transfers stuff we’re not aware of to long-term storage. We call that an implicit process, the kind you don’t have to actively concentrate on. A good example might be classically conditioned associations, like, if you get all sweaty and nervous at the dentist because you had a root canal last year. You don’t need to pull up that file on the last time you got your face drilled to think oh hey, oral surgery! Not my favorite! Instead, implicit processes cover all that stuff automatically. This kind of automatic processing is hard to shut off-- unless you’ve got something unusual going on in your brain, you may not have much choice but to learn this way, like

how you learned how to not put your hand into a fire. That learning would have happened pretty much automatically as soon as you first yanked your hand away from an open flame. Whether things are lodged in there explicitly or implicitly, or both, there are also different kinds of long-term memory. For instance, procedural memory refers to how we remember to do things -- like riding a bike or reading - it’s effortful to learn at first, but eventually you can do it without thinking about it. Long-term memory can also be episodic, tied to specific episodes of your life -- like “remember that time that Bernice fell out of her chair in chemistry lab and started laughing uncontrollably?” Man, good times.

There are other types of long-term memory, too, and we’re continually learning more about the biology and psychology of the whole complex phenomenon. For instance, while Clive Wearing’s episodic memories (among others) seem to be deeply affected, his procedural memories for things seems to be in one piece. This has to do with neuroanatomy that we don’t have time to explore here, and that we don’t yet fully understand -- Wearing and others have a lot to teach us about the different types of long-term memory storage. Now, for healthy memories, there are lots of little tricks you can use to help remember information. Mnemonics, for one, help with memorization, and I’m sure you know a few that take the form of acronyms--ROY G. BIV for the colors of the rainbow, for instance.

Mnemonics work in part by organizing items into familiar, manageable units, in a process called chunking. For example, it may be hard to recall a seven-digit number, but it’ll be easier to commit it to memory in the rhythm of a phone number: 867-5309. Or you could just, you know, write a song about it. Strategies like mnemonics and chunking can help you with explicit processing, but how well you retain your data can depend on how deep you dig through the different levels of processing. Shallow processing, for instance, lets you encode information on really basic auditory or visual levels, based on the sound, structure or appearance of a word. So if you’re trying to commit the name Leonidas to your explicit memory, using shallow processing

you might encode the word by recalling the cool font you saw it in. But to really retain that information, you’d want to activate your deep processing, which encodes semantically, based on actual meaning associated with the word. In this case, you might remember the story of the mega-tough yet very scantily clad warrior of ancient Greece. Or you might remember that “leon” means “lion” in Greek, that lions are tough fighters, and that Leonidas was a tough Spartan warrior-king. And then to really, really make it stick, you want to connect it to something meaningful or related to your own personal, emotional experience. Like maybe Gerard Butler’s bronzed eight-pack torso and unconquerable blood-lust helped lock down the words Spartan and Leonidas in your forever memory.

I mean, maybe. If … if that helps you. In the end, how much information you encode and remember depends on both the time you took to learn it and how you made it personally relevant to YOU. Memory is extremely powerful. It’s constantly shaping and reshaping your brain, your life, and your identity. Clive Wearing is still himself on the outside, but in his inability to recall who he was, or process what has happened, he has lost some critically important part of himself. Our memories may haunt us or sustain us, but either way, they define us. Without them, we are left to wander alone in the dark. If you were committing this lesson to memory, you learned about how we encode and store memory, the difference between implicit automatic and effortful explicit processing, how shallow

and deep processing work, and a few types of long-term storage. Thanks for watching, especially to our Subbable subscribers, who make this whole channel possible.

### Transcript (navigation)

- [00:00] Clive Wearing was playing the piano alone in his room.
- [00:04] When his wife came into the room, he immediately leapt up and embraced her with joyful enthusiasm.
- [00:09] A minute later, she slipped out to grab a glass of water, and when she returned, he
- [00:13] gave her that same bright greeting, as if she’d been gone for days.
- [00:17] And then he did again.
- [00:19] And again.
- [00:20] Clive was an accomplished London musician, until, in 1985 at the age 47, he contracted
- [00:25] a rare Herpes encephalitis virus that ravaged his central nervous system.
- [00:30] Since then he’s been unable to remember almost any of his past, or to make any new
- [00:36] memories.
- [00:37] His wife is the only person he recognizes, but he can never recall the last time he saw
- [00:40] her.
- [00:41] This may be the most profound case of extreme and chronic amnesia ever recorded.
- [00:46] Our memory helps make us who we are.
- [00:48] Whether recognizing loved ones, recalling past joys, or just remembering how to, like,
- [00:53] walk and talk and fry an egg, memory is the chain that connects our past to our present.
- [00:58] If it breaks, we’re left untethered, incapable of leaving the present moment, and unable
- [01:04] to embrace the future.
- [01:05] But memory isn’t an all or nothing thing, of course.
- [01:09] Wearing can’t remember any details about his personal past, but he still remembers
- [01:12] how to speak English, get dressed, and play the piano.
- [01:15] Some memories you process automatically, and they are stored differently than your more
- [01:19] personal or factual memories, like, your first kiss, or how to recite pi to twelve places,
- [01:23] or who won the Peloponnesian War.
- [01:25] Speaking of ancient Greeks -- and to help demonstrate what I’m talking about -- I
- [01:28] want you to have a look at our Spartan friend here, and remember his name.
- [01:32] ‘Cause we’re gonna test your memory in just minute.
- [01:38] [INTRO]
- [01:42] Technically, memory is learning that has persisted over time -- information that has been stored
- [01:50] and, in many cases, can be recalled.
- [01:52] Except of course during the exam!
- [01:54] Our memories are typically accessed in three different ways — through recall, recognition,
- [01:59] and relearning.
- [02:00] And if you think about all the different kinds of tests you’ve taken in school, they’re
- [02:04] all actually designed to size up how you access stored information in these ways.
- [02:08] Like, recall is how you reach back in your mind and bring up information, just as you
- [02:13] do in fill-in-the-blank tests.
- [02:14] So if i say, BLANK is the capital of Greece, your brain would hopefully recall the answer
- [02:19] as Athens.
- [02:20] Recognition, meanwhile, is more like a multiple-choice test -- you only need identify old information
- [02:25] when presented with it.
- [02:27] As in: which of the following was NOT an ancient city in Greece: Athens, Marathon, Pompeii,
- [02:33] or Sparta.
- [02:34] And relearning is sort of like refreshing or reinforcing old information.
- [02:38] So when you study for a final exam, you relearn things you half-forgot more easily than you
- [02:43] did when you were first learning them, like, say, a basic timeline of the Greek empire.
- [02:48] But how?
- [02:49] How does all of that data that we’re exposed to, all the time, every day, become memory?
- [02:54] Well, in the late 1960s, American psychologists Richard Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin figured
- [02:59] out enough about the process of memory-formation to break it down into three stages:
- [03:03] First, it’s first encoded into brain, then stored for future use, and then eventually
- [03:07] retrieved.
- [03:09] Sounds simple, but by now you’ve figured out that, just because you take a lot of stuff
- [03:12] about your mind for granted, that doesn’t mean it isn’t complicated.
- [03:15] By Atkinson and Shiffrin’s model, we first record things we want to remember as an immediate,
- [03:20] but fleeting, sensory memory.
- [03:23] Think back to the image I showed you a minute ago.
- [03:24] Do you remember his name?
- [03:25] If you do it’s because you successfully managed to shuffle it into your short-term
- [03:30] memory, where you probably encoded it through rehearsal.
- [03:33] This is how you briefly remember something like a password or phone number-- hey Tommy,
- [03:37] what’s Jenny’s number?
- [03:38] Okay.
- [03:39] 867-5309...867-5309… 8-6-7-5-3… see you’re getting it in your head there.
- [03:47] Or in this case, I told you to remember that guy’s name, so maybe you were thinking “Leonidas”
- [03:52] repeatedly over and over, even if you didn’t think you were doing it.
- [03:54] But this information really only stays in your short-term memory for under thirty seconds
- [03:58] without a lot of rehearsal.
- [04:00] So if you weren’t repeating “Leonidas,” you’d probably have
- [04:03] forgotten it already.
- [04:04] Because your mind, amazing as it is, can really only hold between four to seven distinct bits
- [04:09] of information at a time--at which point, the memory either decays, or gets transferred
- [04:14] into long-term memory.
- [04:16] Long-term memory is like your brain’s durable and ridiculously spacious storage unit, holding
- [04:21] all your knowledge, skills, and experiences.
- [04:24] Now, since the days of Atkinson and Shiffrin, psychologists have recognized that the classical
- [04:28] definition of short-term memory didn’t really capture all of the processes involved in the
- [04:33] transfer of information to your long-term memory.
- [04:35] I mean, it’s more than just being able to remember some Greek guy’s name.
- [04:38] So later generations of psychologists revisited the whole idea of short-term memory and updated
- [04:43] it to the more comprehensive concept of working memory.
- [04:46] Working memory involves all the ways that we take short-term information and stash it
- [04:51] in our long-term stores.
- [04:52] And increasingly, we think of it as involving both explicit and implicit processes.
- [04:56] When we store information consciously and actively, that’s an explicit process.
- [05:01] We make the most of this aspect of working memory when we study, for instance, so that
- [05:05] we can know that Athens is the capital of Greece, and that Pompeii was a Roman town,
- [05:08] and not a Greek one.
- [05:09] This is how we capture facts and knowledge that we think we’re going to need -- like
- [05:13] I told you specifically to remember Leonidas’ name, you concentrated on that detail and
- [05:18] filed it away, if briefly.
- [05:20] But of course we’re not conscious of Every.
- [05:21] Tiny.
- [05:22] Thing that we take in.
- [05:23] Yet, our working memory often transfers stuff we’re not aware of to long-term storage.
- [05:29] We call that an implicit process, the kind you don’t have to actively concentrate on.
- [05:33] A good example might be classically conditioned associations, like, if you get all sweaty
- [05:37] and nervous at the dentist because you had a root canal last year.
- [05:39] You don’t need to pull up that file on the last time you got your face drilled to think
- [05:44] oh hey, oral surgery!
- [05:45] Not my favorite!
- [05:47] Instead, implicit processes cover all that stuff automatically.
- [05:49] This kind of automatic processing is hard to shut off-- unless you’ve got something
- [05:53] unusual going on in your brain, you may not have much choice but to learn this way, like
- [05:58] how you learned how to not put your hand into a fire.
- [06:01] That learning would have happened pretty much automatically as soon as you first yanked
- [06:04] your hand away from an open flame.
- [06:05] Whether things are lodged in there explicitly or implicitly, or both, there are also different
- [06:10] kinds of long-term memory.
- [06:12] For instance, procedural memory refers to how we remember to do things -- like riding
- [06:16] a bike or reading - it’s effortful to learn at first, but eventually you can do it without
- [06:21] thinking about it.
- [06:22] Long-term memory can also be episodic, tied to specific episodes of your life -- like
- [06:27] “remember that time that Bernice fell out of her chair in chemistry lab and started
- [06:30] laughing uncontrollably?”
- [06:31] Man, good times.
- [06:32] There are other types of long-term memory, too, and we’re continually learning more
- [06:36] about the biology and psychology of the whole complex phenomenon.
- [06:40] For instance, while Clive Wearing’s episodic memories (among others) seem to be deeply
- [06:45] affected, his procedural memories for things seems to be in one piece.
- [06:49] This has to do with neuroanatomy that we don’t have time to explore here, and that we don’t
- [06:53] yet fully understand -- Wearing and others have a lot to teach us about the different
- [06:57] types of long-term memory storage.
- [06:59] Now, for healthy memories, there are lots of little tricks you can use to help remember
- [07:02] information.
- [07:03] Mnemonics, for one, help with memorization, and I’m sure you know a few that take the
- [07:07] form of acronyms--ROY G. BIV for the colors of the rainbow, for instance.
- [07:11] Mnemonics work in part by organizing items into familiar, manageable units, in a process
- [07:16] called chunking.
- [07:17] For example, it may be hard to recall a seven-digit number, but it’ll be easier to commit it
- [07:22] to memory in the rhythm of a phone number: 867-5309.
- [07:24] Or you could just, you know, write a song about it.
- [07:28] Strategies like mnemonics and chunking can help you with explicit processing, but how
- [07:32] well you retain your data can depend on how deep you dig through the different levels
- [07:37] of processing.
- [07:38] Shallow processing, for instance, lets you encode information on really basic auditory
- [07:42] or visual levels, based on the sound, structure or appearance of a word.
- [07:46] So if you’re trying to commit the name Leonidas to your explicit memory, using shallow processing
- [07:51] you might encode the word by recalling the cool font you saw it in.
- [07:54] But to really retain that information, you’d want to activate your deep processing, which
- [07:59] encodes semantically, based on actual meaning associated with the word.
- [08:04] In this case, you might remember the story of the mega-tough yet very scantily clad warrior
- [08:09] of ancient Greece.
- [08:10] Or you might remember that “leon” means “lion” in Greek, that lions are tough
- [08:14] fighters, and that Leonidas was a tough Spartan warrior-king.
- [08:18] And then to really, really make it stick, you want to connect it to something meaningful

### Transcript (reading)

It was midnight when Bernice got off work. She was exhausted after a long and terrible day, and just wanted to get home to a hot bath. She was driving down the street, flipping through radio stations, when she pulled up to a stop sign, and saw something weird. A shadowy figure ran up to an idling fruit truck, pushed the delivery man down, grabbed a crate of bananas, and ran off around the corner. Bernice was pretty shaken up, but she made sure the driver was okay, and then called the police, describing the thief as a pale, lanky man, wearing a dark jacket and a baseball cap. She gave the cops her information, and then she went home. A couple days later the police asked her to come down to the station to identify a potential

thief--a guy who more or less matched her description, and was found eating a banana early that morning, near the scene of the crime. Although the guy professed innocence, Bernice said it was him, and they locked him up. But at the trial, the defense called a memory expert to the stand, and soon after that, the suspect walked. Today’s lesson may not quite make you an expert worthy of the witness stand, but by the time we’re done, you’ll understand a lot more about how we retrieve memories we think we’ve stored, and why the accused banana thief was set free. [INTRO] We’re all constantly retrieving memories throughout the day-- you’re remembering where you parked your car, or if you fed the cat, or called your mom ‘cause it’s her birthday.

You’ll remember from last week that while our implicit memories--like how to talk and ride a bike--are dealt with on a mostly automatic and non-conscious level, our explicit memories--the chronicles of our personal experiences and general knowledge -- often require conscious, effortful work. Bernice had to notice, encode, store, and later consciously retrieve details about the crime she witnessed--what color was the guy’s jacket, what did he look like, what did he steal, and where did he run? It takes a lot of work to retrieve memories from long-term storage, and the truth is, a lot can go wrong along the way. In order to understand all of the many fascinating ways you forget things, we need to talk more about how we remember.

Our memories are not like books in the library of your mind. You don’t just pluck a neatly-packaged memory -- about where you left your phone or the hair color of a fruit thief. Instead your memories are more like the spider webs in the dank catacombs of your mind--a series of interconnected associations that link all sorts of diverse things, as bits of information get stuck to other bits of information. Like, maybe Bernice remembers that the night of the crime was chilly with a full moon, and that Beyonce was on the radio, and the fruit truck had plates from California, which is where her grandfather lives. All those bits of information in the web of memory--the weather, the song, the plates--can serve as retrieval cues, kind of like a trail of breadcrumbs leading back to a particular

memory. The more retrieval cues you inadvertently, or intentionally, build along the way, the better you can backtrack and find the memory you’re looking for. This way of activating associations non-consciously is called priming, sometimes called “memoryless memory”. It’s how “invisible memories” that you didn’t know you had can awaken old associations. Priming is how you often jog your memory. This kind of recall is sometimes referred to as context-dependent memory. Say you’re reading in bed, and you want to underline a quote, but you don’t have a pen. You get up and go into the other room to find your special light-up Hello Kitty pen, but you get distracted and suddenly you find yourself in the kitchen; you’re like “Why?

Why, mind? Why am I in the kitchen? What is here? Why am- there was a rea- and I don’t know but I’m here now and agh!” It’s only when you retrace your steps and return to bed, to the initial context where you read that quote and encoded that first thought of wanting that pen, that the memory comes back. And then you’re like ‘oh, I need to go get the pen. Ugh’ If some memories are context-dependent, others are state-dependent, and also mood-congruent. This just means that our states and our emotions can also serve as retrieval cues. If I had a throbbing headache and a super bad day, I’m more likely to start recalling bad memories, because I’m priming negative associations.

But of course if I’m relaxed and jolly, I’m prone to remember happy times, which are prolonging my good mood. Another funny memory-retrieval quirk speaks not to our location or emotions, but to the order in which we receive new information. So, say you make a grocery list in the morning, but a few hours later, you’re at the store, you realize you left it at home. You’d be more likely to recall the first items on the list--bananas and bread--and the last items--pickles and cheese--than anything in the middle. This is known as the serial position effect. This might be because the early words benefitted from what’s known as the primacy effect, and made it into your long-term memory because they were rehearsed more.

Meanwhile, the last words lingered in the working memory through the recency effect. But those poor middle words, they didn’t benefit from either effect and therefore escaped your brain, which is why you now have no toilet paper, dog food, toothpaste, or cookies. Who forgets cookies? But even with all these tricks and associations, things still go wrong--memory can fail or become distorted, and of course we forget things. Forgetfulness can be as minor as those frustrating moments where you’re like ‘Ah, it’s on the tip of my tongue. It’s the guy, the guy’s got hair, and a face, and, like, shoulders.’ Or as major as Clive Wearing, whose neurological damage made it impossible for him to recall the past or create new memories.

Of course, we all forget things, and typically we do it in one of three different ways: We fail to encode it, we fail to retrieve it, or we experience what psychologists call storage decay. Sometimes forgetting something just means it never really got through your encoding process in the first place. I mean, think of all the stuff that’s going around you at any given moment. We only actually notice a fraction of what we sense, and we can only consciously hold so many bits of information in our minds at any given time, so what we fail to notice, we tend to not encode, and thus don't remember. Bernice noticed a dark jacket, Beyonce, and bananas, but she didn’t encode much about the driver, or the color of the thief’s shoes.

Then again, even memories that have been encoded are still vulnerable to storage decay, or natural forgetting over time. Interestingly, even though we can forget things pretty quickly, the amount of data that we forget can actually levels off after a while. This means that Bernice would have forgotten about half of what she first noticed from the crime scene a couple days later, but what she still remembered, she’d likely hang on to, because the rate at which we forget tends to plateau. A lot of times forgetting doesn’t mean our memory just faded to black, it means we can’t call it up on demand because of retrieval failure. We all know the common tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon where you feel like you know the name of that weird-looking hard-backed animal that rolls up into ball.

It’s kind of cute and weird and I think they get leprosy or something…what is it?! This is where retrieval cues can come in handy. If I say is starts with the letter A, you may suddenly unlock the information--Armadillo! Sometimes these retrieval problems stem from interference from other memories getting in the way, essentially cluttering the brain. Sometimes, old stuff that you’ve learned keeps you from recalling new stuff -- like, if you change one of your passwords, but keep recalling your old one every time you try to log in. That’s called proactive, or forward-acting, interference. The flip side is retroactive, or backward-acting, interference, which happens when new learning gets in the way of recalling old information, like if you start studying Spanish, it may

interfere with the French that you’ve already learned. There’s a lot of reconstruction and inferring involved when you try to flesh out a memory, and every time you replay it in your mind, or relate it to a friend, it changes, just a little. So in a way, we’re all sort of perpetually re-writing our pasts. While this is an inevitable part of human nature, it can prove dangerous at times. Misleading information can get incorporated into a memory, and twist the truth - and yes there is an effect for this; it’s called the misinformation effect. American psychologist and memory expert Elizabeth Loftus has spent decades showing how eyewitnesses inadvertently tweak and reconstruct their memories after accidents or crimes.

In one experiment, two groups watched a film of a car accident. Those asked how fast the cars were going when they smashed into each other estimated much higher speeds than those who were asked about the cars hitting each other. Smash is the leading word that essentially altered the witnesses’ memories -- so much so that a week later, when both groups were asked if they saw any broken glass, those who heard the word smash were twice as likely to report seeing bits of glass, when in fact, the original film didn’t show any. In Bernice’s case, chances are her memory of the robbery would be altered if the prosecution said the thief assaulted, rather than pushed the driver. This sort of interfering or misleading information may also manifest itself as source misattribution,

like when we forget or misrecall the source of a memory. In the case of Bernice, when she saw the suspect in the courtroom, she thought she recognized him from the night of the crime, when in reality, he’d just served her coffee earlier that day. But her memory of the event had probably already been tweaked several times before she even made it into the courtroom. Like she re-lived the tale multiple times, in her own mind or when she told other people about it, and every time she introduced errors, filling in memory gaps with reasonable guesses. Not only that, but we know Bernice was already tired and stressed when she witnessed the event, and we know our emotions can influence both what we remember and what we forget.

Because memory is both a reconstruction and a reproduction of past events, we can’t ever really be sure if a memory is real just because it feels real. Elizabeth Loftus knows this. She’s frequently called in to testify against the accuracy of eyewitnesses. In fact, of all the U.S. prisoners who have been exonerated based on DNA evidence presented by Innocence Project, a non-profit legal group, 75 percent of them were convicted by mistaken eyewitnesses. That is a lot of innocent people. Bernice meant well of course, she’s an honest enough lady, but all these factors--the emotion, the retelling, the suggestions of outside sources-- combined with the darkness, the quick glimpse, the passing of time, maybe even the Beyonce, ended up leading to a mistake in the thief’s identification.

Turns out the human memory is actually a very fragile thing. We’re all largely the product of the stories that we tell ourselves. If you haven’t forgotten already, today you learned about how our memories are stored in webs of association, aided by retrieval cues and priming, and influenced by context and mood. You also learned how we forget information, how our memories are susceptible to interference and misinformation, and why eyewitnesses are often not as reliable as you might think.

- [00:58] we think we’ve stored, and why the accused banana thief was set free.
- [01:05] [INTRO]
- [01:09] We’re all constantly retrieving memories throughout the day-- you’re remembering
- [01:16] where you parked your car, or if you fed the cat, or called your mom ‘cause it’s her
- [01:20] birthday.
- [01:21] You’ll remember from last week that while our implicit memories--like how to talk and
- [01:23] ride a bike--are dealt with on a mostly automatic and non-conscious level, our explicit memories--the
- [01:29] chronicles of our personal experiences and general knowledge -- often require conscious,
- [01:34] effortful work.
- [01:35] Bernice had to notice, encode, store, and later consciously retrieve details about the
- [01:41] crime she witnessed--what color was the guy’s jacket, what did he look like, what did he
- [01:45] steal, and where did he run?
- [01:46] It takes a lot of work to retrieve memories from long-term storage, and the truth is,
- [01:50] a lot can go wrong along the way.
- [01:52] In order to understand all of the many fascinating ways you forget things, we need to talk more
- [01:57] about how we remember.
- [01:59] Our memories are not like books in the library of your mind.
- [02:02] You don’t just pluck a neatly-packaged memory -- about where you left your phone or the
- [02:06] hair color of a fruit thief.
- [02:08] Instead your memories are more like the spider webs in the dank catacombs of your mind--a
- [02:13] series of interconnected associations that link all sorts of diverse things, as bits
- [02:17] of information get stuck to other bits of information.
- [02:20] Like, maybe Bernice remembers that the night of the crime was chilly with a full moon,
- [02:24] and that Beyonce was on the radio, and the fruit truck had plates from California, which
- [02:27] is where her grandfather lives.
- [02:29] All those bits of information in the web of memory--the weather, the song, the plates--can
- [02:34] serve as retrieval cues, kind of like a trail of breadcrumbs leading back to a particular
- [02:39] memory.
- [02:40] The more retrieval cues you inadvertently, or intentionally, build along the way, the
- [02:43] better you can backtrack and find the memory you’re looking for.
- [02:46] This way of activating associations non-consciously is called priming, sometimes called “memoryless
- [02:51] memory”.
- [02:52] It’s how “invisible memories” that you didn’t know you had can awaken old associations.
- [02:56] Priming is how you often jog your memory.
- [02:59] This kind of recall is sometimes referred to as context-dependent memory.
- [03:02] Say you’re reading in bed, and you want to underline a quote, but you don’t have
- [03:05] a pen.
- [03:06] You get up and go into the other room to find your special light-up Hello Kitty pen, but
- [03:09] you get distracted and suddenly you find yourself in the kitchen; you’re like “Why?
- [03:13] Why, mind?
- [03:14] Why am I in the kitchen?
- [03:15] What is here?
- [03:16] Why am- there was a rea- and I don’t know but I’m here now and agh!”
- [03:19] It’s only when you retrace your steps and return to bed, to the initial context where
- [03:23] you read that quote and encoded that first thought of wanting that pen, that the memory
- [03:27] comes back.
- [03:28] And then you’re like ‘oh, I need to go get the pen.
- [03:31] Ugh’ If some memories are context-dependent, others
- [03:34] are state-dependent, and also mood-congruent.
- [03:37] This just means that our states and our emotions can also serve as retrieval cues.
- [03:40] If I had a throbbing headache and a super bad day, I’m more likely to start recalling
- [03:44] bad memories, because I’m priming negative associations.
- [03:48] But of course if I’m relaxed and jolly, I’m prone to remember happy times, which
- [03:51] are prolonging my good mood.
- [03:53] Another funny memory-retrieval quirk speaks not to our location or emotions, but to the
- [03:57] order in which we receive new information.
- [04:00] So, say you make a grocery list in the morning, but a few hours later, you’re at the store,
- [04:03] you realize you left it at home.
- [04:05] You’d be more likely to recall the first items on the list--bananas and bread--and
- [04:08] the last items--pickles and cheese--than anything in the middle.
- [04:11] This is known as the serial position effect.
- [04:14] This might be because the early words benefitted from what’s known as the primacy effect,
- [04:17] and made it into your long-term memory because they were rehearsed more.
- [04:21] Meanwhile, the last words lingered in the working memory through the recency effect.
- [04:25] But those poor middle words, they didn’t benefit from either effect and therefore escaped
- [04:29] your brain, which is why you now have no toilet paper, dog food, toothpaste, or cookies.
- [04:34] Who forgets cookies?
- [04:35] But even with all these tricks and associations, things still go wrong--memory can fail or
- [04:41] become distorted, and of course we forget things.
- [04:44] Forgetfulness can be as minor as those frustrating moments where you’re like ‘Ah, it’s
- [04:47] on the tip of my tongue.
- [04:48] It’s the guy, the guy’s got hair, and a face, and, like, shoulders.’
- [04:52] Or as major as Clive Wearing, whose neurological damage made it impossible for him to recall
- [04:56] the past or create new memories.
- [04:58] Of course, we all forget things, and typically we do it in one of three different ways: We
- [05:03] fail to encode it, we fail to retrieve it, or we experience what psychologists call storage
- [05:08] decay.
- [05:09] Sometimes forgetting something just means it never really got through your encoding
- [05:12] process in the first place.
- [05:13] I mean, think of all the stuff that’s going around you at any given moment.
- [05:17] We only actually notice a fraction of what we sense, and we can only consciously hold
- [05:21] so many bits of information in our minds at any given time, so what we fail to notice,
- [05:25] we tend to not encode, and thus don't remember.
- [05:28] Bernice noticed a dark jacket, Beyonce, and bananas, but she didn’t encode much about
- [05:33] the driver, or the color of the thief’s shoes.
- [05:35] Then again, even memories that have been encoded are still vulnerable to storage decay, or
- [05:39] natural forgetting over time.
- [05:41] Interestingly, even though we can forget things pretty quickly, the amount of data that we
- [05:45] forget can actually levels off after a while.
- [05:47] This means that Bernice would have forgotten about half of what she first noticed from
- [05:50] the crime scene a couple days later, but what she still remembered, she’d likely hang
- [05:54] on to, because the rate at which we forget tends to plateau.
- [05:57] A lot of times forgetting doesn’t mean our memory just faded to black, it means we can’t
- [06:01] call it up on demand because of retrieval failure.
- [06:04] We all know the common tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon where you feel like you know the name of that
- [06:08] weird-looking hard-backed animal that rolls up into ball.
- [06:12] It’s kind of cute and weird and I think they get leprosy or something…what is it?!
- [06:16] This is where retrieval cues can come in handy.
- [06:18] If I say is starts with the letter A, you may suddenly unlock the information--Armadillo!
- [06:22] Sometimes these retrieval problems stem from interference from other memories getting in
- [06:26] the way, essentially cluttering the brain.
- [06:28] Sometimes, old stuff that you’ve learned keeps you from recalling new stuff -- like,
- [06:31] if you change one of your passwords, but keep recalling your old one every time you try
- [06:35] to log in.
- [06:36] That’s called proactive, or forward-acting, interference.
- [06:38] The flip side is retroactive, or backward-acting, interference, which happens when new learning
- [06:43] gets in the way of recalling old information, like if you start studying Spanish, it may
- [06:47] interfere with the French that you’ve already learned.
- [06:49] There’s a lot of reconstruction and inferring involved when you try to flesh out a memory,
- [06:54] and every time you replay it in your mind, or relate it to a friend, it changes, just
- [06:58] a little.
- [06:59] So in a way, we’re all sort of perpetually re-writing our pasts.
- [07:03] While this is an inevitable part of human nature, it can prove dangerous at times.
- [07:08] Misleading information can get incorporated into a memory, and twist the truth - and yes
- [07:11] there is an effect for this; it’s called the misinformation effect.
- [07:14] American psychologist and memory expert Elizabeth Loftus has spent decades showing how eyewitnesses
- [07:19] inadvertently tweak and reconstruct their memories after accidents or crimes.
- [07:23] In one experiment, two groups watched a film of a car accident.
- [07:26] Those asked how fast the cars were going when they smashed into each other estimated much
- [07:30] higher speeds than those who were asked about the cars hitting each other.
- [07:35] Smash is the leading word that essentially altered the witnesses’ memories -- so much
- [07:39] so that a week later, when both groups were asked if they saw any broken glass, those
- [07:44] who heard the word smash were twice as likely to report seeing bits of glass, when in fact,
- [07:49] the original film didn’t show any.
- [07:50] In Bernice’s case, chances are her memory of the robbery would be altered if the prosecution
- [07:54] said the thief assaulted, rather than pushed the driver.
- [07:57] This sort of interfering or misleading information may also manifest itself as source misattribution,
- [08:02] like when we forget or misrecall the source of a memory.
- [08:05] In the case of Bernice, when she saw the suspect in the courtroom, she thought she recognized
- [08:09] him from the night of the crime, when in reality, he’d just served her coffee earlier that
- [08:13] day.
- [08:14] But her memory of the event had probably already been tweaked several times before she even
- [08:17] made it into the courtroom.
- [08:19] Like she re-lived the tale multiple times, in her own mind or when she told other people
- [08:23] about it, and every time she introduced errors, filling in memory gaps with reasonable guesses.
- [08:28] Not only that, but we know Bernice was already tired and stressed when she witnessed the
- [08:32] event, and we know our emotions can influence both what we remember and what we forget.
- [08:37] Because memory is both a reconstruction and a reproduction of past events, we can’t
- [08:41] ever really be sure if a memory is real just because it feels real.
- [08:45] Elizabeth Loftus knows this.
- [08:47] She’s frequently called in to testify against the accuracy of eyewitnesses.
- [08:50] In fact, of all the U.S. prisoners who have been exonerated based on DNA evidence presented
- [08:55] by Innocence Project, a non-profit legal group, 75 percent of them were convicted by mistaken
- [09:00] eyewitnesses.
- [09:01] That is a lot of innocent people.
- [09:03] Bernice meant well of course, she’s an honest enough lady, but all these factors--the emotion,
- [09:07] the retelling, the suggestions of outside sources-- combined with the darkness, the
- [09:11] quick glimpse, the passing of time, maybe even the Beyonce, ended up leading to a mistake
- [09:16] in the thief’s identification.
- [09:18] Turns out the human memory is actually a very fragile thing.
- [09:21] We’re all largely the product of the stories that we tell ourselves.
- [09:25] If you haven’t forgotten already, today you learned about how our memories are stored
- [09:29] in webs of association, aided by retrieval cues and priming, and influenced by context
- [09:34] and mood.
- [09:35] You also learned how we forget information, how our memories are susceptible to interference
- [09:40] and misinformation, and why eyewitnesses are often not as reliable as you might think.
