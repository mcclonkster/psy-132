### Transcript (reading)

Even though you can't see me, you know that I am here talking to you. And I can probably persuade you that this container of water and this container of water have the same amount of water, which they do, even though they don't look like they do. And you'll see I left my anglerfish behind me. If someone were to move it without my knowing, you'd rightly expect me to look for it first where I originally left it. ...Nnnugh!! You can figure out all these things because you are far down the path of cognitive development. Your parents will be proud. But there was a time in your life, in all our lives, when simple concepts like these were totally baffling. Of course, lots of things influence how your mind and its relationship with the world grows over time.

Both our genetics and our environment begin to affect our development long before we're even born, and they continue to influence our learning until the day we die. And even though we're born with nearly the same number of brain cells we'll ever have, our complete set of brain hardware takes years to solidify as our neural networks grow more complex. The study of our physical changes, cognitive, social and emotional changes throughout our whole lives - from prenatal to preteen to post-retirement - is called developmental psychology. It's how we grow into who we are. And it begins with the growth of knowledge itself: the process by which you mature into the anglerfish-tracking water-beaker-estimating peekaboo-master that you are today.

[Intro] As we age, we tend to follow a sequence of changes in behavior and appearance called maturation. Everyone is affected differently by their personal experience, of course, but we all share inherent genetic growth tendencies. We roll over before we sit, we sit before stand, and we stand before we walk, and we walk before we break dance. The same thing applies to our cognitive development - how we learn to think, know, remember and communicate. And if you're gonna talk about cognitive development, you gotta start with Jean Piaget, developmental psychologist extraordinaire. Piaget was from Switzerland where he was kind of a wunderkind and got his PhD in zoology in 1918, began dabbling in Freud psychoanalysis. After graduation, he headed to France to work

on a method for testing children's aptitudes and abilities. While administering these tests, Piaget began to notice how younger kids kept giving wrong answers to certain questions. He became fascinated by the fact that children of a certain age consistently made particular mistakes that older kids and adults didn't. Like the younger kids would have a really hard time understanding the idea I just showed you, that this container has the same amount of water in it as in this container. Or that this row of coins has the same number as this row. While others might have dismissed these as childish mistakes, Piaget theorized that it was because humans go through specific stages of cognitive development and intellectual progression. His main game was asking 'How does knowledge grow?'

He proposed that as we grow and struggle to make sense of our experiences, we create schemas, or mental frameworks that help interpret information. Schemas are like concepts, ranging from physical things like birds and hats and eye patches to abstract ideas like friendship and betrayal. And we're constantly striving for cognitive equilibrium, or harmony, between our thought processes and our environments, which are always giving us new things to think about and adjust to. Piaget proposed that we adapt to new experiences through two processes that are closely related - assimilation and accommodation. When we assimilate new experiences, we interpret them in terms of our existing schemas. So if a toddler has never seen a deer but has a schema for a horse, she may call the first

deer she sees a horsey. She wants to fit it within her understanding. But with more interactions in the world, our minds expand to accommodate, or adjust to new experiences. So soon enough, that kid realizes that deer aren't just horses, and she adjusts her schema. From there, she'll be able to tell the difference between Bambi and Black Beauty in no time. But our knowledge base grows in ways that are much more complex than just those two steps, and Piaget knew that. He went on to devise a four-stage theory of cognitive development that described how we learn in different phases of our lives. He called stage one the sensorimotor stage, which begins at birth and continues on to about age two. This is the time when babies experience the world through their senses

and actions. Touching and grabbing and looking and hearing. And putting things in their mouth. From what I can tell, mostly just putting things in their mouth. Younger babies may get scared around strangers, seem to live only in the present, and have to see something to know it exists. This makes them very easy to trick, if you're into that - I mean if you have any experience with babies, just think about this: toss a blanket over a six-month-old's pacifier and they think it vanished. They lack object permanence, the awareness that things still exist when they're out of sight. And yet, we develop so quickly that just a month or two later that baby already understands better that objects and people don't disappear just because they're hidden.

Object permanence, in Piaget's view, was one of the major achievements of the sensorimotor stage. The second of Piaget's phases of development is the 'preoperational stage' and he believed it began around age two, and carried on through age six or seven. The thing about kids of this age is that it's all about them. The preoperational stage is characterized by 'egocentrism' which drives most of what a child thinks and says. Kids have a hard time imagining another person's point of view, so much so that when I was a kid, if you asked me if I had a brother, I'd say, 'sure, John', but if you asked me if John had a brother I'd say, 'Nah, I don't think so.' Egocentrism of course never fully disappears, even in adults who understand how the whole sibling thing works.

The preoperational stage is also marked by a child's ability to mentally represent objects and events with words and images and pretend plays in their imagination. They're big into animism now, and believe their favorite bunny, batman or stuffed anglerfish has feelings and opinions and possibly the intent to kiss or kill you when you're asleep - depending on how they're feeling. Still plenty of kinks to work out. Piaget suggests that early in this stage, kids don't yet understand the concept of conservation - like how 500 milliliters is the same as 500 milliliters, no matter what container it's in. They can also struggle with the notion of reversibility. It's hard for them to mentally reverse the process by which a ball of clay smashed flat can be rolled back into a ball.

It's a concept that takes some time to understand. And these challenges both have to do with 'Centration' - a child's tendency to fixate on just one aspect of a problem or object - like the shape of the container or the clay. But during the second half of stage two, things begin to blossom. Kids start forming their theory of mind or ability to understand other people's feelings, thoughts and perceptions- as well as their own- and also how to predict behavior... like remember when my anglerfish got moved when I wasn't looking? A child at this stage will begin to realize that while she knows that the fish is in a new place, I don't know it was moved, so when I start to look for it, she'll expect me to look where it originally was and not where it was moved to.

These new people skills have all kinds of awesome applications from trying to convince your parents to "PLEASE GIVE ME THAT EXTRA COOKIE I SO DESPERATELY NEED!" to showing empathy, which is better - and offering comfort to others when they seem sad. Piaget called the third stage of development - beginning around age six or seven and lasting until eleven or twelve - the 'Concrete Operational Stage'. Kids are starting to think logically about concrete events that they've actually experienced. And unlike children in the earlier phase, getting hung up on issues of centration, kids in this stage experience 'decentration', and become able to see beyond just one aspect of an object or problem.

So now, problems with reversibility and conservation just cease to be problems. And the last of Piaget's four stages is the 'Formal Operational Stage' which starts at about twelve and carries us through the rest of our lives. By now, our reasoning is expanding to include more abstract thinking, problem solving and hypothetical questions. Now Piaget's four-stage model has been criticized for over-simplifying things and for being too rigid in how it classifies certain abilities by age. Today, for example, researchers have detected these phases at earlier ages than Piaget ever did - sometimes way earlier - like some types of object permanence have been observed in three-month-olds.

Psychologists also see development as more of a continuous process rather than a series of stepping stones. But even Piaget understood that his stages weren't as fixed as he made them sound. And he wasn't the only guy on the block talking about development. For instance, his contemporary, Belarussian psychologist Lev Vygotsky, had some ideas of his own. While Piaget focused on how a kid's mind grows by interacting with his physical environment, Vygotsky emphasized how early development occurs through parental instruction and interaction with social environments. He believed less in set stages and more in the idea that care-giver adults provide a sort of scaffolding, that helps children climb to higher levels of thinking and learning.

Vgotsky put a lot of emphasis on language as a way of assigning meaning to things, and he also suggested that the ways kids develop might actually vary across cultures. In the end, there's room for lots of different theories here, but perhaps Piaget's greatest achievement was developing theoretical depth in the concept that kids actually think very differently than adults. This fact has helped a lot of parents and teachers, and his work spurred a new era of research in the field. While Piaget wasn't the only developmentalist, or even the first, he's definitely one of the most influential, and remains relevant to this day. As the brain and mind develop in children, so too do their social, emotional, and moral

behavior. How a child is raised and cared for can have a profound impact on their personality later in life, which is something we'll look at next week. This week, though, you learned how we use schemas, assimilation, and accommodation to make sense of the world around us, and about Piaget's four-stage theory of cognitive development, including sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational periods, and about Vgotsky's theory of scaffolding.

### Transcript (reading)

So you’ve probably seen a little kid react to a sudden bang or a terrifying clown or some strange Santa at the mall, right? Yeah, not pretty. That child probably immediately reached for a parent, looking for comfort, and that same kid might freak out if she was separated from her adult of choice, especially is she was in an unfamiliar environment. It’s called attachment and if you’ve ever seen a clingy kid you know why it’s called that. They attach. For a long time psychologists assumed that this was just an intense innate survival instinct; I mean it makes sense that babies would be attached to their food source and bigger kids would stick around to the people who helped them survive.

But in the 1950s American psychologists Harry and Margaret Harlow came along with a barrel of monkeys, complicating and illuminating our idea of bonding with caregivers in what has to be one of the saddest psychological experiments of all time. The Harlow’s were breeding Rhesus macaque monkeys for their research on learning. Part of the process involved separating babies from their mothers right after birth, which, yeah, pretty cruel already. They began noticing that baby monkeys were very attached to the blankets they had in their cages, so they set up an experiment. They created two artificial mothers. One was a bare wire cylinder with a feeding bottle attached; they called that Wire Mother, and the other was a cozier cloth and foam wrapped cylinder without a feeding bottle:

Cloth Mother. It took no time at all to see the baby’s preference. They overwhelming preferred the comfy cloth mama, clinging to it whenever they seemed to be anxious or in need of comfort, and sometimes they fed from the Wire Mother with the baby bottle while standing on the cloth one. This discovery that attachment wasn’t just about getting breakfast surprised a lot of people. It turns out that contact and touch are vital to attachment, learning, emotional well-being, and psychological development. As the brain and mind develop in infants so too do they’re emotions and social behavior. Caregivers can greatly influence this development, and most psychologists will tell you that how a child is raised early on can have a huge effect on how they view the world, other

people and themselves, not to mention how they react to stressful situations or sort out moral dilemmas. I mean, it’s a big complex challenging world out there and wire monkey baby mama just ain’t gonna cut it. [Intro] Touch. You can convey all sorts of emotions through touch. A hug, a slap, a pat on the back, a poke on the side all convey meaning. Babies learn a lot through touch. It’s how they feel security and trust. You can imagine how all those poor macaques, who were separated not just from their mothers, but everyone, grew up to have some social issues as adults. That is maybe putting it too mildly. Those monkeys showed many signs of being really disturbed, from trouble eating, to rocking back and forth in a trance, to even engaging in self-mutilation.

Most of the macaques used in this study never recovered, and those who were forced into pregnancy didn't know how to care for their own offspring. Although the Harlow's research taught us a lot, it was inhumane and would never pass today's ethical standards. Monkeys, like humans, need to be loved. And loving touch and care are tremendously important, but familiarity is also key to attachment. When you're little, a hug from a stranger is not the same as a hug from your mom or your grandma or your dad or your zookeeper or whomever you're most comfortable and familiar with. The unfamiliar can cause anxiety. And for some critters, all these factors need to come together sooner rather than later.

Some baby animals experience a critical period in early life when certain things have to happen for normal development to occur. For ducks and geese, that critical period occurs just after hatching when they accept the first moving object they see as their mother. This so-called "imprinting process" can be difficult to reverse, which can make things a bit awkward if that moving thing is a golden retriever or a person or a beach ball. Thankfully, human babies don't imprint. The world would be a lot different and a lot more bizarre if they did. Human babies do, however, feel a lot more comfortable around people, things, and settings that they're familiar with. They form emotional attachments, but not all attachments are created equal.

In the 1970's, American psychologist Mary Ainsworth created the "strange situation" experiment to observe children's different attachment styles. She'd put a one-year-old kid and their mom in an unfamiliar room, like a playroom at the lab and then observe the child playing with the mother. Eventually, the child would encounter something potentially stressful. Like, a stranger would come in and interact with the child and then the mom would leave. If the kid freaked out, the stranger would try to comfort them. And then mom would come back and the stranger would leave. Different children responded differently to the strange situation. Ainsworth measured and observed 4 different categories of behavior, including separation

anxiety, the child's willingness to explore, stranger anxiety, and reunion behavior, or how the child reacted when the mom returned, which was what she was particularly interested in. Ainsworth broke this behavior down into three main attachment styles: secure, insecure avoidant, and insecure ambivalent. About 70% of her subjects showed secure attachment and could happily explore their new digs and interact with the stranger, so long as their mom was nearby. If mom left, they might freak out a bit, but they greeted her return in a happy and positive way. About 15% of the kids demonstrated insecure ambivalent attachment. They were afraid of the stranger, cried more and explored less, and had a major freak out when mom left, only to act all salty and mad when she returned.

The last 15% or so showed insecure avoidant attachment. They were fine with the stranger, kinda indifferent actually, didn't cling to mom, didn't seem bothered when she left, showed little interest upon her return. Ainsworth observed that sensitive, attentive mothers usually raised securely attached kids, whereas less responsive mothers who often ignored their children, or super-anxious mothers who obsessed over every little thing, often raised insecurely attached toddlers. And then of course, on the extreme, the poor monkeys with their unresponsive, fake moms, they became absolutely terrified in unfamiliar situations. Attachment is vital. It builds the foundation for our sense of basic trust and quite possibly for our adult

relationships, our motivation to achieve and our willingness to be bold, like that toddler playing with new toys in a strange room. Given what those messed-up monkeys taught us, it should be no surprise that disruptions in attachment can bring a world of pain. Babies raised under abuse or extreme neglect are often withdrawn and frightened, and many parents who've engaged in abusive behavior were abused themselves as children. Young kids exposed to extended abuse, trauma, and neglect are at higher risk for psychological disorders, health problems, and substance abuse as adults. Studies of children raised in understaffed Romanian orphanages, for example, found that they scored lower in cognitive tests and were twice as likely to exhibit symptoms of anxiety

as their counterparts raised in quality foster homes. It's certainly true that some kids can show remarkable resilience, but disrupted attachment and care, often further complicated by social and economic marginalization of all kinds, can leave life-long scars. So if one of infancy's major social achievements is forming positive attachments, then one of the biggest achievements in childhood would have to be achieving a positive sense of self. This self-concept, or an understanding and evaluation of who we are, is usually pretty solid by about the time we turn 12. Charles Darwin proposed that our self-awareness begins when we can recognize ourselves in a mirror. This self-recognition typically doesn't occur in humans under 15 to 18 months.

And by the time that tot's heading to kindergarten, their self-concept is rapidly expanding. They probably know their age, hair color, and family name. Perhaps they know they're good at drawing and not so good at tree climbing, and they're noticing the differences and similarities they share with other people. Kids with positive self-images are more happy, confident, independent, and sociable. So, how can we instill these values and security in kids? And how does parenting affect development? Whether your parents were aloof or affectionate, strict or lax, and whether they spanked you or preferred to talk it out, one model of parenting would probably categorize them into one of three major styles, all related to control.

The authoritarian parent makes rules with consequences and expects you to follow them because "I said so!" and tends to not be very warm to their child. Whereas the permissive parent often caves to their child's demands and exerts little control over any of the child's behavior. The authoritative parent, meanwhile, seeks to find a balance between the two. They are demanding, but always explain the reasons for their rules, and are loving and responsive. And, of course, research indicates that finding that culturally appropriate sweet-spot between too hard and too soft is the best way to go. Now, in addition to that growing sense of self, two other important landmarks of childhood and adolescence are the ability to discern right from wrong and the formation of individual character.

When those two things combine, they give us morality. Last week, we talked about Jean Piaget and his three-tiered model for cognitive development. Well, American psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg modified and expanded on that, and blew it up into his own three-level theory of moral development, which emphasized the notion that our moral reasoning continues to develop throughout our lives. Kohlberg outlined his theory by posing a series of moral dilemmas to children, teens, and adults, and then analyzing their reasoning behind the judgments. One of his most famous questions is known as the Heinz Dilemma. A woman is dying of cancer; there's a special new drug that might save her, but the pharmacist wants to make a big profit, so he charges a lot of money for it.

Her husband, Heinz, can't afford it and has tried everything, from fundraising to begging the pharmacist, to no avail. So, he steals the drug. Was he wrong? Kohlberg was less interested in people's answers than in the reasoning behind their choice. He ended up organizing his subjects' responses into three basic levels of moral thinking. Kohlberg found that if the subject was younger than nine, they were likely in what he called the preconventional morality phase. In this phase, kids are concerned with self-interest, but they're also starting to judge people individually, based on their needs and point of view. So, Heinz needed the medicine, and stealing it best served his needs.

But in the second phase, in early adolescence, our moral compasses seem to shift, during what Kohlberg called the conventional morality phase. Here, his subjects put an emphasis on conformity and worry about what would happen to Heinz if he was seen as a criminal. This phase seems to worry "what would people think?". From adolescence on, Kohlberg believes, some people exist in the postconventional morality phase. This is a more complex adult morality, when we begin to account for differing values and basic rights. Laws are important, but some situations, like saving your beloved's life, might overrule them. This phase tops out with reasoning based on universal ethical principles and more abstract reasoning.

Heinz was right to steal the medicine because people have a right to live. Critics of Kohlberg's set up question his emphasis on moral thinking rather than moral action, arguing that there's a big difference between reasoning out what you should do and actually doing it. But one thing's for sure, what we experience during our first years on this planet, the nature and quality of our attachments, our sense of self, and our moral development, they all set the stage of our adolescence and adulthood. Today, your developing brain learned about Ainsworth's three styles of secure, insecure avoidant, and insecure ambivalent attachment. And about authoritarian, permissive, and authoritative parenting styles.

### Transcript (navigation)

- [00:00] So you’ve probably seen a little kid react to a sudden bang or a terrifying clown or
- [00:04] some strange Santa at the mall, right?
- [00:07] Yeah, not pretty.
- [00:08] That child probably immediately reached for a parent, looking for comfort, and that same
- [00:12] kid might freak out if she was separated from her adult of choice, especially is she was
- [00:17] in an unfamiliar environment.
- [00:18] It’s called attachment and if you’ve ever seen a clingy kid you know why it’s called
- [00:22] that.
- [00:23] They attach.
- [00:24] For a long time psychologists assumed that this was just an intense innate survival instinct;
- [00:28] I mean it makes sense that babies would be attached to their food source and bigger kids
- [00:32] would stick around to the people who helped them survive.
- [00:34] But in the 1950s American psychologists Harry and Margaret Harlow came along with a barrel
- [00:38] of monkeys, complicating and illuminating our idea of bonding with caregivers in what
- [00:43] has to be one of the saddest psychological experiments of all time.
- [00:47] The Harlow’s were breeding Rhesus macaque monkeys for their research on learning.
- [00:51] Part of the process involved separating babies from their mothers right after birth, which,
- [00:56] yeah, pretty cruel already.
- [00:57] They began noticing that baby monkeys were very attached to the blankets they had in
- [01:02] their cages, so they set up an experiment.
- [01:04] They created two artificial mothers.
- [01:07] One was a bare wire cylinder with a feeding bottle attached; they called that Wire Mother,
- [01:11] and the other was a cozier cloth and foam wrapped cylinder without a feeding bottle:
- [01:16] Cloth Mother.
- [01:17] It took no time at all to see the baby’s preference.
- [01:19] They overwhelming preferred the comfy cloth mama, clinging to it whenever they seemed
- [01:24] to be anxious or in need of comfort, and sometimes they fed from the Wire Mother with the baby
- [01:29] bottle while standing on the cloth one.
- [01:31] This discovery that attachment wasn’t just about getting breakfast surprised a lot of
- [01:35] people.
- [01:36] It turns out that contact and touch are vital to attachment, learning, emotional well-being,
- [01:40] and psychological development.
- [01:42] As the brain and mind develop in infants so too do they’re emotions and social behavior.
- [01:47] Caregivers can greatly influence this development, and most psychologists will tell you that
- [01:51] how a child is raised early on can have a huge effect on how they view the world, other
- [01:55] people and themselves, not to mention how they react to stressful situations or sort
- [02:00] out moral dilemmas.
- [02:01] I mean, it’s a big complex challenging world out there and wire monkey baby mama just ain’t
- [02:07] gonna cut it.
- [02:11] [Intro]
- [02:14] Touch.
- [02:18] You can convey all sorts of emotions through touch.
- [02:20] A hug, a slap, a pat on the back, a poke on the side all convey meaning.
- [02:25] Babies learn a lot through touch.
- [02:26] It’s how they feel security and trust.
- [02:29] You can imagine how all those poor macaques, who were separated not just from their mothers,
- [02:33] but everyone, grew up to have some social issues as adults.
- [02:37] That is maybe putting it too mildly.
- [02:39] Those monkeys showed many signs of being really disturbed, from trouble eating, to rocking
- [02:43] back and forth in a trance, to even engaging in self-mutilation.
- [02:45] Most of the macaques used in this study never recovered, and those who were forced into
- [02:50] pregnancy didn't know how to care for their own offspring.
- [02:53] Although the Harlow's research taught us a lot, it was inhumane and would never pass
- [02:57] today's ethical standards.
- [02:59] Monkeys, like humans, need to be loved.
- [03:02] And loving touch and care are tremendously important, but familiarity is also key to
- [03:07] attachment.
- [03:08] When you're little, a hug from a stranger is not the same as a hug from your mom or
- [03:10] your grandma or your dad or your zookeeper or whomever you're most comfortable and familiar
- [03:15] with.
- [03:16] The unfamiliar can cause anxiety.
- [03:17] And for some critters, all these factors need to come together sooner rather than later.
- [03:21] Some baby animals experience a critical period in early life when certain things have to
- [03:25] happen for normal development to occur.
- [03:27] For ducks and geese, that critical period occurs just after hatching when they accept
- [03:31] the first moving object they see as their mother.
- [03:33] This so-called "imprinting process" can be difficult to reverse, which can make things
- [03:37] a bit awkward if that moving thing is a golden retriever or a person or a beach ball.
- [03:42] Thankfully, human babies don't imprint.
- [03:44] The world would be a lot different and a lot more bizarre if they did.
- [03:48] Human babies do, however, feel a lot more comfortable around people, things, and settings
- [03:51] that they're familiar with.
- [03:53] They form emotional attachments, but not all attachments are created equal.
- [03:57] In the 1970's, American psychologist Mary Ainsworth created the "strange situation"
- [04:02] experiment to observe children's different attachment styles.
- [04:05] She'd put a one-year-old kid and their mom in an unfamiliar room, like a playroom at
- [04:09] the lab and then observe the child playing with the mother.
- [04:12] Eventually, the child would encounter something potentially stressful.
- [04:15] Like, a stranger would come in and interact with the child and then the mom would leave.
- [04:18] If the kid freaked out, the stranger would try to comfort them.
- [04:21] And then mom would come back and the stranger would leave.
- [04:24] Different children responded differently to the strange situation.
- [04:27] Ainsworth measured and observed 4 different categories of behavior, including separation
- [04:31] anxiety, the child's willingness to explore, stranger anxiety, and reunion behavior, or
- [04:36] how the child reacted when the mom returned, which was what she was particularly interested
- [04:40] in.
- [04:41] Ainsworth broke this behavior down into three main attachment styles: secure, insecure avoidant,
- [04:46] and insecure ambivalent.
- [04:47] About 70% of her subjects showed secure attachment and could happily explore their new digs and
- [04:52] interact with the stranger, so long as their mom was nearby.
- [04:55] If mom left, they might freak out a bit, but they greeted her return in a happy and positive
- [05:00] way.
- [05:01] About 15% of the kids demonstrated insecure ambivalent attachment.
- [05:04] They were afraid of the stranger, cried more and explored less, and had a major freak out
- [05:09] when mom left, only to act all salty and mad when she returned.
- [05:13] The last 15% or so showed insecure avoidant attachment.
- [05:17] They were fine with the stranger, kinda indifferent actually, didn't cling to mom, didn't seem
- [05:22] bothered when she left, showed little interest upon her return.
- [05:25] Ainsworth observed that sensitive, attentive mothers usually raised securely attached kids,
- [05:30] whereas less responsive mothers who often ignored their children, or super-anxious mothers
- [05:34] who obsessed over every little thing, often raised insecurely attached toddlers.
- [05:38] And then of course, on the extreme, the poor monkeys with their unresponsive, fake moms,
- [05:44] they became absolutely terrified in unfamiliar situations.

### Transcript (reading)

So far in our exploration of how the mind grows, we've talked about a lot of different philosophies and models and ways of looking at things. But here's a surprisingly useful tool for understanding developmental psychology: The Breakfast Club. This video, by the way, will contain Breakfast Club spoilers. That classic 80s movie about a band of teenagers stuck in detention one fateful Saturday morning. Do they do Saturday detentions anymore? That was never a "thing" at my school. That was crazy, the idea that kids would come in on a weekend for detention. You got the hoodlum, the jock, the nerd, the princess, and the so-called basketcase, And at first, they're all salty and standoffish with each other.

Because you know, let's face it, American high schools are sort of a breeding ground for that kind of thing. But as the day progresses, they start to open up and share things and have a little fun by way of a dance montage. And at some point they each kind of crack, revealing something very important about adolescence in the process, which is - The struggle between the need to stand out, and the need to belong. All these kids feel tremendous pressure to maintain their image in their particular group in part because there's just some security in belonging to a group, even if that group gets picked on by another group. And so they wear the corresponding diamond earrings, combat boots, lettermans jackets, and spectacles, and act how their roles dictate.

But the thing is, none of those kids are satisfied with their outward identities. Instead, they're all stuck in the classic teenage struggle, one that German psychoanalyst Erik Erikson - yes, his name is actually Erik Erikson - called the crisis between identity and role confusion. In other words, their newly-forming identities were at odds with other people's expectations of what roles they should play, hence the confusion. The past couple weeks, we've been talking about childhood as a crucial period of growth, learning, and change, and it definitely is, but anyone who's ever seen a John Hughes movie knows that there's way more to growing up than just that. And I got some news for you - from adolescence into adulthood and into old age,

the drama of your personal psychological development never ceases. Never! So get used to it. [INTRO] Today, most psychologists view our psychological development as a lifelong process from infant, to adolescent, to adult, to card-carrying senior citizen, people keep right on changing. Just as Piaget gave us a helpful framework for thinking about early development, other scholars have given us ideas about how we develop through the rest of our lives, particularly Erik Erikson. Like many others, Erikson believed our personalities develop in a predetermined order, which he outlined in an eight-stage model. And each stage, from infancy to old age, is defined by its own predominant issue or crisis.

If it freaks you out to think that you will always be dealing with a crisis at every stage of your life, we can just call them "issues." Since we already talked a lot about early childhood development, I'm gonna skip ahead to the teenage meat of it. But you can consult this table to learn about the rest. Erikson defined the adolescent years, or "Stage 5," as starting in our teens, and extending for some as far as our early twenties. And as The Breakfast Club so artfully depicted, its main crisis is the one of identity vs. role confusion. Teen years are marked by lots of physical changes in the body and brain and sex hormones, along with growing independence, but also a real need to belong to something.

This often angsty time is when teens reexamine their identities, figuring out how to both blend in and how to stand out, often by trying on different roles. Maybe they're experimenting with punk rock, or hockey, or theater, or ancient philosophy. Maybe sophomore year they're preppy. Junior year they've got green hair. Hopefully a person comes out of this stage with a reintegrated sense of self, but this stage can be particularly confusing as I'm sure anybody watching this video can attest to. But of course, that's not the last crisis - sorry, "issue." Erikson believed that young adulthood, which in his view, started in a person's 20s and ended as late as the early 40s, was marked by another struggle, one between intimacy and isolation.

By this stage in life, most of us have begun exploring intimate relationships, whether that's with a steady sweetheart, or just an active OkCupid profile. A good relationship here can lead to feelings of safety and caring and commitment, while a lack of intimacy can lead to loneliness and isolation and depression. Recently, a number of psychologists have begun to refer to the first few years of this stage as emerging adulthood, and some suggest that it warrants its own classification distinct from adolescence or full adulthood. And at least in modern western culture, many people in this stage do feel like they're stuck in a sort of in-between time. They know that they've pulled through all that high school stuff, but they're still pretty tied to their families.

In 2011, the U.S. Census found that 65% of people under 24 still live with their parents. Just a reminder of how things like economic factors can weigh on development. For Erikson, after young adulthood came the middle adulthood of our 40s to 60s. This stage, Stage 7, highlights our tendency toward either generativity or stagnation. By now, many people have established jobs or careers or perhaps families of their own. We better understand the bigger picture of life and contribute to society through productive, or generative, activities like work, community involvement, raising kids, paying taxes, all that grown-up stuff. The lack of those things, an overall boredom or absence of purpose, can make Stage 7-ers feel stagnant and unproductive,

hence the often cliched, but really real and potentially painful, mid-life crisis. And finally, at the end, comes Stage 8. In our late adulthood, from 65 and up, we often struggle with integrity vs. despair. Maybe you've hung out with a grandparent or some other senior and heard them contemplating their lives and accomplishments and reminiscing about how cheap a milkshake used to be. Well, if their overall vibe is positive, they've probably developed a sense of integrity and completeness, meaning they're pretty satisfied with a life well lived. The flip side of that is looking back on life and feeling guilt and regret, and that kind of retrospective disappointment can ruin old age with depression and feelings of hopelessness.

Again, Erikson's model isn't really a perfect contemporary one, but it gave us an early idea of conflict and growth over our whole lives. His ideas have been developed further and even challenged by other scholars, but like Piaget, he remains a crucial figure to know in Western psychology. So Erikson tackled our progressive psychosocial development, but what exactly happens to our bodies and brains after we hit adulthood and keep racking up the birthday cake candles? It's hard to generalize these stages of adulthood because we don't really hit yearly milestones like we did when we were kids, and adult lifestyles can vary a whole lot. I mean, in a lot of ways, 70-year-old Mick Jagger's still living a younger lifestyle than a lot of 20-somethings I know.

But despite all our differences, many of our life courses do have some similarities -- physically, cognitively, and socially. First, there are, yes, physical changes: the slow decline of reaction time, muscle tone, and strength, cardiac output, sex hormone production, and sharpness of senses like hearing and sight. For most of us, bifocals are inevitable, and perhaps hearing aids as well. None of this is to say that a jacked 50-year-old couldn't beat a lazy 20-year-old on a 100-meter dash, because, of course, how well you take care of your body counts for a lot. But still, you can't stop, let alone reverse the process of aging. The good news is our intelligence remains pretty stable throughout adulthood.

Although some people might feel that their wits get a bit fuzzy with age, research suggests that while one kind of intelligence decreases after adolescence, another kind keeps increasing throughout your lifetime. Psychologists Raymond Cattell and John Horn were the first to develop the concepts of fluid and crystallized intelligence, suggesting that intelligence itself is made up of different abilities that work together. Fluid intelligence deals with your ability to solve problems independent of your personal experience and education. It's typically associated with thinking both quickly and abstractly, like teasing out the logic of a puzzle, rather than remembering how to find the cosine of an angle.

So relatively inexperienced teens often show high fluid intelligence. The bummer is it peaks in adolescence, then typically starts its slow decline in the 30s... So I'm experiencing that now... Crystallized intelligence, on the other hand, is just what it sounds like: knowledge that's based on facts, solidified by past experiences and prior learning. This type of experiential intelligence gets stronger with age, as we continue to take in new knowledge and understanding, and it's part of why grandmas are so good at crossword puzzles! Both fluid and crystallized intelligence are equally important on any given day, and ideally, they work together to get the job of thinking done.

So in the end, some of our thinking gets rusty with age, but some of it keeps getting better. Of course, there are exceptions. While most people who live into their 90s are still pretty sharp, some will experience a substantial loss of brain cells and suffer serious consequences. Brain tumors, small strokes, or continued alcohol dependence can all progressively damage the brain, increasing the risk of dementia. Dementia isn't a specific disease, but rather a set of symptoms related to impaired thinking, memory loss, confusion, and potential changes in personality that become severe enough to interfere with regular functioning. Alzheimer's disease is a form of progressive, irreversible dementia.

First, memory declines, then reasoning, and then eventually basic physiological functions as vital brain neurons continue to deteriorate. It strikes about 3% of the world's population before age 75, although from there, the rate roughly doubles every five years. But again, not all dementia is related to Alzheimer's disease, nor is it as extreme. And while the risk of dementia certainly increases in older adults, it's important to remember that it is not part of normal, healthy aging. Some memory changes are normal, but most memories should remain intact. In the end, we still have a lot to learn about the aging process. As our lifespans continue to get longer, we might need to tweak what we think we know about its effects on human psychology.

In some ways, you might say that this is psychology's next frontier. By the time we figure out what that looks like, the cast of The Breakfast Club might just be ready for a reunion... and they'd better make a movie about it. Today, your developing brain learned about Erikson's eight stages of progressive psychosocial development and their accompanying issues. You also learned about emerging adulthood, the differences between fluid and crystalline intelligence, and some facts about dementia and Alzheimer's disease.

### Transcript (navigation)

- [00:00] So far in our exploration of how the mind grows,
- [00:03] we've talked about a lot of different philosophies and models and ways of looking at things.
- [00:07] But here's a surprisingly useful tool for understanding developmental psychology:
- [00:11] The Breakfast Club. This video, by the way, will contain Breakfast Club spoilers.
- [00:15] That classic 80s movie about a band of teenagers
- [00:18] stuck in detention one fateful Saturday morning.
- [00:20] Do they do Saturday detentions anymore?
- [00:23] That was never a "thing" at my school.
- [00:25] That was crazy, the idea that kids would come in on a weekend for detention.
- [00:29] You got the hoodlum, the jock, the nerd, the princess, and the so-called basketcase,
- [00:33] And at first, they're all salty and standoffish with each other.
- [00:36] Because you know, let's face it, American high schools are sort of a breeding ground for that kind of thing.
- [00:39] But as the day progresses, they start to open up and share things
- [00:42] and have a little fun by way of a dance montage.
- [00:45] And at some point they each kind of crack, revealing something very important
- [00:48] about adolescence in the process, which is -
- [00:51] The struggle between the need to stand out, and the need to belong.
- [00:54] All these kids feel tremendous pressure to maintain their image in their particular group
- [00:59] in part because there's just some security in belonging to a group,
- [01:02] even if that group gets picked on by another group.
- [01:05] And so they wear the corresponding diamond earrings,
- [01:07] combat boots, lettermans jackets, and spectacles, and act how their roles dictate.
- [01:12] But the thing is, none of those kids are satisfied with their outward identities.
- [01:16] Instead, they're all stuck in the classic teenage struggle,
- [01:19] one that German psychoanalyst Erik Erikson -
- [01:21] yes, his name is actually Erik Erikson -
- [01:23] called the crisis between identity and role confusion.
- [01:27] In other words, their newly-forming identities were at odds
- [01:30] with other people's expectations of what roles they should play, hence the confusion.
- [01:34] The past couple weeks, we've been talking about childhood as
- [01:37] a crucial period of growth, learning, and change, and it definitely is,
- [01:41] but anyone who's ever seen a John Hughes movie knows
- [01:43] that there's way more to growing up than just that.
- [01:46] And I got some news for you -
- [01:48] from adolescence into adulthood and into old age,
- [01:51] the drama of your personal psychological development never ceases.
- [01:54] Never! So get used to it.
- [01:57] [INTRO]
- [02:06] Today, most psychologists view our psychological development as a lifelong process
- [02:10] from infant, to adolescent, to adult,
- [02:12] to card-carrying senior citizen, people keep right on changing.
- [02:16] Just as Piaget gave us a helpful framework for thinking about early development,
- [02:20] other scholars have given us ideas about how we develop
- [02:23] through the rest of our lives, particularly Erik Erikson.
- [02:26] Like many others, Erikson believed our personalities develop in a predetermined order,
- [02:30] which he outlined in an eight-stage model.
- [02:32] And each stage, from infancy to old age, is defined by
- [02:35] its own predominant issue or crisis.
- [02:38] If it freaks you out to think that you will always be dealing with a crisis
- [02:41] at every stage of your life, we can just call them "issues."
- [02:44] Since we already talked a lot about early childhood development,
- [02:47] I'm gonna skip ahead to the teenage meat of it.
- [02:49] But you can consult this table to learn about the rest.
- [02:52] Erikson defined the adolescent years, or "Stage 5,"
- [02:54] as starting in our teens, and extending for some as far as our early twenties.
- [02:58] And as The Breakfast Club so artfully depicted,
- [03:01] its main crisis is the one of identity vs. role confusion.
- [03:04] Teen years are marked by lots of physical changes
- [03:07] in the body and brain and sex hormones, along with growing independence,
- [03:11] but also a real need to belong to something.
- [03:14] This often angsty time is when teens reexamine their identities,
- [03:18] figuring out how to both blend in and how to stand out,
- [03:21] often by trying on different roles.
- [03:23] Maybe they're experimenting with punk rock,
- [03:25] or hockey, or theater, or ancient philosophy.
- [03:28] Maybe sophomore year they're preppy. Junior year they've got green hair.
- [03:31] Hopefully a person comes out of this stage with a reintegrated sense of self,
- [03:34] but this stage can be particularly confusing as I'm sure anybody watching this video can attest to.
- [03:39] But of course, that's not the last crisis - sorry, "issue."
- [03:43] Erikson believed that young adulthood, which in his view,
- [03:45] started in a person's 20s and ended as late as the early 40s,
- [03:49] was marked by another struggle, one between intimacy and isolation.
- [03:52] By this stage in life, most of us have begun exploring intimate relationships,
- [03:56] whether that's with a steady sweetheart, or just an active OkCupid profile.
- [03:59] A good relationship here can lead to feelings of safety and caring and commitment,
- [04:03] while a lack of intimacy can lead to loneliness and isolation and depression.
- [04:06] Recently, a number of psychologists have begun to refer to the first few years of this stage as
- [04:10] emerging adulthood, and some suggest that it warrants its own classification
- [04:14] distinct from adolescence or full adulthood.
- [04:17] And at least in modern western culture, many people in this stage
- [04:20] do feel like they're stuck in a sort of in-between time.
- [04:23] They know that they've pulled through all that high school stuff, but they're still pretty tied to their families.
- [04:26] In 2011, the U.S. Census found that 65% of people under 24 still live with their parents.
- [04:32] Just a reminder of how things like economic factors can weigh on development.
- [04:35] For Erikson, after young adulthood came the middle adulthood of our 40s to 60s.
- [04:40] This stage, Stage 7, highlights our tendency toward either generativity or stagnation.
- [04:45] By now, many people have established jobs or careers or perhaps families of their own.
- [04:49] We better understand the bigger picture of life and contribute to society
- [04:52] through productive, or generative, activities
- [04:54] like work, community involvement, raising kids, paying taxes, all that grown-up stuff.
- [04:59] The lack of those things, an overall boredom or absence of purpose,
- [05:02] can make Stage 7-ers feel stagnant and unproductive,
- [05:06] hence the often cliched, but really real and potentially painful, mid-life crisis.
- [05:10] And finally, at the end, comes Stage 8.
- [05:13] In our late adulthood, from 65 and up, we often struggle with integrity vs. despair.
- [05:18] Maybe you've hung out with a grandparent or some other senior and heard them contemplating
- [05:21] their lives and accomplishments and reminiscing about how cheap a milkshake used to be.
- [05:25] Well, if their overall vibe is positive,
- [05:28] they've probably developed a sense of integrity and completeness,
- [05:31] meaning they're pretty satisfied with a life well lived.
- [05:33] The flip side of that is looking back on life and feeling guilt and regret, and that kind of
- [05:37] retrospective disappointment can ruin old age with depression and feelings of hopelessness.
- [05:41] Again, Erikson's model isn't really a perfect contemporary one,
- [05:45] but it gave us an early idea of conflict and growth over our whole lives.
- [05:49] His ideas have been developed further and even challenged by other scholars,
- [05:53] but like Piaget, he remains a crucial figure to know in Western psychology.
- [05:57] So Erikson tackled our progressive psychosocial development,
- [06:00] but what exactly happens to our bodies and brains after we hit adulthood
- [06:04] and keep racking up the birthday cake candles?
- [06:06] It's hard to generalize these stages of adulthood because
- [06:08] we don't really hit yearly milestones like we did when we were kids,
- [06:11] and adult lifestyles can vary a whole lot. I mean, in a lot of ways,
- [06:14] 70-year-old Mick Jagger's still living a younger lifestyle than a lot of 20-somethings I know.

- [06:46] But still, you can't stop, let alone reverse the process of aging.

- [07:07] fluid and crystallized intelligence, suggesting that
- [07:10] intelligence itself is made up of different abilities that work together.
- [07:14] Fluid intelligence deals with your ability to solve problems
- [07:17] independent of your personal experience and education.
- [07:19] It's typically associated with thinking both quickly and abstractly,
- [07:23] like teasing out the logic of a puzzle, rather than
- [07:25] remembering how to find the cosine of an angle.
- [07:28] So relatively inexperienced teens often show high fluid intelligence.
- [07:32] The bummer is it peaks in adolescence,
- [07:35] then typically starts its slow decline in the 30s...
- [07:38] So I'm experiencing that now...

Did you know that astronauts in space have a hard time communicating without words because their weightless bodily fluids make their faces all puffy and hard to read? Have you heard that Botox can actually improve your mood, and not by smoothing wrinkles but actually by easing depression? Or that this "come here" gesture is common in the US but is considered so rude in the Philippines that it could actually get you arrested. Yeah. All true! Emotions and the ways we express them are strange and powerful things. And emotions aren't just ephemeral psychological phenomena, they affect our bodies and our health. Because so many emotions have a certain contagious quality, our feelings and the behaviors they drive also affect the minds, and bodies, and health of those around us.

This is true whether your emotions of the moment are of the feel-good variety. Or not. The powers of both positivity and negativity are stronger than you may know. Lots of studies have shown that people with a positive outlook on life tend to live longer, more fulfilling lives than their mean and grumpy neighbors. Fear, anger, and other more difficult emotions and how we handle them are pretty closely related to this thing called stress. And stress is so powerful that it can straight up kill you in any number of ways, given the right opportunity. For better or worse we spend a lot of our lives swirling around like leaves on the winds of competing emotions. Before we can hope to harness these feelings, we first have to understand them.

[Intro] What do you think this person is feeling? How about him? And her? What about this one? It's not really hard to tell, is it? Most of us are better than we think at reading non-verbal cues and subtle expressions. The understanding among some, but not all, psychologists, like emotion expert Paul Ekman, is that facial expressions are culturally universal. So a Greek, Britain, American, Samoan, or Nigerian would all be able to discern the same basic emotions; happiness, sadness, disgust, anger, fear, and surprise, just by looking at your face. And our expressions don't just communicate emotions. According to the Facial Feedback Hypothesis, they can help regulate our emotions, too.

The act of smiling broadly, even if you aren't happy, can actually lift your mood just as scowling can lower it. This is how, bizarrely enough, a recent randomized controlled clinical trial suggested that a little Botox injection in the forehead might actually lessen depression. 'Cause it's apparently hard to feel down if your frowny muscles are frozen. Of course whether your face is paralyzed or not, some people are better at reading your emotions than others. For example, introverts are usually better at interpreting people's feelings, while extroverts are often better at expressing them. And you've probably heard embarrassing stories or even experienced first-hand how different cultures express emotions through particular gestures that are far from universal.

For example, in the United States, this is a peace sign, but you don't want to flip it around in the UK. And the iconic thumbs up gesture means "good job" in many cultures, but if you toss that thumb around in Greece, well let's just say you won't make any new friends. But of course emotions involve a lot more than making faces and hand gestures, they're also about our conscious experience of what we're feeling. So how do we actually feel all these feels, and how many different emotions are there? Back in the 1970s, American psychologist Carol Izard identified ten distinct basic human emotions present from infancy on. They are: joy, surprise, sadness, anger, disgust, contempt, shame, fear, guilt, and interest or excitement.

Others have since suggested that "pride" should be added to that list, and still others believe that love should be classified as a basic emotion as well, but Izard has argued that these and other emotions are just familiar combinations of the classic ten. Today, some psychologists describe our emotional experience as using a 2-dimensional model. The idea there is that any of the emotions you might feel while, like, reading Harry Potter or something are expressed on a spectrum, and as a combination of valence, roughly speaking "good" or "bad", and arousal--excited or not excited, basically. So if you're feeling both really excited and super positive when Harry finally bested Voldemort, you could say you were elated. On the other hand,

if you're at that part in Deathly Hallows when Harry, Ron and Hermoine are just sort of wandering around on the lam in a heavy mood, maybe your emotions fell more on the opposite side of the spectrum. In this instance, feeling depressed might be a combination of negative emotion and lack of excitement. So potentially every emotion can fall in degrees on this 2-dimensional scale. Like being terrified means you're more frightened than if you're just scared, just as being enraged is a more extreme form of anger than simply being mad. These polarities--positive versus negative, high arousal versus low arousal--affect our psychological states, and therefore our bodies as well. Because, you'll remember that what is psychological is ultimately

biological. And when it comes to the physical effects of our emotions, it pretty much goes the way you might expect. Happiness is helpful while chronic anger or depression makes us vulnerable to all kinds of problems with health and well-being. The good news is that if we're angry or sad, we often over-estimate the duration of our bad moods and under-estimate our capacity to adapt and bounce back from traumas, even if things feel hopeless, depressing, or stressful in the thick of it. And we've all experienced stress before, sometimes on a daily or even hourly basis. Much like anger or joy, stress can slowly build and simmer, or it can strike suddenly and with great intensity.

And yeah, stress, certainly the chronic or extreme type can be bad for your health, but defining stress is trickier than you might think. Psychologists would define stress as the process by which we perceive and respond to certain events, or stressors, that we view as challenging or threatening. In other words, stress isn't technically an emotion, it's more of a reaction to a disturbing or disruptive stimulus. And our reactions stem in part from our appraisal of that stimulus. A person can either roll with, or get worked up about a missed flight, an increased workload, or a strange thump in the house. These external stressors typically fall into three main categories: catastrophes, or unpredictable large scale events like war, natural

disasters and terrorist attacks; significant life changes, things like moving, having a child, losing or getting a job, or the death of a loved on; and then just everyday inconveniences like getting caught in traffic, running late, or feuding with your roommates. Any of these stressful events, big or small, even the good things, can fire up your sympathetic nervous system and trigger that old fight or flight response. In this way, it's important to understand that stress is ultimately natural. You experience it for a reason and a bit of short-lived stress can actually be a good thing. It can make you active and alert when you need to be, like an upcoming chemistry test might be stressing you out, but that might help you find focus so you can

dominate that thing. And in your body, moderate stress can kick the immune system into action to do things like heal wounds, and fight infections. It does this by triggering the release of stress hormones like adrenaline and cortisol. These chemical messengers are what get your organ systems to respond the way you need them to when you're getting charged by a bear, or focusing really hard on the gas law for your chemistry test. But to also why chronic stress can really wreck a body and mind, research has shown that abused children have a high risk of chronic disease and people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, which we'll talk about in an upcoming episode, experience higher rates of digestive, respiratory, circulatory, and infectious diseases. A lot of these

negative connections between your body's systems have to do with the fact that many of its most basic functions, like blood pressure, breathing, body temperature, digestion, and heartbeat, are in part regulated by the autonomic nervous system. We've talked before about how the sympathetic side of that system cranks you up, and the parasympathetic arm calms you down, but both those systems also interact with the so-called "brain-in-the-gut", the enteric nervous system, which helps regulate gastrointestional functioning. And it's this brain-gut connection that explains how stress causes digestive problems, because when that werewolf pops out of the bushes and a wave of cortisol washes through you, your body wants to focus its energy on sending blood to your

muscles so that you can react quickly. Which is good, right? But it may do that partly by shutting down digestion or decreasing the amount of digestive secretions and making your colon spasm; an anxious mind can lead to an anxious gut. Stress is an even bigger risk factor in North America's leading cause of death: heart disease, because it contributes to increased blood pressure, heart rate, and cholesterol levels in a number of different ways. Essentially, when your stressed out nervous system is redirecting all of its energy sources to your muscles and brain, it pulls flow away from your other organs. And one of those organs is the liver, whose job includes removing the fat and cholesterol from your blood. So basically, when a stressed liver

can't filter properly, that extra fat and cholesterol ends up circulating in your blood, which can settle around the heart. Don't believe me? One study monitored the blood cholesterol and clotting speed of 40 male tax accountants throughout the year, and it found that their cholesterol and clotting rates, and thus risk of heart attacks, increased dramatically during the weeks before tax day as they stressed out about finishing their work. And physiologically speaking, it's worth pointing out that some close relatives to stress, when it comes to their effects on the body, are pessimism and depression, which also have been linked to stress and heart disease. Many types of studies have found that people characterized by their optimism, happiness, love, and

positive feelings often live significantly longer than their grumpy, dour counterparts. Researchers don't quite know exactly how chronic negative emotional states influence health, but it may be some combination of lifestyle or behavioral factors, like neglecting your health, or not taking your heart meds when you're feeling blue, or social factors like the way the depression can be isolating and thus prevent others from helping you out. Or biological factors, like increases in certain kinds of inflammatory proteins released by the immune system in response to stress and sadness. So in the end, while stress may not directly cause disease, you could say that the two walk hand-in-hand.

In that way, it isn't a stretch to say that chronic stress can kill, so go ahead take a deep breath, feel your emotions, appreciate them, but don't let them run your life. Today, we talked more about how our emotions work and how we use facial expressions to help us communicate. We also looked at the 2-dimensional model of emotional experience and how anger, happiness, and depression can affect our health. We also discussed what stress does to your nervous system and how chronic stress can damage the functioning of your biological systems.

- [00:09] improve your mood, and not by smoothing wrinkles but
- [00:12] actually by easing depression?
- [00:14] Or that this "come here" gesture is
- [00:16] common in the US but is considered so rude in the
- [00:17] Philippines that it could actually get you arrested.
- [00:20] Yeah. All true!
- [00:22] Emotions and the ways we express them
- [00:24] are strange and powerful things.
- [00:26] And emotions aren't just ephemeral psychological
- [00:28] phenomena, they affect our bodies and our health.
- [00:30] Because so many emotions have a certain
- [00:32] contagious quality, our feelings and the behaviors
- [00:34] they drive also affect the minds, and bodies,
- [00:36] and health of those around us.
- [00:38] This is true whether your emotions of the moment
- [00:40] are of the feel-good variety.
- [00:42] Or not.
- [00:44] The powers of both positivity and negativity are
- [00:45] stronger than you may know.
- [00:47] Lots of studies have shown that people with a positive
- [00:48] outlook on life tend to live longer, more fulfilling lives
- [00:52] than their mean and grumpy neighbors.
- [00:54] Fear, anger, and other more difficult emotions
- [00:56] and how we handle them are pretty closely
- [00:58] related to this thing called stress.
- [01:00] And stress is so powerful that it can straight up kill you
- [01:03] in any number of ways, given the right opportunity.
- [01:05] For better or worse we spend a lot of our lives
- [01:08] swirling around like leaves on the winds of
- [01:10] competing emotions. Before we can hope to harness
- [01:12] these feelings, we first have to understand them.
- [01:16] [Intro]
- [01:25] What do you think this person is feeling?
- [01:27] How about him?
- [01:28] And her?
- [01:29] What about this one?
- [01:30] It's not really hard to tell, is it?
- [01:31] Most of us are better than we think at
- [01:32] reading non-verbal cues and subtle expressions.
- [01:34] The understanding among some, but not all,
- [01:36] psychologists, like emotion expert Paul Ekman,
- [01:40] is that facial expressions are culturally universal.
- [01:42] So a Greek, Britain, American, Samoan, or Nigerian
- [01:46] would all be able to discern the same basic emotions;
- [01:48] happiness, sadness, disgust, anger, fear, and surprise,
- [01:52] just by looking at your face.
- [01:54] And our expressions don't just communicate emotions.
- [01:56] According to the Facial Feedback Hypothesis,
- [01:58] they can help regulate our emotions, too.
- [02:00] The act of smiling broadly, even if you aren't happy,
- [02:03] can actually lift your mood just as scowling can lower it.
- [02:06] This is how, bizarrely enough, a recent randomized
- [02:10] controlled clinical trial suggested that a little Botox
- [02:12] injection in the forehead might actually lessen
- [02:15] depression.
- [02:16] 'Cause it's apparently hard to feel down if your
- [02:18] frowny muscles are frozen.
- [02:19] Of course whether your face is paralyzed or not, some
- [02:21] people are better at reading your emotions than others.
- [02:24] For example, introverts are usually better at interpreting
- [02:26] people's feelings, while extroverts are often better at
- [02:28] expressing them.
- [02:30] And you've probably heard embarrassing stories or even
- [02:32] experienced first-hand how different cultures express
- [02:34] emotions through particular gestures that are far from universal.
- [02:38] For example, in the United States, this is a peace sign,
- [02:40] but you don't want to flip it around in the UK.
- [02:43] And the iconic thumbs up gesture means "good job" in
- [02:46] many cultures, but if you toss that thumb around in
- [02:48] Greece, well let's just say you won't make any new
- [02:50] friends.
- [02:50] But of course emotions involve a lot more than making faces
- [02:53] and hand gestures, they're also about our
- [02:55] conscious experience of what we're feeling.
- [02:58] So how do we actually feel all these feels, and how
- [03:01] many different emotions are there?
- [03:02] Back in the 1970s, American psychologist Carol Izard
- [03:05] identified ten distinct basic human emotions present
- [03:08] from infancy on.
- [03:09] They are: joy, surprise, sadness,  anger, disgust,
- [03:13] contempt, shame, fear, guilt, and interest or excitement.
- [03:17] Others have since suggested that "pride" should be
- [03:19] added to that list, and still others believe that love should
- [03:22] be classified as a basic emotion as well, but Izard has
- [03:24] argued that these and other emotions are just familiar
- [03:27] combinations of the classic ten.
- [03:29] Today, some psychologists describe our emotional
- [03:31] experience as using a 2-dimensional model.
- [03:33] The idea there is that any of the emotions you might feel
- [03:36] while, like, reading Harry Potter or something are
- [03:38] expressed on a spectrum, and as a combination of
- [03:40] valence, roughly speaking "good" or "bad", and
- [03:42] arousal--excited or not excited, basically.
- [03:46] So if you're feeling both really excited and super
- [03:48] positive when Harry finally bested Voldemort,
- [03:50] you could say you were elated. On the other hand,
- [03:52] if you're at that part in Deathly Hallows when Harry, Ron
- [03:54] and Hermoine are just sort of wandering around on the
- [03:57] lam in a heavy mood, maybe your emotions fell more on
- [04:00] the opposite side of the spectrum.
- [04:01] In this instance, feeling depressed might be a
- [04:03] combination of negative emotion and lack of excitement.
- [04:06] So potentially every emotion can fall in degrees on this
- [04:08] 2-dimensional scale. Like being terrified means you're
- [04:11] more frightened than if you're just scared, just as being
- [04:14] enraged is a more extreme form of anger than simply
- [04:16] being mad. These polarities--positive versus negative,
- [04:20] high arousal versus low arousal--affect our psychological
- [04:23] states, and therefore our bodies as well. Because, you'll
- [04:26] remember that what is psychological is ultimately
- [04:29] biological. And when it comes to the physical effects of
- [04:31] our emotions, it pretty much goes the way you might
- [04:33] expect. Happiness is helpful while chronic anger or
- [04:36] depression makes us vulnerable to all kinds of problems
- [04:38] with health and well-being. The good news is that if
- [04:41] we're angry or sad, we often over-estimate the duration
- [04:44] of our bad moods and under-estimate our capacity
- [04:46] to adapt and bounce back from traumas,
- [04:48] even if things feel hopeless, depressing, or stressful
- [04:52] in the thick of it.
- [04:52] And we've all experienced stress before, sometimes on
- [04:55] a daily or even hourly basis. Much like anger or joy,
- [04:59] stress can slowly build and simmer, or it can
- [05:02] strike suddenly and with great intensity.
- [05:04] And yeah, stress, certainly the chronic or extreme type
- [05:07] can be bad for your health, but defining stress
- [05:10] is trickier than you might think.
- [05:11] Psychologists would define stress as the process by
- [05:14] which we perceive and respond to certain events, or
- [05:16] stressors, that we view as challenging or threatening.
- [05:18] In other words, stress isn't technically an emotion, it's
- [05:20] more of a reaction to a disturbing or disruptive stimulus.
- [05:24] And our reactions stem in part from our appraisal of that
- [05:27] stimulus. A person can either roll with, or get worked up
- [05:30] about a missed flight, an increased workload, or a
- [05:32] strange thump in the house. These external stressors
- [05:35] typically fall into three main categories: catastrophes, or
- [05:38] unpredictable large scale events like war, natural
- [05:42] disasters and terrorist attacks; significant life changes,
- [05:44] things like moving, having a child,  losing or getting a
- [05:47] job, or the death of a loved on; and then just everyday
- [05:50] inconveniences like getting caught in traffic, running
- [05:52] late, or feuding with your roommates.
- [05:54] Any of these stressful events, big or small, even the
- [05:56] good things, can fire up your sympathetic nervous
- [05:58] system and trigger that old fight or flight response.
- [06:01] In this way, it's important to understand that stress
- [06:03] is ultimately natural. You experience it for a reason
- [06:06] and a bit of short-lived stress can actually be a good
- [06:08] thing. It can make you active and alert when you need to
- [06:11] be, like an upcoming chemistry test might be stressing
- [06:14] you out, but that might help you find focus so you can
- [06:16] dominate that thing. And in your body, moderate stress
- [06:18] can kick the immune system into action to do things
- [06:20] like heal wounds, and fight infections. It does this by
- [06:23] triggering the release of stress hormones like
- [06:26] adrenaline and cortisol. These chemical messengers
- [06:28] are what get your organ systems to respond the way
- [06:30] you need them to when you're getting charged by a
- [06:32] bear, or focusing really hard on the gas law
- [06:35] for your chemistry test. But to also why chronic stress
- [06:38] can really wreck a body and mind, research has shown
- [06:40] that abused children have a high risk of chronic disease
- [06:43] and people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder,
- [06:46] PTSD, which we'll talk about in an upcoming episode,
- [06:48] experience higher rates of digestive, respiratory,
- [06:51] circulatory, and infectious diseases. A lot of these
- [06:54] negative connections between your body's systems
- [06:56] have to do with the fact that many of its most basic
- [06:58] functions, like blood pressure, breathing, body
- [07:01] temperature, digestion, and heartbeat, are in part
- [07:04] regulated by the autonomic nervous system.
- [07:06] We've talked before about how the sympathetic side
- [07:08] of that system cranks you up, and the parasympathetic
- [07:11] arm calms you down, but both those systems also
- [07:13] interact with the so-called "brain-in-the-gut", the enteric
- [07:16] nervous system, which helps regulate gastrointestional
- [07:19] functioning. And it's this brain-gut connection that
- [07:21] explains how stress causes digestive problems,
- [07:24] because when that werewolf pops out of the bushes
- [07:26] and a wave of cortisol washes through you, your body
- [07:28] wants to focus its energy on sending blood to your
- [07:30] muscles so that you can react quickly.
- [07:33] Which is good, right?
- [07:34] But it may do that partly by shutting down digestion
- [07:36] or decreasing the amount of digestive secretions
- [07:38] and making your colon spasm; an anxious mind can
- [07:42] lead to an anxious gut. Stress is an even bigger risk
- [07:44] factor in North America's leading cause of death:
- [07:47] heart disease, because it contributes to increased blood
- [07:50] pressure, heart rate, and cholesterol levels in a number
- [07:52] of different ways. Essentially, when your stressed out
- [07:55] nervous system is redirecting all of its energy sources to
- [07:58] your muscles and brain, it pulls flow away from your
- [08:01] other organs. And one of those organs is the liver,
- [08:03] whose job includes removing the fat and cholesterol
- [08:06] from your blood. So basically, when a stressed liver
- [08:08] can't filter properly, that extra fat and cholesterol
- [08:11] ends up circulating in your blood, which can settle
- [08:14] around the heart.
- [08:14] Don't believe me?
- [08:15] One study monitored the blood cholesterol and clotting
- [08:18] speed of 40 male tax accountants throughout the year,
- [08:20] and it found that their cholesterol and clotting rates, and
- [08:23] thus risk of heart attacks, increased dramatically during
- [08:26] the weeks before tax day as they stressed out about
- [08:30] finishing their work.
- [08:30] And physiologically speaking, it's worth pointing out that
- [08:32] some close relatives to stress, when it comes to their
- [08:35] effects on the body, are pessimism and depression,
- [08:38] which also have been linked to stress and heart
- [08:41] disease. Many types of studies have found that people
- [08:43] characterized by their optimism, happiness, love, and
- [08:46] positive feelings often live significantly longer than their
- [08:49] grumpy, dour counterparts. Researchers
- [08:51] don't quite know exactly how chronic negative emotional
- [08:54] states influence health, but it may be some combination
- [08:57] of lifestyle or behavioral factors, like neglecting your
- [09:00] health, or not taking your heart meds when you're
- [09:02] feeling blue, or social factors like the way the depression
- [09:06] can be isolating and thus prevent others from helping
- [09:08] you out. Or biological factors, like increases in certain
- [09:11] kinds of inflammatory proteins released by the immune
- [09:13] system in response to stress and sadness.
- [09:16] So in the end, while stress may not directly cause
- [09:18] disease, you could say that the two walk hand-in-hand.
- [09:21] In that way, it isn't a stretch to say that chronic stress
- [09:24] can kill, so go ahead
- [09:25] take a deep breath,
- [09:26] feel your emotions,
- [09:28] appreciate them,
- [09:29] but don't let them run your life.
- [09:30] Today, we talked more about how our emotions work
- [09:32] and how we use facial expressions to help us
- [09:34] communicate. We also looked at the 2-dimensional
- [09:37] model of emotional experience and how anger,
- [09:39] happiness, and depression can affect our health.
- [09:42] We also discussed what stress does to your nervous
- [09:44] system and how chronic stress can damage the
- [09:46] functioning of your biological systems.
