### Transcript (reading)

Way back in 1887, a journalist named Elizabeth Cochran assumed the alias Nellie Bly and feigned a mental illness to report on the truly awful conditions inside psychiatric hospitals in the US, which were known as asylums at the time. She found rotten food, cold showers, prevalent rats, abusive nurses, and patients being tied down in her famous expose "Ten Days in a Mad House". What she documented had been pretty standard mental health treatment for centuries, but her work led the charge in mental health reform. It's been a long battle. Nearly a century later in 1975, American psychologist David Rosenhan published a paper called "On Being Sane in Insane Places" detailing the experiment that he conducted on psychiatric

institutions themselves. The first part of his experiment involved sending pseudopatients - a group of eight totally mentally sound associates, including David himself - to knock on institution doors and falsely report that they'd been hearing voices. Once admitted, the fake patients abandoned their fake symptoms and behaved as they normally did, waiting for administrators to recognize them as mentally healthy. Like Cochran, Rosenhan and his team learned that it's easy to get into a mental institution, but it is much, much harder to get out. The participants were kept in the institution for an average of 19 days, one of them for 52 days. They were forced to take psychotropic medication (which they sneakily spit out) and were eventually discharged with a diagnosis

of paranoid schizophrenia in remission. Of course, being dubbed in remission isn't exactly the same thing as being labeled sane, and that was just one of Rosenhan's criticisms of the system. It viewed mental illness as an irreversible condition, almost like a personality trait, rather than a curable illness. Part two of his experiment came later when Rosenhan shared his results with a teaching hospital and then told the staff that he'd be sending more pseudopatients their way in the next few months, and challenged them to detect the imposters. With that in mind, out of 193 new patients, 41 were ferreted out as likely or suspected pseudopatients. The thing is, Rosenhan never actually sent in any pseudopatients. In the end Rosenhan concluded

that the way people were being diagnosed with psychiatric issues often revealed less about the patients themselves and more about their situation. Like, saying you've heard voices one time might catch a doctors attention a lot more than weeks of normal behavior. Naturally people criticized his methods and his findings, but his experiment raised a lot of important questions like: How do we define, diagnose, and classify mental disorders? At what point does sad become depressed? Or quirky become obsessive compulsive? Or energetic become hyperactive? What are the risks and benefits of diagnostic labeling, and how does the field keep evolving? When people think of psychology they probably most often think about the conditions that

it's been designed to understand, diagnose, and treat - namely psychological disorders. From common problems that most of us will experience at some point in our lives to the more serious dysfunctions that require intensive care. They're a big part of what psychology is here for and over the next several lessons we're going to be looking at mental illness, as well as wellness. How symptoms are diagnosed and what biological and environmental causes may be at work. But, to grasp those ideas, we first have to find out how we came to understand the idea of mental health itself and build a science around studying, discussing, and caring for it. In 2010, the World Health Organization reported that about 450 million people worldwide suffer

from some kind of mental or behavioral disorder. No society is immune from them, but when I say psychological disorder I'm guessing some of you will conjure up all sorts of dramatic images like diabolical criminals from Arkham Asylum or Hollywood stereotypes of various eccentric, scary, or tragic figures. This roll call of one-sided stock images is part of the problem our culture faces - the misconceptions and often destructive stigma associated with psychological disorders. So, what does that term actually mean? Mental health clinicians think of psychological disorders as deviant, distressful, and dysfunctional patterns of thoughts, feelings, or behaviors. And yeah, there are a lot of sensitive and loaded words in there, so let's talk about what we mean, starting with deviant.

Sounds like I'm talking about doing things that are dicey or raunchy, but in this context it's used to describe thoughts and behavior that are different from most of the rest of your cultural context. Of course, being different is usually wonderful. Geniuses and Olympians and visionaries are all deviants from the norm so it probably goes without saying that the standards for so-called deviant behavior change a lot across cultures and in different situations. For example, in a combat situation killing people is probably to be expected, but murder is definitely deviant criminal behavior back home in times of peace. And in some contexts speaking to spirits or ancestors is A-OK, but in other settings say a bar in Iowa City at happy hour it might not be quite acceptable.

But, to be classified as a disorder, that deviant behavior needs to cause that person or others around them distress, which just means a subjective feeling that something is really wrong. In turn, distress can lead to truly harmful dysfunction - when a person's ability to work and live is clearly, often measurably, impaired. So that's today's definition but it took a long time for the Western world to come up with a way of thinking about psychological disorders that was rooted in science and investigative inquiry. It wasn't until around the 18th and 19th centuries that we really started to put forth the notion that mental health issues might be about a sickness in the mind. For example, by the 1800s doctors finally caught on to the fact that advanced syphilis could

manifest in serious neurological problems like dementia, and irritability, and various mental disorders. So eventually a lot of so-called mental patients were removed from asylums to full medical hospitals where all of their symptoms could be treated. This "a-ha" moment is just one instance of how perspectives on mental health began to shift towards what is called the Medical Model of Psychological Disorder. The Medical Model champions the notion that psychological disorders have physiological causes that can be diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, and treated, and sometimes even cured. That way of thinking about mental health was an important step forward, at least at first. It took us past the old days of simply locking people up when they didn't seem quite right to others.

But even if it was an improvement, the medical model was seen by some in the field as kind of narrow and outdated. Most contemporary psychologists prefer to view mental health more comprehensively through what is called the Biopsychological Approach. You've heard us say over and over again that everything psychological is simultaneously biological and that truism is particularly useful here. The Biopsychological view takes that holistic perspective, accounting for a whole number of things clearly physiological and not in order to understand what's happening to us, what might be going wrong, and how it can be treated. It takes into account psychological influences for sure like stress and trauma and memories,

but also biological factors like genetics and brain chemistry, and social-cultural influences like all the expectations wrapped up in how a culture defines normal behavior. So by considering the whole host of nature and nurture influences, we can take a broader view of mental health, realizing that some disorders can be cured while others can be coped with, and still others may end up not being disorders at all once our culture accepts them. But another important part of handling disorders with scientific rigor is attempting to standardize and measure them. How we talk about them, how we diagnose them, and how we treat them. So the field has literally come up with a manual that shows you how to do that. But

it is not without it's flaws. It's called the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; or, DSM-5 because it's currently in its fifth edition. And it is used by practically everybody: clinicians obviously, but also by insurance and drug companies, and policy makers, and the whole legal system. The first edition came out in 1952, and this newest version was released in 2013. What's particularly interesting about it is that it's designed to be a work in progress... forever. Each new edition incorporates changes based on the latest research but also how our understanding of mental health and behavior evolves over time. For example, believe it or not the first two editions actually classified homosexuality as a pathology, basically a

disease. The 1973 third edition eliminated that designation, reflecting changing attitudes and a developing understanding of sexual orientation. And just by looking at the changes between the edition used today and the previous version released in the year 2000, you can get a picture not only of how quickly things change but also how classification can affect diagnosis - for better or worse - and also what the risks are of classifying psychological disorders in the first place. For instance, the new edition reflects our growing understanding of the symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and it changed the name of Childhood Bipolar Disorder to Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder because kids were being over-diagnosed and over-treated

for bipolar disorder when the condition that they had didn't actually fit that description. And totally new diagnoses are being explored as well, like Gambling Addiction and what's called Internet Gaming Disorder, showing that new disorders continue to arise with changing times. But the DSM is not perfect, even though we've come a long way since the Rosenhan experiment, critics still worry about how the DSM might inadvertently promote the over- or mis-diagnosis and treatment of certain behaviors. Others echo Rosenhan's concerns that by slapping patients with labels we're making them vulnerable to judgments and preconceptions that'll affect how others will perceive and treat them.

In the end, it's just important to keep in mind that definitions are powerful and things can get tricky pretty fast in the world of mental health. Today you learned about how we define psychological disorders, and looked at medical and biopsychological perspectives on mental illness. We talked about how professionals use the DSM to diagnose disorders and how it's constantly evolving to incorporate new thinking.

### Transcript (reading)

Ever heard a really good joke about polio? Or made a casual reference to someone having hepatitis? Or maybe teased your buddy by saying he has muscular dystrophy? Of course you have never done that, because you are not a terrible person. You'd never make fun of someone for having a physical illness, but folks make all kinds of offhand remarks about people having mental illnesses and never give it a second thought. How often have you heard a person say that someone's psycho, or schizo, or bipolar, or OCD? I can pretty much guarantee that the people who used those terms had no idea what they actually meant. We've talked about how psychological disorders and the people who have them have often been stigmatized.

But at the same time, we tend to minimize those disorders, using them as nicknames for things that people do, think, or say, that may not exactly be universal, but are still basically healthy. And we all do it, but only because we don't really understand those conditions. But that's why we're here, because as we go deeper into psychological disorders, we get a clearer understanding of their symptoms, types, causes, and the perspectives that help explain them. And some of the most common disorders have their root in an unpleasant mental state that's familiar to us all: anxiety. It's a part of being human, but for some people it can develop into intense fear, and paralyzing dread, and ultimately turn into full-fledged anxiety disorder.

Defining psychological disorders again: a deviant, distressful, and dysfunctional pattern of thoughts, feelings, or behaviors that interferes with the ability to function in a healthy way. So when it comes to anxiety, that definition is the difference between the guy you probably called phobic because he didn't like Space Mountain as much as you did, and the person who truly can't leave their house for fear of interacting with others. It's the difference between the girl who's teased by her friends as being OCD because she does her laundry every night and the girl who has to wash her hands so often that they bleed. Starting today, you're going to understand all of those terms you've been using.

We commonly equate anxiety with fear, but anxiety disorders aren't just a matter of fear itself. A key component is also what we do to get rid of that fear. Say someone almost drowned as a kid and is now afraid of water. A family picnic at the river may cause that anxiety to bubble up, and to cope, they may stay sequestered in the car, less anxious but probably still unhappy while the rest of the family is having fun. So, in clinical terms, anxiety disorders are characterized not only by distressing, persistent anxiety but also often by the dysfunctional behaviors that reduce that anxiety. At least a fifth of all people will experience a diagnosable anxiety disorder of some kind at some point in their lives. That is a lot of us.

So I want to start out with a condition that used to be categorized as an anxiety disorder but is now considered complex enough to be in a class by itself, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder or OCD. You probably know that condition is characterized by unwanted repetitive thoughts, which become obsessions, which are sometimes accompanied by actions, which become compulsions. And it is a great example of a psychological disorder that could use some mental-health myth busting. Being neat, and orderly, and fastidious does not make you OCD. OCD is a debilitating condition whose sufferers take normal behaviors like, washing your hands, or double checking that you turned off the stove and perform them compulsively.

And they often use these compulsive, even ritualistic behaviors to relieve intense and unbearable anxiety. So, soon they're scrubbing their hands every five minutes, or constantly checking the stove, or counting the exact number of steps they take everywhere they go. If you're still unclear about what it means for disorders to be deviant, distressful and dysfunctional, OCD might help you understand. Because it is hard to keep a job, run a household, sit still, or do much of anything if you feel intensely compelled to run to the kitchen twenty times an hour. And both the thoughts and behaviors associated with OCD are often driven by a fear that is itself obsessive, like if you don't go to the kitchen right now your house will burn down and your

child will die which makes the condition that much more distressing and self-reinforcing. There are treatments that help OCD including certain kinds of psychotherapy and some psychotropic drugs. But the key here is that it is not a description for your roommate who cleans her bathroom twice a week, or the guy in the cubicle next to you, who only likes to use green felt tip pens. And even though OCD is considered its own unique set of psychological issues, the pervasive senses of fear, worry, and loss of control that often accompany it, have a lot in common with other anxiety disorders. The broadest of these is Generalized Anxiety Disorder or GAD. People with this condition tend to feel continually tense and apprehensive, experiencing unfocused, negative, and out-of-control feelings.

Of course feeling this way occasionally is common enough, but feeling it consistently for over six months - the length of time required for a formal diagnosis - is not. Folks with GAD worry all the time and are frequently agitated and on edge, but unlike some other kinds of anxiety, patients often can't identify what's causing the anxiousness, so they don't even know what to avoid. Then there's Panic Disorder, which affects about 1 in 75 people, most often teens and young adults. It's calling card is Panic Attacks or sudden episodes of intense dread or sudden fear that come without warning. Unlike the symptoms of GAD which can be hard to pin down, Panic Attacks are brief, well-defined, and sometimes severe bouts of elevated anxiety.

And if you've ever had one, or been with someone who has, you know that they call these attacks for good reason. They can cause chest pains and racing heartbeat, difficulty breathing and a general sense that you're going crazy or even dying. It's as awful as it sounds. We've talked a lot about the body's physiological fight or flight response and that's definitely part of what's going on here, even though there often isn't an obvious trigger. There may be a genetic pre-disposition to panic disorder, but persistent stress or having experienced psychological trauma in the past can also set you up for these attacks. And because the attacks themselves can be downright terrifying, a common trigger for panic disorder is simply the fear of having another panic attack.

How's that for a kick in the head? Say you have a panic attack on a bus, or you find yourself hyperventilating in front of dozens of strangers with nowhere to go to calm yourself down, that whole ordeal might make you never want to be in that situation again, so your anxiety could lead you to start avoiding crowded or confined places. At this point the initial anxiety has spun of into a fear of anxiety which means, welcome you've migrated into another realm of anxiety disorder, Phobias. And again this is a term that's been misused for a long time to describe people who, say, they don't like cats, or are uncomfortable on long plane trips. Simply experiencing fear or discomfort doesn't make you phobic.

In clinical terms, phobias are persistent, irrational fears of specific objects, activities, or situations, that also, and this is important, leads to avoidance behavior. You hear a lot about fears of heights, or spiders, or clowns, and those are real things. They're specific phobias that focus on particular objects or situations. For example, the Chesapeake Bay Bridge in Maryland is a seven-thousand meter span that crosses the Chesapeake Bay, if you want to get to or from Eastern Maryland that's pretty much the only way to do it, at least in a car, but there are thousands of people who are so afraid of crossing that bridge that they simply can't do it. So, to accommodate this avoidance behavior, driver services are available.

For $25 people with Gephyrophobia, a fear of bridges, can hire someone to drive themselves, and their kids, and dogs, and groceries across the bridge in their own car, while trying not to freak out. But other phobias lack such specific triggers, what we might think of as social phobia, currently known as social anxiety disorder, is characterized by anxiety related to interacting or being seen by others, which could be triggered by a phone call, or being called on in class, or just thinking about meeting new people. So you can probably see at this point how anxiety disorders are related and how they can be difficult to tease apart. The same thing can be said about what we think causes them.

Because much in the same way anxiety can show up as both a feeling like panic, and a thought, like is my kitchen on fire, there are also two main perspectives on how we currently view anxiety as a function of both learning and biology. The learning perspective suggests that things like, conditioning, and observational learning and cognition, all of which we've talked about before best explain the source of our anxiety. Remember our behaviorist friend, John B. Watson and his conditioning experiments with poor little Albert, by making a loud scary noise every time you showed the kid a white rat, he ended up conditioning the boy to fear any furry object, from bunnies, to dogs, to fur coats.

That conditioning used two specific learning processes to cement itself in Little Albert's young mind. Stimulus Generalization, expanded or generalized his fear of the rat to other furry objects, the same principle holds true if you were, like, attacked by your neighbours mean parrot and subsequently fear all birds. But then the anxiety is solidified through reinforcement, every time you avoid or escape a feared situations, a pair of fuzzy slippers or a robin on the street, you ease your anxiety, which might make you feel better temporarily, but it actually reinforces your phobic behavior, making it stronger. Cognition also influences our anxiety, whether we interpret a strange noise outside as a hungry bear, or a robber, or merely the wind, determines if we roll-over and keep snoring,

or freak out and run for a kitchen knife. And we might also acquire anxiety from other people through observational learning. A parent who's terrified of water may end up instilling that fear in their child by violently snatching them away from kiddie pools or generally acting anxious around park fountains and duck ponds. But there're also equally important biological perspectives. Natural selection, for instance, might explain why we seem to fear certain potentially dangerous animals, like snakes, or why fears of heights or closed in spaces are relatively common. It's probably true that our more wary ancestors who had the sense to stay away from cliff edges and hissing serpents were more likely to live another day and pass along their genes,

so this might explain why those fears can persist, and why even people who live in places without poisonous snakes would still fear snakes anyway. And then you got the genetics and the brain chemistry to consider. Research has shown for example that identical twins, those eternal test subjects, are more likely to develop phobias even if they're raised apart. Some researchers have detected seventeen different genes that seem to be expressed with various anxiety disorders. So it may be that some folks are just naturally more anxious than others and they might pass on that quality to their kids. And of course individual brains have a lot to say about how they process anxiety.

Physiologically, people who experience panic attacks, generalized anxiety, or obsessive compulsions show over-arousal in the areasof the brain that deal in impulse control and habitual behaviors. Now we don't know whether these irregularities cause the disorder or are caused by it, but again, it reinforces the truism that everything that is psychological is simultaneously biological. And that holds true for many other psychological disorders we'll talk about in the coming weeks, many of which have names that you've also heard being misused in the past. Today you learned what defines an anxiety disorder, as well as the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder and phobias.

You also learned about the two main perspectives on the origins of anxiety disorders, the learning perspective and the biological perspective and hopefully you learned not to use "OCD" as a punch line from now on.

### Transcript (navigation)

- [00:00] Ever heard a really good joke about polio? Or made a casual reference to someone having
- [00:04] hepatitis? Or maybe teased your buddy by saying he has muscular dystrophy?
- [00:08] Of course you have never done that, because you are not a terrible person. You'd never
- [00:11] make fun of someone for having a physical illness, but folks make all kinds of offhand
- [00:15] remarks about people having mental illnesses and never give it a second thought.
- [00:19] How often have you heard a person say that someone's psycho, or schizo, or bipolar, or
- [00:23] OCD? I can pretty much guarantee that the people who used those terms had no idea what they actually meant.
- [00:29] We've talked about how psychological disorders and the people who have them have often  been stigmatized.
- [00:34] But at the same time, we tend to minimize those disorders, using them as nicknames for
- [00:38] things that people do, think, or say, that may not exactly be universal, but are still basically healthy.
- [00:44] And we all do it, but only because we don't really understand those conditions.
- [00:48] But that's why we're here, because as we go deeper into psychological disorders, we get
- [00:53] a clearer understanding of their symptoms, types, causes, and the perspectives that help explain them.
- [00:58] And some of the most common disorders have their root in an unpleasant mental state that's
- [01:02] familiar to us all: anxiety.
- [01:04] It's a part of being human, but for some people it can develop into intense fear, and paralyzing
- [01:09] dread, and ultimately turn into full-fledged anxiety disorder.
- [01:13] Defining psychological disorders again: a deviant, distressful, and dysfunctional pattern
- [01:18] of thoughts, feelings, or behaviors that interferes with the ability to function in a healthy way.
- [01:23] So when it comes to anxiety, that definition is the difference between the guy you probably
- [01:27] called phobic because he didn't like Space Mountain as much as you did, and the person
- [01:31] who truly can't leave their house for fear of interacting with others.
- [01:35] It's the difference between the girl who's teased by her friends as being OCD because
- [01:39] she does her laundry every night and the girl who has to wash her hands so often that they bleed.
- [01:43] Starting today, you're going to understand all of those terms you've been using.
- [01:56] We commonly equate anxiety with fear, but anxiety disorders aren't just a matter of fear itself.
- [02:00] A key component is also what we do to get rid of that fear.
- [02:04] Say someone almost drowned as a kid and is now afraid of water.
- [02:07] A family picnic at the river may cause that anxiety to bubble up, and to cope, they may
- [02:12] stay sequestered in the car, less anxious but probably still unhappy while the rest
- [02:16] of the family is having fun.
- [02:17] So, in clinical terms, anxiety disorders are characterized not only by distressing, persistent
- [02:22] anxiety but also often by the dysfunctional behaviors that reduce that anxiety.
- [02:27] At least a fifth of all people will experience a diagnosable anxiety disorder of some kind
- [02:32] at some point in their lives. That is a lot of us.
- [02:36] So I want to start out with a condition that used to be categorized as an anxiety disorder
- [02:39] but is now considered complex enough to be in a class by itself, Obsessive-Compulsive
- [02:43] Disorder or OCD.
- [02:45] You probably know that condition is characterized by unwanted repetitive thoughts, which become
- [02:49] obsessions, which are sometimes accompanied by actions, which become compulsions.
- [02:54] And it is a great example of a psychological disorder that could use some mental-health myth busting.
- [02:58] Being neat, and orderly, and fastidious does not make you OCD.
- [03:03] OCD is a debilitating condition whose sufferers take normal behaviors like, washing your hands,
- [03:08] or double checking that you turned off the stove and perform them compulsively.
- [03:12] And they often use these compulsive, even ritualistic behaviors to relieve intense and unbearable anxiety.
- [03:18] So, soon they're scrubbing their hands every five minutes, or constantly checking the stove,
- [03:22] or counting the exact number of steps they take everywhere they go.
- [03:25] If you're still unclear about what it means for disorders to be deviant, distressful and
- [03:29] dysfunctional, OCD might help you understand.
- [03:32] Because it is hard to keep a job, run a household, sit still, or do much of anything if you feel
- [03:37] intensely compelled to run to the kitchen twenty times an hour.
- [03:41] And both the thoughts and behaviors associated with OCD are often driven by a fear that is itself
- [03:46] obsessive, like if you don't go to the kitchen right now your house will burn down and your
- [03:49] child will die which makes the condition that much more distressing and self-reinforcing.
- [03:53] There are treatments that help OCD including certain kinds of psychotherapy and some psychotropic drugs.
- [03:58] But the key here is that it is not a description for your roommate who cleans her bathroom
- [04:02] twice a week, or the guy in the cubicle next to you, who only likes to use green felt tip pens.
- [04:06] And even though OCD is considered its own unique set of psychological issues, the pervasive
- [04:10] senses of fear, worry, and loss of control that often accompany it, have a lot in common
- [04:15] with other anxiety disorders.
- [04:17] The broadest of these is Generalized Anxiety Disorder or GAD.
- [04:22] People with this condition tend to feel continually tense and apprehensive, experiencing unfocused,
- [04:27] negative, and out-of-control feelings.
- [04:29] Of course feeling this way occasionally is common enough, but feeling it consistently
- [04:32] for over six months - the length of time required for a formal diagnosis - is not.
- [04:37] Folks with GAD worry all the time and are frequently agitated and on edge, but unlike
- [04:42] some other kinds of anxiety, patients often can't identify what's causing the anxiousness, so
- [04:47] they don't even know what to avoid.
- [04:48] Then there's Panic Disorder, which affects about 1 in 75 people, most often teens and young adults.
- [04:54] It's calling card is Panic Attacks or sudden episodes of intense dread or sudden fear that
- [04:59] come without warning.
- [05:01] Unlike the symptoms of GAD which can be hard to pin down, Panic Attacks are brief, well-defined,
- [05:06] and sometimes severe bouts of elevated anxiety.
- [05:09] And if you've ever had one, or been with someone who has, you know that they call these attacks
- [05:13] for good reason.
- [05:15] They can cause chest pains and racing heartbeat, difficulty breathing and a general sense that
- [05:20] you're going crazy or even dying. It's as awful as it sounds.
- [05:23] We've talked a lot about the body's physiological fight or flight response and that's definitely
- [05:27] part of what's going on here, even though there often isn't an obvious trigger.
- [05:31] There may be a genetic pre-disposition to panic disorder, but persistent stress or having
- [05:35] experienced psychological trauma in the past can also set you up for these attacks.
- [05:39] And because the attacks themselves can be downright terrifying, a common trigger for
- [05:43] panic disorder is simply the fear of having another panic attack.
- [05:48] How's that for a kick in the head?
- [05:49] Say you have a panic attack on a bus, or you find yourself hyperventilating in front of
- [05:52] dozens of strangers with nowhere to go to calm yourself down, that whole ordeal might
- [05:56] make you never want to be in that situation again, so your anxiety could lead you to start
- [06:00] avoiding crowded or confined places.
- [06:01] At this point the initial anxiety has spun of into a fear of anxiety which means, welcome
- [06:07] you've migrated into another realm of anxiety disorder, Phobias.
- [06:11] And again this is a term that's been misused for a long time to describe people who, say,
- [06:14] they don't like cats, or are uncomfortable on long plane trips.
- [06:18] Simply experiencing fear or discomfort doesn't make you phobic.
- [06:22] In clinical terms, phobias are persistent, irrational fears of specific objects, activities,
- [06:27] or situations, that also, and this is important, leads to avoidance behavior.
- [06:32] You hear a lot about fears of heights, or spiders, or clowns, and those are real things.
- [06:37] They're specific phobias that focus on particular objects or situations.
- [06:41] For example, the Chesapeake Bay Bridge in Maryland is a seven-thousand meter span that

- [06:49] much the only way to do it, at least in a car, but there are thousands of people who
- [06:54] are so afraid of crossing that bridge that they simply can't do it.

### Transcript (reading)

American psychologist, and professor of psychiatry, Kay Redfield Jamison, is one of the world's foremost authorities on bipolar disorder. She's spent her career researching, lecturing, and writing seminal books on the condition. A condition that she also happens to have had her entire adult life. In her memoir, "An Unquiet Mind," Jamison details what it really means to be bipolar. She writes of not sleeping for days on end, of feeling long periods of euphoria, and filling whole notebooks with her racing thoughts and grandiose ideas. While in these manic states, she experienced a tremendously inflated sense of self-esteem and did impulsive things that felt good at the time but had painful consequences, like

going on lavish shopping sprees, engaging in promiscuous behavior, racking up credit card debt, and emptying her bank accounts. But these episodes were followed by emotional crashes: Crippling bouts of depression that sent her into a suicidal spiral. At the age of 28, Jamison tried to kill herself by taking an overdose of Lithium, lapsed into a coma, but thankfully emerged from it determined to find help through medication and therapy. Through her research and writing, Dr. Jamison has pioneered our understanding of bipolar disorder, depression, and the nexus of mental struggles that we now think of as mood disorders. And she's probably one of the best ambassadors we have for all those people who live successful, productive lives with mental illness.

Just like the anxiety disorders we talked about last time, mood disorders are misunderstood. They're diluted by depictions of depression as something that can be treated with one day at a spa or descriptions of people as manic depressive just because they were sad yesterday and aren't today. As students of psychology, our job is to understand what mood disorders really are, how they manifest themselves, and what might cause them. And as you probably guessed, this can be pretty tough terrain to explore. These disorders can take people from terrifying highs to pits of despair that seem all but bottomless. But! In between there's what Jamison has called, "A rich, imaginative life" -- all made possible by your moods.

We've been talking a lot about terms and concepts that mean something different than what you think they mean, but this time, the term "Mood" is not one of those. In a psychological context, moods are pretty much exactly what you think they are: Emotional states that are even more subjective and harder to define than the emotions themselves. And while psychologists have defined about 10 basic emotions, moods tend to fall into two broadly and infinitely variable categories. You got the good moods and the bad moods. Probably the most important distinction between emotion and mood is that moods are long-term emotional states rather than discreet, fleeting feelings. And "mood-disorders," which are characterized by emotional extremes and challenges in regulating

mood tend to be longer-term disturbances. These include depressive disorders, typified by prolonged hopelessness and lethargy, and bipolar disorders, the most prominent of which involve alternating between depression and mania. Depression has been called the common cold of psychological disorders. Which is not to say that it isn't serious, but it's common and it's pervasive and it's the top reason people seek out mental health help. We've all felt down before, obviously, often in response to a specific loss: a breakup or a lost job or the death of a loved one. And the fact is, you probably should feel bad at times like those. It can actually be good for a mind and body to slow down, to help digest losses that you experience, but

in general, sadness is temporary. It's when sadness and grief extend beyond the generally accepted social norms, or plunge into a depth that causes serious dysfunction that you find yourself in the territory of depressive disorders. The DSM-5, our handy (if super flawed) user's guide to psychological disorders officially diagnoses a major depressive disorder when a patient has experienced at least five signs of depression for more than two weeks. These symptoms include not just depressed mood, but also significant weight or appetite loss or gain, too much or too little sleep, decreased interest in activities, feeling worthless, fatigued, or lethargic, difficulty concentrating or making decisions, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide.

So while everyone experiences sadness, depression is a physiological as well as psychological illness. It messes with your sleep, and appetite, and energy, and neurotransmitter levels, all interfering with the way your body runs itself. Plus in keeping with our definition of psychological disorders, to be considered a true disorder this behavior needs to cause the person or others around them prolonged distress - the feeling that something is really wrong. Just as a person with a severe, generalized anxiety disorder may never want to leave the house, a clinically depressed person often feels so hopeless and overwhelmed that they have trouble living a normal life. And unlike the bipolar disorders, the depressive disorders tend to be all lows.

You've probably heard of manic depression. It's the outdated term for bipolar disorders. These include those classic dark lows of depression, but also bouts of the opposite - of extreme mania in more severe cases. Someone suffering from a bipolar disorder may flip back and forth between normal and depressive and manic phases within a single day or week or month. And a true manic episode doesn't just mean being energetic or happy, it's a period of intense, restless, but often optimistic hyperactivity in which your estimation of yourself and your abilities and your ideas can often get skewed. Like, really, REALLY skewed. Some patients experience mania only rarely, but when they do, it can be destructive. Kay Jamison has testified to that.

Once during a manic episode, she bought up a drug store's entire supply of snake-bite kits, convinced of an imminent attack of rattlesnakes that only she knew was coming. In another, she purchased 20 books by the Penguin Publishing House because she said, "It could be nice if the penguins could form a colony." In other words, bad judgment is common. And it can get worse. Full blown manic episodes often end up in psychiatric hospitalization, since the risk to self or others can become severe. When the highs eventually end, they're often followed by dark periods of depression. When left untreated, suicide or suicide attempts are common, another element of the disorder that Jamison herself can attest to.

Like so many things in psychology, the cause of mood disorders is often a combination of biological, genetic, psychological, and environmental factors. We know, for example, that mood disorders run in families - genes matter. And you're more likely to experience a bipolar or depressive disorder if you have parents or siblings who suffer from them. Studies have of identical twins show that if one twin has a bipolar disorder, that the other has a seven in ten chance of also being diagnosed, regardless of whether they were raised together or apart. And while a stressful life can't give you bipolar disorder, it could trigger a manic or depressive episode in someone with a pre-existing condition. Or start a descent into a major

depressive episode in someone who never before had experienced depression. In other words, a person who loses a loved one could go from sad to depressed or slide into a bipolar episode, but it couldn't cause them to have the disorder to begin with. In the case of depressive disorders, for most people, after weeks, months, or even years, their depression can end, hopefully with the return to baseline healthy functioning. World-wide, women tend to be diagnosed with major depression more often than men, but many psychologists think this is simply because women tend to seek treatment more. It's also possible that depression in men tends to manifest itself more in terms of anger and aggression, than as sadness and hopelessness.

This is just an example of how depression is much more than just being sad and that the characteristic lack of purpose and helplessness can manifest itself in a lot of different ways. Looking at mood disorders from a neurological perspective, we see that depressed, manic, and average brains show very different brain activity in neural imaging scans. As you might expect, a brain in a depressed state slows down. While a brain in a manic state shows a lot of increased activity, making it hard for that person to calm down or focus or sleep. Our brain's neurotransmitter chemistry also changes with these different states. For example, norepinephrine, which usually increases arousal and focus, is severely lacking in depressed

brains, but kind of off the charts during manic episodes. In fact, drugs that seek to reduce mania in part do it by reducing norepinephrine levels. You may have also heard about how low serotonin levels correlate with depressive states. Exercise, like jogging or break dancing or whatever, increases serotonin levels, which is one reason exercise is often recommended to combat depression. And most medications designed to treat depression seem to work by raising serotonin or norepinephrine levels. And of course there's yet another way to look at things. The social-cognitive perspective examines how our thinking and behavior influence depression. People with depression often view bad events through an internal lens or mind set that

influences how they're interpreted. And how you explain events to yourself, in a negative or positive way, can really effect how you recover from them - or don't. Say you were humiliated in the lunch room when someone tripped you and chicken soup flew all over the place, and you sat down on a brownie, and it was just a bad day. A depressive mind might immediately start thinking that the humiliation will last forever, that no one will ever let you live it down, that it's somehow your own fault, and you can't ever do anything right. That negative thinking, learned helplessness, self-blame, and over-thinking can feed off itself and basically smother the joy out of the brain, eventually creating a vicious self-fulfilling cycle of negative thinking.

The good news is that the cycle can be broken by getting help from a professional, turning your attention outward, doing more fun things, and maybe even moving to a different environment. But again, that social-cognitive prospective is just part of a much bigger puzzle. Positive thinking is important, but it's often inadequate on its own own when up against genetic or neurological factors.

### Transcript (navigation)

- [00:00] American psychologist, and professor of psychiatry, Kay Redfield Jamison, is one of the world's
- [00:04] foremost authorities on bipolar disorder. She's spent her career researching, lecturing,
- [00:09] and writing seminal books on the condition.
- [00:11] A condition that she also happens to have had her entire adult life.
- [00:15] In her memoir, "An Unquiet Mind," Jamison details what it really means to be bipolar.
- [00:20] She writes of not sleeping for days on end, of feeling long periods of euphoria, and filling
- [00:25] whole notebooks with her racing thoughts and grandiose ideas.
- [00:29] While in these manic states, she experienced a tremendously inflated sense of self-esteem
- [00:33] and did impulsive things that felt good at the time but had painful consequences, like
- [00:37] going on lavish shopping sprees, engaging in promiscuous behavior, racking up credit
- [00:42] card debt, and emptying her bank accounts.
- [00:44] But these episodes were followed by emotional crashes: Crippling bouts of depression that
- [00:48] sent her into a suicidal spiral. At the age of 28, Jamison tried to kill herself by taking
- [00:53] an overdose of Lithium, lapsed into a coma, but thankfully emerged from it determined
- [00:57] to find help through medication and therapy.
- [00:59] Through her research and writing, Dr. Jamison has pioneered our understanding of bipolar
- [01:03] disorder, depression, and the nexus of mental struggles that we now think of as mood disorders.
- [01:08] And she's probably one of the best ambassadors we have for all those people who live successful,
- [01:13] productive lives with mental illness.
- [01:15] Just like the anxiety disorders we talked about last time, mood disorders are misunderstood.
- [01:19] They're diluted by depictions of depression as something that can be treated with one
- [01:23] day at a spa or descriptions of people as manic depressive just because they were sad
- [01:27] yesterday and aren't today.
- [01:29] As students of psychology, our job is to understand what mood disorders really are, how they manifest
- [01:33] themselves, and what might cause them. And as you probably guessed, this can be pretty
- [01:37] tough terrain to explore. These disorders can take people from terrifying highs to pits
- [01:42] of despair that seem all but bottomless.
- [01:44] But! In between there's what Jamison has called,  "A rich, imaginative life"
- [01:48] -- all made possible by your moods.
- [02:01] We've been talking a lot about terms and concepts that mean something different than what you
- [02:03] think they mean, but this time, the term "Mood" is not one of those.
- [02:07] In a psychological context, moods are pretty much exactly what you think they are: Emotional
- [02:11] states that are even more subjective and harder to define than the emotions themselves.
- [02:16] And while psychologists have defined about 10 basic emotions, moods tend to fall
- [02:20] into two broadly and infinitely variable categories. You got the good moods and the bad moods.
- [02:26] Probably the most important distinction between emotion and mood is that moods are long-term
- [02:31] emotional states rather than discreet, fleeting feelings.
- [02:34] And "mood-disorders," which are characterized by emotional extremes and challenges in regulating
- [02:39] mood tend to be longer-term disturbances.
- [02:42] These include depressive disorders, typified by prolonged hopelessness and lethargy, and
- [02:46] bipolar disorders, the most prominent of which involve alternating between depression and mania.
- [02:50] Depression has been called the common cold of psychological disorders. Which is not to
- [02:54] say that it isn't serious, but it's common and it's pervasive and it's the top reason
- [02:58] people seek out mental health help.
- [03:00] We've all felt down before, obviously, often in response to a specific loss: a breakup
- [03:05] or a lost job or the death of a loved one.
- [03:07] And the fact is, you probably should feel bad at times like those. It can actually be
- [03:11] good for a mind and body to slow down, to help digest losses that you experience, but
- [03:16] in general, sadness is temporary. It's when sadness and grief extend beyond the generally
- [03:20] accepted social norms, or plunge into a depth that causes serious dysfunction that you find
- [03:25] yourself in the territory of depressive disorders.
- [03:28] The DSM-5, our handy (if super flawed) user's guide to psychological disorders officially
- [03:32] diagnoses a major depressive disorder when a patient has experienced at least five signs
- [03:37] of depression for more than two weeks.
- [03:39] These symptoms include not just depressed mood, but also significant weight or appetite
- [03:44] loss or gain, too much or too little sleep, decreased interest in activities, feeling
- [03:48] worthless, fatigued, or lethargic, difficulty concentrating or making decisions, and recurrent
- [03:53] thoughts of death or suicide.
- [03:55] So while everyone experiences sadness, depression is a physiological as well as psychological
- [04:00] illness. It messes with your sleep, and appetite, and energy, and neurotransmitter levels, all
- [04:05] interfering with the way your body runs itself.
- [04:07] Plus in keeping with our definition of psychological disorders, to be considered a true disorder
- [04:11] this behavior needs to cause the person or others around them prolonged distress - the
- [04:16] feeling that something is really wrong.
- [04:19] Just as a person with a severe, generalized anxiety disorder may never want to leave the
- [04:22] house, a clinically depressed person often feels so hopeless and overwhelmed that they
- [04:26] have trouble living a normal life. And unlike the bipolar disorders, the depressive disorders
- [04:30] tend to be all lows.
- [04:31] You've probably heard of manic depression. It's the outdated term for bipolar disorders.
- [04:36] These include those classic dark lows of depression, but also bouts of the opposite - of extreme
- [04:41] mania in more severe cases. Someone suffering from a bipolar disorder may flip back and
- [04:45] forth between normal and depressive and manic phases within a single day or week or month.
- [04:50] And a true manic episode doesn't just mean being energetic or happy, it's a period of
- [04:54] intense, restless, but often optimistic hyperactivity in which your estimation of yourself and your
- [05:00] abilities and your ideas can often get skewed. Like, really, REALLY skewed.
- [05:05] Some patients experience mania only rarely, but when they do, it can be destructive. Kay
- [05:09] Jamison has testified to that.
- [05:11] Once during a manic episode, she bought up a drug store's entire supply of snake-bite
- [05:15] kits, convinced of an imminent attack of rattlesnakes that only she knew was coming.
- [05:19] In another, she purchased 20 books by the Penguin Publishing House because she said,
- [05:24] "It could be nice if the penguins could form a colony."
- [05:27] In other words, bad judgment is common. And it can get worse.
- [05:31] Full blown manic episodes often end up in psychiatric hospitalization, since the risk
- [05:35] to self or others can become severe. When the highs eventually end, they're often followed
- [05:40] by dark periods of depression. When left untreated, suicide or suicide attempts are common, another
- [05:45] element of the disorder that Jamison herself can attest to.
- [05:48] Like so many things in psychology, the cause of mood disorders is often a combination of
- [05:52] biological, genetic, psychological, and environmental factors. We know, for example, that mood disorders
- [05:57] run in families - genes matter. And you're more likely to experience a bipolar or depressive
- [06:03] disorder if you have parents or siblings who suffer from them.
- [06:05] Studies have of identical twins show that if one twin has a bipolar disorder, that the
- [06:09] other has a seven in ten chance of also being diagnosed, regardless of whether they were
- [06:13] raised together or apart.
- [06:15] And while a stressful life can't give you bipolar disorder, it could trigger a manic
- [06:20] or depressive episode in someone with a pre-existing condition. Or start a descent into a major
- [06:24] depressive episode in someone who never before had experienced depression. In other words,
- [06:27] a person who loses a loved one could go from sad to depressed or slide into a bipolar episode,
- [06:32] but it couldn't cause them to have the disorder to begin with.
- [06:35] In the case of depressive disorders, for most people, after weeks, months, or even years,
- [06:40] their depression can end, hopefully with the return to baseline healthy functioning.
- [06:44] World-wide, women tend to be diagnosed with major depression more often than men, but
- [06:48] many psychologists think this is simply because women tend to seek treatment more. It's also
- [06:51] possible that depression in men tends to manifest itself more in terms of anger and aggression,
- [06:56] than as sadness and hopelessness.
- [06:57] This is just an example of how depression is much more than just being sad and that
- [07:01] the characteristic lack of purpose and helplessness can manifest itself in a lot of different ways.
- [07:05] Looking at mood disorders from a neurological perspective, we see that depressed, manic,
- [07:09] and average brains show very different brain activity in neural imaging scans. As you might
- [07:14] expect, a brain in a depressed state slows down. While a brain in a manic state shows
- [07:18] a lot of increased activity, making it hard for that person to calm down or focus or sleep.
- [07:23] Our brain's neurotransmitter chemistry also changes with these different states. For example,
- [07:27] norepinephrine, which usually increases arousal and focus, is severely lacking in depressed
- [07:31] brains, but kind of off the charts during manic episodes. In fact, drugs that seek to
- [07:36] reduce mania in part do it by reducing norepinephrine levels. You may have also heard about how
- [07:41] low serotonin levels correlate with depressive states. Exercise, like jogging or break dancing
- [07:47] or whatever, increases serotonin levels, which is one reason exercise is often recommended
- [07:51] to combat depression. And most medications designed to treat depression seem to work
- [07:55] by raising serotonin or norepinephrine levels.
- [07:58] And of course there's yet another way to look at things. The social-cognitive perspective
- [08:02] examines how our thinking and behavior influence depression.
- [08:05] People with depression often view bad events through an internal lens or mind set that
- [08:09] influences how they're interpreted. And how you explain events to yourself, in a negative
- [08:14] or positive way, can really effect how you recover from them - or don't.
- [08:18] Say you were humiliated in the lunch room when someone tripped you and chicken soup
- [08:21] flew all over the place, and you sat down on a brownie, and it was just a bad day. A
- [08:25] depressive mind might immediately start thinking that the humiliation will last forever, that
- [08:29] no one will ever let you live it down, that it's somehow your own fault, and you can't
- [08:33] ever do anything right.
- [08:34] That negative thinking, learned helplessness, self-blame, and over-thinking can feed off
- [08:39] itself and basically smother the joy out of the brain, eventually creating a vicious self-fulfilling
- [08:44] cycle of negative thinking.
- [08:46] The good news is that the cycle can be broken by getting help from a professional, turning
- [08:49] your attention outward, doing more fun things, and maybe even moving to a different environment.
- [08:54] But again, that social-cognitive prospective is just part of a much bigger puzzle. Positive
- [08:58] thinking is important, but it's often inadequate on its own own when up against genetic or neurological factors.
- [09:03] So mood disorders are complicated conditions and rarely are they eliminated with a single
- [09:07] cure. Instead, they're often things you just live with. And as Dr. Jamison has shown us,
- [09:12] you can live well.

All right, so you might have read "The Hobbit" or "The Lord of the Rings," you have probably seen them, you've definitely heard of them. But not everyone knows the story of their author, J.R.R. Tolkien. Tolkien was an English World War One veteran. A reluctant solider, he joined up with a sense of duty and he lived through the bloody battle of Somme suffering tremendous shock, guilt, and loss during and after the war. It took Tolkien years to processes his experiences. To help him do it he turned to writing fiction and in time he constructed a world that helped him and all of us better understand war, human nature, loss, and growth. His novels were the bi-product of trauma and they're among the more beautiful reminders of how it can affect us.

Most of us will experience some kind of traumatic event in our lives and most of us will exhibit some kind of stress related behavior because of it, these symptoms usually fade but for some those reactions can linger and start of disrupt their lives or the lives of those around them. These reactions can develop into full blown psychological disorders including post-traumatic stress disorder and, in an effort to cope, sometimes addiction, but it doesn't always have to be that way. Ultimately, Tolkien was able to harness the effect of his trauma and shape them into something important and to reclaim is own life because there is such a thing as post-traumatic growth, too. As it does with many other things psychology approaches trauma related disorders with different

perspectives, but they all tend to ask the same questions. How do you identify and diagnose these disorders? And how do you treat them, so that the patients can recover? -- With the understanding that they might never be the same as they were before the trauma, but they can still be healthy and happy. In a way, psychology helps patients ask themselves, what Tolkien asks his readers, and what Frodo asks when he is finally safe back in the shire: "How do you pick up the threads of an old life? How to go on, when in your heart, you begin to understand that there is no going back." It could be September 11 or a serious car accident or a natural disaster or a violent crime that you survived but are still haunted by. Trauma comes in many different forms and sometimes it can stick with you.

When it manifests as nightmares, flashbacks, avoidance, fear, guilt, anxiety, rage, insomnia, and begins to interfere with your ability to function it can come to be known as post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD. It was once call "shell shock" a term used to describe the condition of veterans, like Tolkien in World War One but PTSD isn't limited to veterans. It's defined as a psychological disorder generated by either witnessing or experiencing a traumatic event. Its symptoms are classified into four major clusters in the DSM V. One of these clusters involves re-living the event through intrusive memories, nightmares, or flashbacks. The second involves avoiding situations you associate with the event, while

the third generally describes excessive physiological arousal like heart pounding, muscle tension, anxiety or irritability, and major problems sleeping or concentrating. And finally we have the fourth major symptom cluster: pervasive negative changes in emotions and belief, like feelings in excessive guilt, fear, or shame -- or no longer getting enjoyment out of what you used to. PTSD patients may also experience numbing, or periods of feeling emotionless or emotionally "flat" and dissociation, feeling as if situations aren't real or are surreal, feeling like time has slowed down or sped up, or even blacking out. We have been discussing how anxiety or mood disorders can affect a person's ability to function and how that impairment itself leads to more suffering and dysfunction.

When any of these disorders is left untreated suffers may start to feel desperate to find some way to cope and one way may be substance abuse. Unfortunately, addiction and trauma can go hand in hand and it can be hard to recover from one without also dealing with the other. According to the US department of Veteran's Affairs more than 2 in 10 veterans with PTSD also struggle with substance abuse problems and 1 in every 3 vets seeking treatment for substance abuse also have PTSD. And across many studies, between a third to a half of women in treatment for substance abuse have experienced rape or sexual assault. For a long time most psychologists understood PTSD through the lens of fear conditioning or the unshakable memory of being in mortal danger and the learned responses that stem

from that memory. But clinicians have also begun to recognize that for some the disorder can also be a kind of moral injury, widening the focus to include hauntings not just of violence done to a person but also what that person did or did not do to others. Brandon was a combat drone operator in the air force he enlisted at 21 years old and spent 6 years sitting in a bunker in the American South-West watching Iraq and Afghanistan from surveillance drones. He watched soldiers die and people get executed. He also watched kids play, people get married, goats grazing -- and when the time came he ordered hell fire missiles to strike military targets or people who had no idea they where even being watched.

Although he was half a world away from combat, he ultimately suffered the psychological trauma felt by many on the ground soldiers. He was diagnosed with PTSD. Brandon suffers no fears for his own safety, but still experiences the same intrusive memories, nightmares, depression, anxiety, and substance abuse of many emotionally traumatized combat soldiers. So do a lot of other drone operators. But why do some victims or trauma suffer from PTSD while others seem able to move on? Well, its psychology so the risk factors are complicated. Some findings suggest that there may be genetic predispositions making some people more vulnerable than others. We also know that context and environment matter, for instance, someone who has experienced

childhood abuse might feel on the one hand more ready to deal with difficult and traumatic experiences. But on the other hand they might be more likely to default to the suppression and avoidance in which PTSD suffers frequently engage, which as we've discussed in previous episodes often makes psychiatric symptoms worsen over time. As far as whats going on in the brain, PTSD shares some similarities with anxiety disorders. For example the brains limbic system may flood the body with waves of stress hormones like cortisol every time images of the traumatic event bubble up uninvited into consciousness. And we've already talked a lot about how the amygdala and hippocampus are involved in those classic fight or flight reactions, which when prolonged can be really rough on the body.

In fact, neuroimaging suggests that trauma -- or the chemical processes set into motion by trauma -- might actually damage and shrink the hippocampus. Since this region is also associated with how we consolidate memories, this might explain how memories associated with trauma could fail to be filed away as long-term memories and instead remain vivid and fresh through flashbacks and nightmares. If there's any silver lining to all of this, it's that some people may actually experience positive change after a trauma. Treatment and social support help some suffers achieve post-traumatic growth, positive psychological changes resulting from the struggle with challenging circumstances and life crises.

That's in part what Tolkien did. Though he suffered great trauma and loss on the battlefield, he was eventually able to use those experiences to drive those powerful, allegorical stories. Stories that helped not just himself, but many readers of all ages around the world. It seems that while whatever doesn't kill you might not necessarily make you stronger, sometimes it really does. But suffering can feed on itself. Many victims of trauma try to cope through whats colloquially called self-medicating and some can end up with substance abuse or dependence issues. Psychologists define addiction or dependence as compulsive, excessive, and difficult-to-control substance use, or other, initially pleasurable behavior that beings to interfere with ordinary life, work, health, or relationships.

This could mean over-consuming drugs or alcohol, or compulsively gambling, eating, shopping, exercising, or having sex. People with addictions may not even realize that they have lost control of their behavior for some time. Addiction can refer to a physical dependence, a physiological need for a drug, that reveals itself through terrible withdrawal symptoms if the use stops or reduces. Or psychological dependence, the need to use that drug, or complete that activity in order to relieve negative emotions. People with addiction can sometimes be stigmatized as pleasure-bound hedonists who have no self-control, but people often compulsively use substances or do things in reaction to stress and other psychological problems. For various reasons they have been prevented from coping in other

ways or maybe they just never learned how. So in this way addiction itself is often secondary to the more complicated matter of how a person deals with stress and difficult emotions, or what kinds of stressful situations they've survived. Few will dispute that much of what makes addiction possible is chemistry, but people are different -- from their life experiences to their biological sensitivities. So people respond in different way to different drugs and behaviors. Many people can drink casually or gamble once in a while without losing control. Others simply can't. People in recovery from addiction may also have different needs. Some will need to be completely sober and never again touch that drug or do that thing. While others may in

time be able to regain enough control to use again in moderation. Likewise, some folks can kick the habit on their own while others do better with or need support from professionals or support groups. Researchers and groups like Alcoholics Anonymous debate whether addiction is a mental illness -- like a "software problem" related to thoughts, and behaviors, and feelings -- or a physical disease -- a "hard wire problem" related to biology and genetics -- or both, and even whether addiction and dependence are the same thing. Either way it can be hard to recover from an addiction if you don't get the underlying problem treated. But some people believe that you can't treat the underlying problem without first getting the addiction out of the way.

While this controversy too continues, many are moving toward a model of treating both at at the same time. The so-called Dual Diagnosis Model of treatment. Addiction that's rooted in deeper psychological issues -- especially in emotional trauma like PTSD -- often require some version of dual treatment to untangle both issues. The good news is while PTSD and substance dependence may be distressing and complex, people can begin to heal given the chance and the resources. We're amazingly resilient creatures. When nurtured with the proper support and practice, we can overcome a lot. Today we talked about the causes and symptoms of PTSD and how trauma can affect the brain. We also looked at addiction, physical and psychological dependence, the relationship

between trauma and addiction, and why they can require dual treatment, and we touched on post-traumatic growth with the wisdom of Frodo Baggins.

- [04:16] can also be a kind of moral injury, widening the focus to include hauntings not just of
- [04:21] violence done to a person but also what that person did or did not do to others.
- [04:26] Brandon was a combat drone operator in the air force he enlisted at 21 years old and
- [04:30] spent 6 years sitting in a bunker in the American South-West watching Iraq and Afghanistan from
- [04:36] surveillance drones.
- [04:37] He watched soldiers die and people get executed. He also watched kids play, people get married,
- [04:42] goats grazing -- and when the time came he ordered hell fire missiles to strike military
- [04:47] targets or people who had no idea they where even being watched.
- [04:51] Although he was half a world away from combat, he ultimately suffered the psychological trauma
- [04:56] felt by many on the ground soldiers. He was diagnosed with PTSD. Brandon suffers no fears
- [05:01] for his own safety, but still experiences the same intrusive memories, nightmares, depression,
- [05:07] anxiety, and substance abuse of many emotionally traumatized combat soldiers. So do a lot of
- [05:12] other drone operators.
- [05:13] But why do some victims or trauma suffer from PTSD while others seem able to move on?
- [05:18] Well, its psychology so the risk factors are complicated. Some findings suggest that there
- [05:23] may be genetic predispositions making some people more vulnerable than others. We also
- [05:27] know that context and environment matter, for instance, someone who has experienced
- [05:31] childhood abuse might feel on the one hand more ready to deal with difficult and traumatic
- [05:35] experiences. But on the other hand they might be more likely to default to the suppression
- [05:39] and avoidance in which PTSD suffers frequently engage, which as we've discussed in previous
- [05:44] episodes often makes psychiatric symptoms worsen over time.
- [05:47] As far as whats going on in the brain, PTSD shares some similarities with anxiety disorders.
- [05:52] For example the brains limbic system may flood the body with waves of stress hormones like
- [05:57] cortisol every time images of the traumatic event bubble up uninvited into consciousness.
- [06:01] And we've already talked a lot about how the amygdala and hippocampus are involved in those
- [06:05] classic fight or flight reactions, which when prolonged can be really rough on the body.
- [06:10] In fact, neuroimaging suggests that trauma -- or the chemical processes set into motion
- [06:15] by trauma -- might actually damage and shrink the hippocampus. Since this region is also
- [06:19] associated with how we consolidate memories, this might explain how memories associated
- [06:24] with trauma could fail to be filed away as long-term memories and instead remain vivid
- [06:29] and fresh through flashbacks and nightmares.
- [06:31] If there's any silver lining to all of this, it's that some people may actually experience
- [06:35] positive change after a trauma. Treatment and social support help some suffers achieve
- [06:40] post-traumatic growth, positive psychological changes resulting from the struggle with challenging
- [06:45] circumstances and life crises.
- [06:47] That's in part what Tolkien did. Though he suffered great trauma and loss on the battlefield,
- [06:52] he was eventually able to use those experiences to drive those powerful, allegorical stories. Stories
- [06:59] that helped not just himself, but many readers of all ages around the world.
- [07:03] It seems that while whatever doesn't kill you might not necessarily make you stronger,
- [07:08] sometimes it really does.
- [07:09] But suffering can feed on itself. Many victims of trauma try to cope through whats colloquially
- [07:14] called self-medicating and some can end up with substance abuse or dependence issues.
- [07:19] Psychologists define addiction or dependence as compulsive, excessive, and difficult-to-control
- [07:24] substance use, or other, initially pleasurable behavior that beings to interfere with ordinary
- [07:29] life, work, health, or relationships.
- [07:31] This could mean over-consuming drugs or alcohol, or compulsively gambling, eating, shopping,
- [07:36] exercising, or having sex. People with addictions may not even realize that they have lost control
- [07:41] of their behavior for some time.
- [07:42] Addiction can refer to a physical dependence, a physiological need for a drug, that reveals
- [07:47] itself through terrible withdrawal symptoms if the use stops or reduces. Or psychological
- [07:52] dependence, the need to use that drug, or complete that activity in order to relieve
- [07:56] negative emotions.
- [07:58] People with addiction can sometimes be stigmatized as pleasure-bound hedonists who have no self-control,
- [08:02] but people often compulsively use substances or do things in reaction to stress and other
- [08:07] psychological problems. For various reasons they have been prevented from coping in other
- [08:12] ways or maybe they just never learned how.
- [08:14] So in this way addiction itself is often secondary to the more complicated matter of how a person
- [08:19] deals with stress and difficult emotions, or what kinds of stressful situations they've survived.
- [08:25] Few will dispute that much of what makes addiction possible is chemistry, but people are different
- [08:30] -- from their life experiences to their biological sensitivities. So people respond in different
- [08:35] way to different drugs and behaviors. Many people can drink casually or gamble once in
- [08:39] a while without losing control. Others simply can't.
- [08:43] People in recovery from addiction may also have different needs. Some will need to be
- [08:46] completely sober and never again touch that drug or do that thing. While others may in
- [08:51] time be able to regain enough control to use again in moderation.
- [08:55] Likewise, some folks can kick the habit on their own while others do better with or need
- [08:59] support from professionals or support groups.
- [09:02] Researchers and groups like Alcoholics Anonymous debate whether addiction is a mental illness
- [09:06] -- like a "software problem" related to thoughts, and behaviors, and feelings -- or a physical disease
- [09:11] -- a "hard wire problem" related to biology and genetics -- or both, and even whether
- [09:15] addiction and dependence are the same thing.
- [09:17] Either way it can be hard to recover from an addiction if you don't get the underlying
- [09:21] problem treated. But some people believe that you can't treat the underlying problem without
- [09:26] first getting the addiction out of the way.
- [09:28] While this controversy too continues, many are moving toward a model of treating both
- [09:33] at at the same time. The so-called Dual Diagnosis Model of treatment.
- [09:37] Addiction that's rooted in deeper psychological issues -- especially in emotional trauma like
- [09:41] PTSD -- often require some version of dual treatment to untangle both issues.
- [09:45] The good news is while PTSD and substance dependence may be distressing and complex,
- [09:50] people can begin to heal given the chance and the resources.
- [09:54] We're amazingly resilient creatures. When nurtured with the proper support and practice, we can overcome a lot.
- [09:59] Today we talked about the causes and symptoms of PTSD and how trauma can affect the brain.
- [10:04] We also looked at addiction, physical and psychological dependence, the relationship
- [10:09] between trauma and addiction, and why they can require dual treatment, and we touched on
- [10:14] post-traumatic growth with the wisdom of Frodo Baggins.

### Transcript (reading)

It's perhaps the most stigmatized and misunderstood psychological disorder of them all, even among psychologists. Maybe because it's pretty rare, affecting about 1% of the population, schizophrenia causes more anxiety in the media, in the public, and even in doctors' offices than any other mental illness. As a result, its sufferers have often been shunned, abused, or locked up. And among the many fallacies that surround the disorder is simply what it means. The word "schizophrenia" literally means "split mind" but contrary to popular belief, the condition has nothing to do with a split in personality or multiple personalities. The term refers instead to what's sometimes called a "split from reality." Multiple Personality

Disorder, now known as Dissociative Identity Disorder, is a totally different type of condition, a kind of dissociative disorder. And these too, are shrouded in misconceptions, partly because they were the subject of, probably, the greatest psychological hoax of all time. While many of us can relate on some level to the emotional swings, nervousness, and compulsions that come with mood and anxiety disorders, it can be a lot harder for those without direct experience to relate to the symptoms of schizophrenia and dissociation. Unfortunately we tend to fear and avoid what we don't understand in each other, whether it's a friend of family member or just some stranger on the bus. But thankfully part of the psychologist's job is to demystify the things that can happen in our heads, and as is

often the case, understanding may be the key to compassion. Schizophrenia is a chronic condition that usually surfaces for men in their early to mid-20s, and for women in their late 20s. For some the disorder comes on gradually, but for others it could arise more suddenly, perhaps triggered by stress or trauma, although no event can actually cause the disorder. Once thought of as a single discrete condition, schizophrenia is now included in the DSM-5 as a point on a spectrum of disorders that vary in how they're expressed and how long they last, but they share similar symptoms. Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders are currently thought of as characterized by disorganized thinking; emotions and behaviors that are often incongruent with their situations; and

disturbed perceptions, including delusions and hallucinations. They all involve a kind of loss of contact with reality on some level. The resulting behaviors and mental states associated with this break from reality are generally called "psychotic symptoms" and they usually impair the ability to function. When someone's experiencing psychotic symptoms, their thinking and speech can become disorganized, rambling and fragmented. This tendency to pick up one train of thought and suddenly switch to another and then another can make communication painfully difficult. People exhibiting these symptoms can also suffer a breakdown in selective attention, losing the ability to focus on one thing while filtering others out.

In extreme cases, speech may become so fragmented it becomes little more than a string of meaningless words, a condition given a name that sounds like its own kind of non sequitur, "word salad." Classic schizophrenia is also often marked by delusions or false beliefs not based in reality. These delusions can be rooted in ideas of grandeur like "I'm the queen of England!" or "I won an Olympic gold medal for the luge!" Or they can become narratives of persecution and paranoia, believing your thoughts and actions are being controlled by an outside force or that you're being spied on or followed or that you're on the verge of a major catastrophe. And there are some complicated variations on these delusions, like feeling that you've

died or don't exist anymore or that someone is madly in love with you or that you're infested with parasites. Delusions of one kind of another strike as many as four out of five people with schizophrenia. While some delusions can seem fairly logical, they can also be severe and bizarre and frightening. Unfortunately maybe the most memorable examples of people suffering from severe delusions come from serial killers and yeah, while Son of Sam did claim that he was taking orders from his neighbor's dog, that kind of stuff is in the tiny, tiny, tiny minority. Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys and Syd Barrett of Pink Floyd both suffered psychotic symptoms. And then of course there's John Nash, the Nobel Prize winning American mathematician and subject of the movie "A Beautiful Mind."

Through proper treatment, some people with schizophrenia have not only learned to live with their illness but also made fantastic creative contributions to the world. Maybe people with schizophrenia also suffer from perceptual disturbances, or sensory experiences that come without any apparent sensory stimulation, like hallucinations. This is when a person sees or hears something that isn't there, often lacking the ability to understand what is real and what isn't. Auditory hallucinations, or hearing voices, are the most common form, and these voices are often abusive. It's as if you're inner monologue, that conversation that you have with yourself or the random things that float through your head, were somehow coming from

outside of you. It's as if you couldn't sort out whether the voices in your mind were internal and self-generated, or external and other-generated. To me, it sounds terrifying. Other common symptoms include disorganized, abnormal, or incongruent behavior and emotions. This could mean laughing when recalling a loved one's death or crying while others are laughing. Acting like a goofy child one minute, then becoming unpredictably angry or agitated the next. Movements may become inappropriate and compulsive, like continually rocking back and forth or remaining motionless for hours. Broadly, most psychotic symptoms fall into three general categories traditionally used by psychologists: positive, negative, and disorganized symptoms.

Positive symptoms are not what they sound like. They're the type that add something to the experience of the patient. Like, for example, hallucinations or inappropriate laughter or tears or delusional thoughts. Negative symptoms refer to those that subtract from normal behavior, like a reduced ability to function, neglect of personal hygiene, lack of emotion, toneless voice, expressionless face, or withdrawal from family and friends. Finally, disorganized symptoms are those jumbles of thought or speech that could include word salad and other problems with attention and organization. Symptoms like these are useful in diagnosing a disorder on the schizophrenia spectrum, but there's a physiological component too. Like many of the disorders we've talked about,

schizophrenia has been associated with a number of brain abnormalities. Post mortem research on schizophrenia patients has found that many have extra receptors for dopamine, a neurotransmitter involved in emotion regulation and the brain's pleasure and reward centers. Some researchers think that overly responsive dopamine systems might magnify brain activity in some way, perhaps creating hallucinations and other so-called positive symptoms as the brain loses its capacity to tell the difference between internal and external stimuli. For this reason, dopamine blocking drugs are often used as anti-psychotic medications in treatment. Modern neuroimaging studies also show that some people with schizophrenia have abnormal brain activity in several different parts of the brain.

One study noted that when patients were hallucinating, for example, there was unusually high activity in the thalamus, which is involved in filtering incoming sensory signals. Another study noted that patients with paranoid symptoms showed over-activity in the fear processing amygdala. So, schizophrenia seems to involve not just problems with one part of the brain, but abnormalities in several areas and their interconnections. But what might be causing these abnormalities? Earlier I mentioned how a stressful event might trigger psychotic symptoms for the first time, even though it can't actually create the disorder. Psychologists call this the "diathesis-stress model." This way of thinking involves a combination of biological and genetic vulnerabilities

-- diathesis -- and environmental stressors -- stress -- that both contribute to the onset of schizophrenia. This model helps explain why some people with genetic vulnerability might not always develop schizophrenia and why the rates of schizophrenia tend to be higher with some degree of poverty or socioeconomic stress. And it seems too that there is some kind of genetic predisposition for the disorder. The one-in-a-hundred odds of developing schizophrenia jumped to nearly one in ten if you have a parent or sibling with the disorder, with about 50/50 odds if that sibling is an identical twin, even if those twins were raised apart. One recent landmark seven year study looked at genetic samples across 35 countries, examining

more than 35,000 people with schizophrenia, and another 110,000 without the disorder. The study identified more than 100 genes that may increase the risk of schizophrenia. As expected, some of these genes involve dopamine regulation, but others are related to immune system functioning. Researchers continue to tease out what is exactly going on here, but many are hopeful that these new findings will lead to better treatment. Clearly, schizophrenia is a challenging disorder to live with and one that's hard for outsiders to understand, but maybe even more rare and more elusive are the dissociative disorders. These are disorders of consciousness, called dissociative because they're marked by an interruption in conscious awareness. Patients can become separated from the thoughts or

feelings that they used to have, which can result in a sudden loss of memory or even change in identity. Now, we might all experience minor dissociation at times, like maybe the sense that you're watching yourself from above, as in a movie, or like you're driving home and get so zoned out that suddenly you find yourself in front of Taco Bell thinking, like, "How did I get here?" Those things would generally fall into the normal range of dissociation, but most of us don't develop different personalities. Dissociative disorders come in several different forms, but the most infamous of the bunch is probably Dissociative Identity Disorder. This has long been known as Multiple Personality Disorder and, yes, it is a thing. It's a rare and flashy disorder in which a person exhibits

two or more distinct and alternating identities and the best known case was that of Shirley Mason, whose story was famously rendered in the 1973 best seller "Sybil" and later in a popular mini-series. The book was marketed as the true story of a woman who suffered great childhood trauma and ended up with 16 different personalities, ranging from Vicky, a selfish French Woman, to handyman Syd, to the religious and critical Clara. The book became a craze and within a few years reported cases of multiple personality skyrocketed from scarcely 100 to nearly 40,000. Many believe the book was essentially responsible for creating a new psychiatric diagnosis. It turns out though, Sybil's story was a big fat lie.

Yes, Shirley Mason was a real person and one with a troubled, traumatic past and a number of psychological issues. As a student in New York in the 1950s she started seeing a therapist named Connie Wilbur and taking some heavy medications. And somewhere in there, maybe because she was coaxed, or maybe because she wanted more attention, Shirley started expressing different personalities. Dr. Wilbur built a career and a book deal out of her star patient, even after Shirley confessed that her split personality was a ruse. The Sybil case is a powerful reminder that we really don't understand dissociative disorders very well or even know if they're always real. Indeed, some people question if Dissociative Identity Disorder is an actual disorder at all.

But some studies have shown distinct body and brain states that seem to appear in different identities, things like one personality being right handed while the other is left handed, or different personalities having variations in their eye sight that ophthalmologists could actually detect. In these cases, dissociations of identity may be in response to stress or anxiety, a sort of extreme coping mechanism. Either way, the debate and the research continue. Today we talked about the major symptoms associated with the schizophrenia spectrum disorders, including disorganized thinking, inappropriate emotions and behaviors, and disturbed perceptions. We also discussed brain activity associated with these disorders and talked about their possible origins including the diathesis stress model.

You also learned about dissociative disorders, and Dissociative Identity Disorder in particular, and the scandal that was the Sybil case.

- [08:02] many are hopeful that these new findings will lead to better treatment.
- [08:05] Clearly, schizophrenia is a challenging disorder to live with and one that's hard for outsiders
- [08:10] to understand, but maybe even more rare and more elusive are the dissociative disorders.
- [08:15] These are disorders of consciousness, called dissociative because they're marked by an
- [08:19] interruption in conscious awareness. Patients can become separated from the thoughts or
- [08:24] feelings that they used to have, which can result in a sudden loss of memory or even
- [08:28] change in identity.
- [08:29] Now, we might all experience minor dissociation at times, like maybe the sense that you're
- [08:34] watching yourself from above, as in a movie, or like you're driving home and get so zoned
- [08:38] out that suddenly you find yourself in front of Taco Bell thinking, like, "How did I get here?"
- [08:42] Those things would generally fall into the normal range of dissociation, but most of
- [08:46] us don't develop different personalities.
- [08:49] Dissociative disorders come in several different forms, but the most infamous of the bunch
- [08:52] is probably Dissociative Identity Disorder. This has long been known as Multiple Personality
- [08:57] Disorder and, yes, it is a thing. It's a rare and flashy disorder in which a person exhibits
- [09:02] two or more distinct and alternating identities and the best known case was that of Shirley
- [09:07] Mason, whose story was famously rendered in the 1973 best seller "Sybil" and later in
- [09:12] a popular mini-series.
- [09:13] The book was marketed as the true story of a woman who suffered great childhood trauma
- [09:17] and ended up with 16 different personalities, ranging from Vicky, a selfish French Woman,
- [09:23] to handyman Syd, to the religious and critical Clara.
- [09:26] The book became a craze and within a few years reported cases of multiple personality skyrocketed
- [09:32] from scarcely 100 to nearly 40,000.
- [09:35] Many believe the book was essentially responsible for creating a new psychiatric
- [09:39] diagnosis. It turns out though, Sybil's story was a big fat lie.
- [09:43] Yes, Shirley Mason was a real person and one with a troubled, traumatic past and a number
- [09:48] of psychological issues. As a student in New York in the 1950s she started seeing a therapist
- [09:53] named Connie Wilbur and taking some heavy medications. And somewhere in there, maybe
- [09:57] because she was coaxed, or maybe because she wanted more attention, Shirley started expressing
- [10:02] different personalities.
- [10:03] Dr. Wilbur built a career and a book deal out of her star patient, even after Shirley
- [10:08] confessed that her split personality was a ruse.
- [10:11] The Sybil case is a powerful reminder that we really don't understand dissociative disorders
- [10:15] very well or even know if they're always real. Indeed, some people question if Dissociative
- [10:20] Identity Disorder is an actual disorder at all.
- [10:23] But some studies have shown distinct body and brain states that seem to appear in different
- [10:28] identities, things like one personality being right handed while the other is left handed,
- [10:33] or different personalities having variations in their eye sight that ophthalmologists could actually detect.
- [10:38] In these cases, dissociations of identity may be in response to stress or anxiety, a
- [10:43] sort of extreme coping mechanism.
- [10:44] Either way, the debate and the research continue.
- [10:48] Today we talked about the major symptoms associated with the schizophrenia spectrum disorders, including
- [10:52] disorganized thinking, inappropriate emotions and behaviors, and disturbed perceptions.
- [10:57] We also discussed brain activity associated with these disorders and talked about their
- [11:01] possible origins including the diathesis stress model.

### Transcript (reading)

When Lauren was fifteen years old, her family moved across the country and she started going to a new school. Already shy, Lauren suffered from low self-confidence and had a hard time transitioning; nothing felt right and soon her changing body became a source of insecurity. Eventually, she began thinking that maybe if she lost weight and focused on fitness, she'd make more friends and feel better about herself and life would get better. Soon she became obsessed with dieting and it quickly spiraled into her subsisting only on rice cakes and apples and candy corn and celery. She like this new feeling of control every time she stood on the scale and saw a lower number. She was achieving something, and that made her feel good. Soon, she thought of nothing else.

But what Lauren couldn't see was that she was no longer healthy. Even when her hair started falling out and her skin grew dry and cracked, and when she could never get warm. When she looked in the mirror, she still saw a chubby girl. Her family, though, did notice, and yet, at a visit to the doctor, she was just told to eat more. She didn't. One day while jogging, she had a heart attack and collapsed. As a teenager, she was 5'7" and weighed eighty-two pounds. Lauren was finally admitted to a psychiatric hospital where she was treated for anorexia nervosa. She was put on bed rest, saw a therapist twice a week, joined a support group and slowly began eating small amounts of food again. Her recovery was slow but, with the support of her family and doctors, she was released eight months later. Though Lauren suffered a few relapses over the years, she is now healthy.

Ultimately, she was lucky. Anorexia, bulimia, and other eating and body dysmorphic disorders can kill. Eating disorders are among the deadliest psychological disorders, with some of the highest rates of death directly attributable to the illness. They slowly ruin the body, but, in order for these conditions to be recognized and treated successfully, they have to be understood as disorders of the mind. Eating Disorder Statistics Here's some scary figures: According to the National Eating Disorder Association, forty-two percent of first to third grade girls want to be thinner; eighty-one percent of ten year olds are afraid of being fat; over half of teenage girls and nearly a third of teenage boys have used troubling weight control methods like fasting, skipping meals, smoking, vomiting, or taking laxatives.

The rate of new cases of eating disorders in Western culture has been increasing since the 1950's, and today in the US, an estimated twenty million women and ten million men have suffered from a clinically significant eating disorder at some point in their lives. But get this straight: we're not talking about fad diets or lifestyle choices spurred by vanity. Eating disorders are psychological illnesses that often come with serious consequences. These disorders tend to fall into three main categories: anorexia, bulimia, and binge eating disorders. Anorexia Nervosa Those suffering from anorexia nervosa, most often adolescent females, essentially maintain a starving diet and, eventually, and abnormally low body weight. As in Lauren's case, anorexia can begin as a diet that quickly spirals out of control as a person becomes obsessed with

continued weight loss, all while still feeling overweight. Our old friend, the DSM V, actually delineates two sub types of the disorder. The first involves restriction, which usually consists of an extremely low-calorie diet, excessive exercise, or purging, like vomiting or the use of laxatives. The second type is the binge/purge sub type, which involves episodes of binge eating combined with the restriction behavior. As you can easily imagine, the physiological effects of this psychological condition can be devastating. As the body is denied crucial nutrients, it slows down to conserve what little energy it has, often resulting in abnormally slow heart rate, loss of bone density, fatigue, muscle weakness, hair loss, severe dehydration, and an extremely low body mass index.

And it's that low body mass that's the defining characteristic of anorexia nervosa - a refusal to maintain a weight at or above what would normally be considered minimally healthy. If this condition persists, of course, it can be deadly, which is why anorexia has what's often estimated to be the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder. That might surprise you, given the host of troubling disorders we've already covered here on Crash Course Psychology, but mortality rates associated with, say, major depression or PTSD or schizophrenia tend to be the result of secondary behavior, like suicide. But with anorexia, the mortality rate is especially high because people can die as a direct result of extreme weight loss and physiological damage. Bulimia Nervosa Another common eating disorder is bulimia nervosa.

While anorexia is characterized primarily by the refusal to maintain a minimal body weight, bulimia is not. People with bulimia tend to maintain an apparently normal, or at least minimally healthy, body weight, but alternate between binge eating, followed by fasting or purging, often by vomiting or using laxatives. A bulimic body may not be as obviously underweight as an anorexic one, but that addictive cycle of binging and purging can seriously damage the whole digestive system, leading to irregular heartbeat, inflammation of the esophagus and mouth, tooth decay and staining, irregular bowel movements, peptic ulcers, pancreatitis, and other organ damage. Sometimes the two diagnoses can be difficult to discern, especially because someone may shift back and forth between anorexic diagnostic features and bulimic diagnostic features.

The DSM V recently added a third category called binge-eating disorder, which is marked Binge-Eating Disorder by significant binge-eating, followed by emotional distress, feelings of lack of control, disgust, or guilt, but without purging or fasting. Causes of Eating Disorders Although sometimes triggered by stress or a need for, or lack of, control, the presence of an eating disorder is not a tell-tale sign of childhood sexual abuse, as was once commonly thought. Instead, these disorders are often predictive indicators of a person's feelings of low self-worth, need to be perfect, falling short of expectations, and concern with others perceptions. Although the prevalence of bulimia and binge-eating is similar among ethnic groups in the United Social & Cultural Components of Eating Disorders States, anorexia is is much more common among white women, often of higher socioeconomic status.

But the prevalence of these disorders is rising in males, too. Today, between ten and twenty percent of people diagnosed with eating disorders are men who feel the same pressure to attain what they imagine is physical perfection, and that's worth noting. These disorders have strong cultural and gender components; the so-called "ideal standard of beauty" varies wildly across cultures and time, and thinness is far from a universal desire, especially in countries where malnutrition and starvation are problems. But in the Western world, and increasingly in other countries, thinness is a common pursuit. And being bombarded with images of unrealistically slender models and jacked celebrities has increased many people's dissatisfaction, or even shame and disgust, with their own bodies.

These are all attitudes that can contribute to eating disorders. Some people have even had plastic surgery to look more like Beyonce, or J-Lo, or...Barbie. Body Dysmorphic Disorders When taken to extremes, this kind of behavior starts inching into the realm of body dysmorphic disorder. Body dysmorphic disorder is another psychological illness, one that centers on a person's obsession with physical flaws - either minor or just imagined. Those suffering from this disorder often obsess over their appearance, often staring into mirrors for hours, and feel distressed or ashamed by what they see. Although it's often lumped in with the eating disorders, our growing understanding of body dysmorphia suggests that it actually shares some traits with obsessive-compulsive disorder, particularly the obsession with some imagined bodily perfection and the compulsion to check

oneself over and over to discern perceived flaws. Not surprisingly, BDD and OCD may share some similar neurophysiological features, although that's still being researched. People suffering from BDD may exercise excessively, groom themselves excessively, or seek out extreme cosmetic procedures, but, unless treated, they usually remain critical and unsatisfied with their looks, to the point of fearing that they have a deformity. People with BDD may suffer from anxiety and depression, start avoiding social situations, and stay home for fear that others will notice and judge their appearance negatively. Obviously, this causes a lot of emotional distress and dysfunction. Some bodybuilders suffer from a particular type of BDD called muscle dysmorphia, sort of the opposite of anorexia, where they become obsessed with the notion that they aren't muscular enough,

even if they're ripping shirts like the Hulk. And again, this isn't mere vanity; people suffering from body dysmorphia disorder look in the mirror and often see a distorted, even grotesque, image in their reflection. Eating Disorders & the Brain So, how do these disorders come about? Well, to be honest, we still have a lot of dots to connect. Neurologically, there are a few compelling clues. In the case of eating disorders, for example, research has long suggested that neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine may play a role. Dopamine is involved in regions of the brain connected to hunger and eating, like the hypothalamus and nucleus accumbens, and some research has found that binge eating appears to alter the regulation of dopamine production in a way that can reinforce further binging.

The result is a neurological pattern that can resemble drug addiction, although the addiction comparison is still pretty controversial. Genetic, Familial, & Environmental Factors Genetics appear to play a role, too, as there seems to be increased risk among genetic relatives with eating disorders as compared to controls. But a lot of attention is also being paid to environmental and familial factors, particularly the behavioral modeling and learning processes that shape how we think about ourselves and our bodies. Specifically, children who grow up observing problematic or unhealthy eating behavior in parents may be at higher risk for developing an eating disorder. And explicitly learning unreasonable or unhealthy values about your weight or your shape from your family, and definitely from your peers, can have a powerful effect.

Eating and body dysmorphic disorders are serious business, but they are treatable -- and perhaps even preventable. If cultural learning contributes to how we eat and how we want to look, then maybe education can help increase our acceptance of our own appearance, and be more accepting of others. Today, you learned about the symptoms and sub types of anorexia, bulimia, and binge-eating Review & Credits disorder, as well as various types of body dysmorphic disorder, and some of the physiological and environmental roots of these conditions.

### Transcript (reading)

I can be smooth and charming and slick. I can make a very confident impression and it's hard to leave me at a loss for words. Sometimes I find myself fantasizing about unlimited success and power, and beauty. I have repeatedly used deceit to cheat, con, or defraud others for my personal gain. To be honest, I don't have much concern for the feelings of other people, or their suffering. Doesn't sound like the Hank you know, does it? These are all statements from the Self-Assessment measure for Personality Disorders, that lets patients describe themselves, ranking each statement in terms of how accurate they think it is. To be honest, you can't rely too much on this kind of self-reporting to assess what we are

talking about today because while some people who are over-confident or obsessed with power or downright deceitful might tell you that they are, there is a certain subset that won't. Many of the disorders that we have talked about so far are considered, "ego-dystonic" meaning that people who have them are aware that they have a problem and tend to be distressed by their symptoms. Like a person with Bipolar Disorder or OCD generally knows that they have a psychological condition and they don't like what it does to them. But some disorders are trickier then that. They are "ego-syntonic," the person experiencing them doesn't necessarily think that they have a problem and sometimes, they think the problem is with everyone else.

Personality disorders fall into this category. These are psychological disorders marked by inflexible, disruptive, and enduring behavior patterns that impair social and other functioning -- whether the sufferer recognizes that or not. Unlike many other conditions that we've talked about, personality disorders are often considered to be chronic and enduring syndromes that create noticeable problems in life. And as you can tell from these self assessment statements, they can range from relatively harmless displays of narcissism, to a true and troubling lack of empathy for other people. Not only can personality disorders be difficult to diagnose and understand, they can also be downright scary. Most of the extreme and severe disorders go by names that you probably

recognize: psychopathy and sociopathy. I'm talking, like, serial killers here, mob bosses, Vlad the Impaler. Cultures have been studying human personality characteristics for thousands of years, but the concept of personality disorders is a much newer idea. Much of our modern classifications of these disorders are based on the work of German psychiatrist, Kurt Schneider, who was one of the earliest researchers into what was then known as psychopathy and published a treatise on the study in 1923. Today, the DSM 5 contains ten distinct personality disorder diagnoses, grouped into three clusters. The first cluster, cluster A, includes what are often labeled simply as "odd" or "eccentric" personality characteristics. For example, someone with paranoid personality disorder

may feel a pervasive distrust of others and be constantly guarded and suspicious while a person with a schizoid personality disorder would seem overly aloof and indifferent, showing no interest in relationships and few emotional responses. Cluster B encompasses dramatic emotional or impulsive personality characteristics. For example, a narcissistic personality can display a selfish grandiose sense of self-importance and entitlement. Meanwhile, a histrionic personality might seem like they're acting a part to get attention, even putting themselves at risk with dramatic, dangerous, and even suicidal gestures. The behavior of Cluster B can be truly self-destructive and frightening, and these disorders are often associated with frequent hospitalization.

Finally, Cluster C encompasses anxious, fearful, or avoidant personality traits. For example, those with avoidant and dependent personality disorders often avoid meeting new people or taking risks and show a lack of confidence, an excessive need to be taken care of, and a tremendous fear of being abandoned. Now, in the past, and, to a great extent, today, some of these categories have been controversial. Many researchers argue that some of these conditions overlap with each other so much that it can be impossible to tease them apart. Narcissistic personality disorder, for example, has many traits that resemble histrionic personality disorder. And because of this gray area, the most commonly diagnosed personality disorder

is actually personality disorder not otherwise specified or PDNOS. The prevalence of this diagnosis suggests that while clinicians can identify a personality disorder in a patient, figuring out the details of the condition can be messy and difficult. One proposed alternative for diagnosing these disorders is the Dimensional Model, which, in essence, gets rid of discrete disorders and replaces them with a range of personality traits or symptoms, rating each person on each dimension. So the Dimensional Model would assess a patient not with the aim of diagnosing one disorder or another, but instead, simply finding out that they rank high on say, narcissism and avoidance. It's a work in progress, so

with another generation, the clinical definition of "personality disorder" may evolve pretty radically. One of the best-studied personality disorders right now is Borderline Personality Disorder, or BPD. Borderline makes it sounds like patients are like, pretty close to being healthy, but not quite, but that is not at all the case. BPD sufferers have often learned to use dysfunctional, unhealthy ways to get their basic psychological needs met, like love and validation, by using things like outbursts of rage, or on the other end of the spectrum, self-injury behaviors like cutting or worse. People with BPD were once commonly maligned by clinicians as 'difficult' or 'attention-seeking', but we now understand BPD as a complicated set of learned behaviors

and emotional responses to traumatic or neglectful environments, particularly in childhood. In a sense, people with this disorder learn that rage or self-harm helped them cope with traumatic situations, but as a result, they also end up using them in non-traumatic situations. Although challenging for patients and clinicians alike, the good news is that some psychotherapies have helped even the most severely suffering, repeatedly hospitalized BPD patients. But probably the most famous well-established, and frankly, troubling personality disorder is Antisocial Personality Disorder. Now, you've heard of this before, but maybe by one of its now somewhat out of vogue synonyms, "psychopathy" or "sociopathy." People with Antisocial Personality

Disorder, usually men, exhibit a lack of conscience for wrongdoing, even towards friends and family members. Their destructive behavior surfaces in childhood or adolescence, beginning with excessive lying, fighting, stealing, violence, or manipulation. As adults, people with this disorder are thought to generally end up in one of two situations: either they are unable to keep a job and engage in violent criminal or similarly dysfunctional behavior; or they become clever, charming con-artists, or ruthless executives who make their way to positions of power. Tony Soprano would have qualified for a diagnosis, even if he wasn't nearly as bad as, say, serial killer Ted Bundy or Vlad the Impaler, the infamous 15th century

Romanian prince who personally watched about 100,000 people get impaled or have the skin of their feet licked off by goats. Yeah. That happened. Despite this classic remorselessness, lack of empathy, and sometimes criminal behavior, criminality is not always a component of antisocial behavior. Certainly many people with criminal records don't fit that psychopathic profile. Most show remorse, love, and concern for friends and family. But still, although anti-social personalities make up just about 1% of the general population, they were estimated in one study to constitute about 16% of the incarcerated population. So, how might someone end up with such a disturbing disorder? Well, as you might expect, the causes

are probably a tangled combination of biological and psychological threads, both genetic and environmental. Although no one has found a single genetic predictor of Antisocial Personality Disorder, twin and adoption studies do show that relatives of those with psychopathic features do have a higher likelihood of engaging in psychopathic behavior themselves. And early signs are sometimes detected as young as age three or four, often as an impairment in fear conditioning, in other words, lower than normal response to things that typically startle or frighten children like loud and unpleasant noises. Most kids only need to get burned by a hot dish once to know to stay away, but kids who end up displaying Antisocial Personalities

as adults don't necessarily connect or care about the learned consequences when they're little. From there, like we've seen in other disorders, genetic and biological influences can intersect with an abusive or neglectful environment to help wire the personality in a peculiar and damaged way. While the vast majority of traumatized people don't grow up to be killers or con-artists, genes do seem to predispose some people to be more sensitive to abuse or trauma. Meanwhile, studies exploring the neural basis of Antisocial Disorder have revealed that when shown evocative photographs, like a child being hit or a woman with a knife at her throat, those with psychopathic personality features showed little change in heart rate and perspiration, as compared to control groups.

And the classic antisocial lack of impulse control and other symptoms have also been linked to deficits in certain brain structures. One study compared PET scans from 41 people convicted of murder to those of non-criminals and found that the convicted killers had greatly reduced activity in the frontal lobe, an area associated with impulse control and keeping aggressive behavior in check. In fact, violent repeat offenders had as much as 11% less frontal lobe tissue than the average brain. Their brains also responded less to facial displays of stress or anguish, something that's also observed in childhood, so it's possible that some antisocial personalities lack empathy because they simply don't or can't register

others' feelings. Research has also suggested an overly reactive dopamine reward system, suggesting that the drive to act on an impulse to gain stimulation or short-term rewards regardless of the consequences may be more intense than the average person's. As we mentioned before, because personality disorders are pretty much egosyntonic by definition, people don't often acknowledge that they have a problem or a need for treatment - and in the case of Antisocial Personality Disorder, even if they did, there aren't many specific treatments available, at least not for adults. But there are some promising interventions for kids and adolescents whose minds and brains are more plastic and adaptable. In this way, the best way to treat Antisocial Personality

Disorder may be in trying to prevent it. According to American psychiatrist Donald W. Black, among others, many kids diagnosed with Conduct Disorder, the diagnostic precursor to Antisocial Disorder, are at high-risk for developing Antisocial Personalities as adults. But by identifying warning signs early on and by working with these kids and families to correct their behavior and remove negative influences, some of that impulse fearlessness could be channeled into healthier directions, like to reward promoting athleticism, or a spirit of adventure. It's important to remember that Antisocial Personality Disorder is only one type of personality disorder. This is a diverse family of psychological conditions determined

by many different factors and we're still in the early stages of diagnosing and understanding the mechanisms behind them. Today, you learned about personality disorders and the difference between ego-dystonic and ego-syntonic disorders. We looked at the three clusters of personality disorder, according to the DSM V, and how personality disorder symptoms often overlap. We also took a look at Borderline and Antisocial Personality Disorders, including their potential bio-psycho-social roots.

- [00:00] I can be smooth and charming and slick. I can make a very confident impression and
- [00:05] it's hard to leave me at a loss for words.
- [00:07] Sometimes I find myself fantasizing about unlimited success and power, and beauty.
- [00:11] I have repeatedly used deceit to cheat, con, or defraud others for my personal gain. To
- [00:16] be honest, I don't have much concern for the feelings of other people, or their suffering.
- [00:20] Doesn't sound like the Hank you know, does it?
- [00:23] These are all statements from the Self-Assessment measure for Personality Disorders, that lets
- [00:26] patients describe themselves, ranking each statement in terms of how accurate they think it is.
- [00:31] To be honest, you can't rely too much on this kind of self-reporting to assess what we are
- [00:35] talking about today because while some people who are over-confident or obsessed with power
- [00:40] or downright deceitful might tell you that they are, there is a certain subset that won't.

### Transcript (reading)

Bernice has issues, and sure we all do, but hers are getting out of hand. At times she goes through bouts of depression that make it hard for her to even get out of bed. Sometimes she suffers from serious anxiety around things like test taking, flying, lots of things. All of which are brutalizing her self-worth and affecting her performance in work and life. She's ready to get professional help and, lucky for Bernice, she has a lot of options. Psychotherapy, perhaps the predominant type of psychological treatment, involves a therapist using a range of techniques to help a patient overcome troubles, gain insight, and achieve personal growth. Now you know by now that there are kinds of perspectives on the human mind and lots of

different philosophies on how to approach it. So it may not come as a surprise that there's also a variety of ways that experts analyze and treat ailments of the mind. They each create their own kind of experience for a person seeking help and to be honest some approaches are better suited for treating certain psychological conditions than others. But with Bernice as our guide we can see how each of these techniques works and maybe in the end we can get her out of bed, feeling more calm and confident, and back in the swing of things. He's back! If we're going to talk about psychotherapy, we've got to start with Freud, right? Psychotherapy, you will recall, is commonly grouped into four major schools or orientations. The psychodynamic,

existential-humanistic, behavioral, and cognitive therapies. Freud's famous lay on the couch and talk psychoanalysis is just one of several related therapies in the psychodynamic family and it was basically the first. In essence, Freud assumed that we didn't really know or at least fully understand ourselves or our motivations. So psychoanalysis served as a kind of historical reconstruction that helped patients access repressed feelings and memories and unconscious thoughts, by using free association and dream analysis with helpful interpretations from the therapist until they gained some self-insight. As you free associate, talk about your past and answer questions, your psychoanalyst picks up on sensitive subjects around which you appear to show resistance. Mental blocks that

keep you from your consciousness because they cause you anxiety. The psychoanalyst notes these resistances and offers interpretations of what might be going on to help promote insight. So if Bernice was visiting a psychoanalyst, talking about her day, the therapist might say "Tell me more about that dream with the birds with the broken wings." Or he might point out resistance, like, "I noticed that when you mentioned your fear of flying, you tend to bring up your childhood, but you never talk about your mother. Why might that be?" The therapist points out what may be unconscious themes to coax them into the light. Maybe Bernice needs to deal with a traumatic childhood memory or the fact that her mom ran away with a pilot or something to understand the roots of her fear.

Today, traditional psychoanalysis is less common. Critics have pointed out that psychoanalytic interpretations aren't easy to prove or disprove, which is a problem when you're trying to take the scientific approach. Plus, psychoanalysis tends to involve many sessions, sometimes 4 or 5 a week over a long period of time, and health insurance just won't cover that anymore. Therapists who have branched off from the psychoanalytic school fall into the psychodynamic family, which includes not just Freudian, theory, but also ideas from Karl Jung, Alfred Adler, Karen Horney, and others. The terms psychoanalytic and psychodynamic are often confused, but you can think of psychoanalysis as Freud's particular baby, while psychodynamic theory is really the family descended from

that baby. Similar to psychoanalysis, psychodynamic therapy focuses on helping people gain insight on the impact of unconscious internal forces, early relationships, and critical childhood experiences. But these therapies don't dwell on the id and the ego and superego or all the sex stuff, at least not like traditional psychoanalysis does. And not all psychologists are interested in rooting through your deep unconscious recesses like it was your underwear drawer. Some therapies focus more on conscious material and believe the present and future are worth more attention than the past. These include the existential-humanistic therapies, championed by Carl Rogers, Viktor Frankl, Fritz Perls, and others, who emphasized

people's inherent capacity for making rational choices, achieving self-acceptance, and attaining their maximum potential. Like the psychodynamic school, existential-humanistic therapy is still insight oriented, but it's much more about promoting growth rather than curing illness. Instead of calling folks patients, humanistic therapies refer to those they help as clients or just, ya know, people. In the mid 1900s, Rogers developed a humanistic technique called client-centered therapy. He encouraged therapists to help their client by providing an empathetic, genuine, and accepting environment and using active listening where the therapist echoes and clarifies what their clients are saying and feeling. Rogers believed these techniques helped to provide a safe,

non-judgmental place where clients could accept themselves, feel valued, and work towards self-actualization. But other therapists in this school brought in more somber topics. Perls, Frankl, and others incorporated the existentialist perspective, understanding anxiety and limits to personal growth is driven by the human impulse to deny the fact that, let's face it, we're all going to die. Sounds a little grim, but much like the existentialist philosophers, these theorists thought to maximize human potential and meaning in life in the face of those existential fears, helping people access their genuine selves. So let's say Bernice sees an existentialist-humanistic therapist and talks about her depression and

how it's keeping her from living a full life. By focusing on the present, this therapist might suggest that Bernice is afraid and avoidant of her true emotions, the bad and scary ones as well as the good ones, which is why she feels emotionally lifeless and drained. So her therapist might say, "Say more about the feelings that you're having right now, in this moment, as you talk about your depression." The therapist would listen without interpreting, at least at first, and help Bernice understand that she was being heard and accepted, which hopefully would give her comfort and strength to begin dealing with the tough emotions that she's been avoiding. Now if Bernice were to make her appointments with a behavior therapist, she'd experience

quite a different session. Behavior therapists argue that simply knowing that you're afraid of flying, for example, won't help you from freaking out at the thought of getting on a plane. Instead these therapists suggest that the problem behavior is the actual issue and the best way to get rid of unwanted automatic behavior is to replace it with more functional behavior through new learning and conditioning. In other words, behavior therapy aims to change behavior in order to change emotions and moods. Behavior therapy is rooted in the experiments of Ivan Pavlov and his classically conditioned dogs that drooled at the sound of a bell and work by E L Thorndike and B F Skinner on operant conditioning or changing behavior by using positive or negative reinforcement.

So say Bernice is seeing a behavior therapist because of an intense fear of flying. We know her fear is keeping her from personal and career goals like going to conferences and vacationing to Baja. But sometimes it even effects her ability to look up at a blue sky or flip through a travel magazine. Her therapist might use counter-conditioning to evoke new responses to the stimuli that trigger this unwanted behavior or she may use other behavior therapy methods like exposure, systematic desensitization, and aversive conditioning to help Bernice modify her reactions and behavior. So she doesn't dwell on having Bernice relive old memories or helping her self-actualize, she just wants to fix the problem behavior.

Aversive conditioning is less common and usually involves pairing an unpleasant stimulus with the targeted behavior. A classic example is giving someone with an alcohol problem a pill that makes them puke when they drink. Far more common and better studied, the exposure therapies treat an anxiety by having a person face their fears by exposing them to real or imagined situations that they typically avoid. Systematic desensitization is a type of exposure therapy that associates a relaxed state of mind with gradually increasing anxiety-inducing stimuli. Taking Bernice from, say, just thinking about flying, to looking at photos of planes in the air to sitting on a grounded plane, to eventually soaring in the skies for reals.

Behavior therapy works pretty well in treating specific fears and problems like phobias and it can also work for people with generalized anxiety disorder or major depression, but it often needs a boost. And we can get that boost from the cognitive therapies, the kind that teach people new, more adaptive ways of thinking. Cognitive therapy focuses more on what people think rather than what they do, assuming that if you can change a self-defeating thought, you can change the related behavior. This is the approach used by founding American cognitive therapist Aaron Beck. He and his colleagues pioneered the Socratic questioning method to help clients reverse destructive and catastrophic beliefs about themselves, the world, or the future at large, such as

everything that could possibly go wrong will go wrong. Say Bernice has a big test coming up, like a really big, all or nothing, end of the year exam. She's freaking out and her anxiety around the test already has her depressed, imagining that she'll fail. If she bombs the test, she fears that her dreams of getting into the graduate programs she wants will be dashed and her life will be over. Classic catastrophic thinking. A cognitive therapist would actively discuss all of this with her, challenging her thinking along the way and, in the end, help Bernice reexamine her assumptions about what's going to happen if she does fail like the world will not end and she will not utterly fail at life. Helping her work toward thinking more positive thoughts about herself and her future.

The cognitive therapist helps patients understand that changing what we say to ourselves is a very effective way to cope with our anxieties and modify our behavior. In other words, it really is the thought that counts. Not surprisingly, the cognitive and behavioral schools have joined forces frequently enough that cognitive-behavior therapies are typically considered a single school, and a lot of therapists use integrative approaches that try to use the best elements of all of these schools of thought. But all of these different psychotherapies don't always mean being alone with your therapist and your thoughts. Most of them can be done in groups, too. Group therapy fosters the therapeutic benefits you get from interacting with other people. Not only does it help with

the social aspects of mental health, but it also may remind clients that they're not alone. In a similar way, family therapy treats a family as a system, and views an individual's problem behaviors as being influenced by, or directed at, other family members. Family therapists work with multiple family members to heal relationships, improve insight and communication, and mobilize communal resources. So, the big question remains. Does psychotherapy work? You're going to have to wait until next time to find out because that is what we will be taking about, along with a look at the biomedical approach to therapy. For now, you've learned about the major types of psychotherapy. These include psychodynamic therapy and Freud's famous psychoanalysis, existential-humanist therapy and Roger's

client-centered focus, and behavior and cognitive therapies. We also took a quick look at group and family therapy.

### Transcript (navigation)

- [00:00] Bernice has issues, and sure we all do, but hers are getting out of hand. At times she
- [00:05] goes through bouts of depression that make it hard for her to even get out of bed. Sometimes
- [00:08] she suffers from serious anxiety around things like test taking, flying, lots of things.
- [00:14] All of which are brutalizing her self-worth and affecting her performance in work and life.
- [00:18] She's ready to get professional help and, lucky for Bernice, she has a lot of options.
- [00:23] Psychotherapy, perhaps the predominant type of psychological treatment, involves a therapist
- [00:27] using a range of techniques to help a patient overcome troubles, gain insight, and achieve personal growth.
- [00:33] Now you know by now that there are kinds of perspectives on the human mind and lots of
- [00:37] different philosophies on how to approach it. So it may not come as a surprise that
- [00:41] there's also a variety of ways that experts analyze and treat ailments of the mind.
- [00:47] They each create their own kind of experience for a person seeking help and to be honest
- [00:50] some approaches are better suited for treating certain psychological conditions than others.
- [00:54] But with Bernice as our guide we can see how each of these techniques works and maybe in
- [00:59] the end we can get her out of bed, feeling more calm and confident, and back in the swing of things.
- [01:14] He's back!
- [01:15] If we're going to talk about psychotherapy, we've got to start with Freud, right? Psychotherapy,
- [01:19] you will recall, is commonly grouped into four major schools or orientations. The psychodynamic,
- [01:26] existential-humanistic, behavioral, and cognitive therapies. Freud's famous lay on the couch
- [01:31] and talk psychoanalysis is just one of several related therapies in the psychodynamic family
- [01:37] and it was basically the first.
- [01:38] In essence, Freud assumed that we didn't really know or at least fully understand ourselves
- [01:43] or our motivations. So psychoanalysis served as a kind of historical reconstruction that
- [01:47] helped patients access repressed feelings and memories and unconscious thoughts, by
- [01:52] using free association and dream analysis with helpful interpretations from the therapist
- [01:57] until they gained some self-insight.
- [01:59] As you free associate, talk about your past and answer questions, your psychoanalyst picks
- [02:04] up on sensitive subjects around which you appear to show resistance. Mental blocks that
- [02:08] keep you from your consciousness because they cause you anxiety. The psychoanalyst notes
- [02:12] these resistances and offers interpretations of what might be going on to help promote insight.
- [02:18] So if Bernice was visiting a psychoanalyst, talking about her day, the therapist might
- [02:22] say "Tell me more about that dream with the birds with the broken wings." Or he might
- [02:26] point out resistance, like, "I noticed that when you mentioned your fear of flying, you
- [02:29] tend to bring up your childhood, but you never talk about your mother. Why might that be?"
- [02:34] The therapist points out what may be unconscious themes to coax them into the light. Maybe
- [02:38] Bernice needs to deal with a traumatic childhood memory or the fact that her mom ran away with
- [02:43] a pilot or something to understand the roots of her fear.
- [02:46] Today, traditional psychoanalysis is less common. Critics have pointed out that psychoanalytic
- [02:50] interpretations aren't easy to prove or disprove, which is a problem when you're trying to take
- [02:55] the scientific approach. Plus, psychoanalysis tends to involve many sessions, sometimes
- [03:01] 4 or 5 a week over a long period of time, and health insurance just won't cover that anymore.
- [03:06] Therapists who have branched off from the psychoanalytic school fall into the psychodynamic
- [03:10] family, which includes not just Freudian, theory, but also ideas from Karl Jung, Alfred
- [03:14] Adler, Karen Horney, and others.
- [03:16] The terms psychoanalytic and psychodynamic are often confused, but you can think of psychoanalysis
- [03:21] as Freud's particular baby, while psychodynamic theory is really the family descended from
- [03:27] that baby. Similar to psychoanalysis, psychodynamic therapy focuses on helping people gain insight
- [03:32] on the impact of unconscious internal forces, early relationships, and critical childhood
- [03:37] experiences. But these therapies don't dwell on the id and the ego and superego or all
- [03:43] the sex stuff, at least not like traditional psychoanalysis does.
- [03:46] And not all psychologists are interested in rooting through your deep unconscious recesses
- [03:51] like it was your underwear drawer. Some therapies focus more on conscious material and believe
- [03:56] the present and future are worth more attention than the past. These include the existential-humanistic
- [04:00] therapies, championed by Carl Rogers, Viktor Frankl, Fritz Perls, and others, who emphasized
- [04:05] people's inherent capacity for making rational choices, achieving self-acceptance, and attaining
- [04:10] their maximum potential.
- [04:12] Like the psychodynamic school, existential-humanistic therapy is still insight oriented, but it's
- [04:18] much more about promoting growth rather than curing illness. Instead of calling folks patients,
- [04:23] humanistic therapies refer to those they help as clients or just, ya know, people.
- [04:28] In the mid 1900s, Rogers developed a humanistic technique called client-centered therapy.
- [04:33] He encouraged therapists to help their client by providing an empathetic, genuine, and accepting
- [04:38] environment and using active listening where the therapist echoes and clarifies what their
- [04:43] clients are saying and feeling. Rogers believed these techniques helped to provide a safe,
- [04:48] non-judgmental place where clients could accept themselves, feel valued, and work towards
- [04:52] self-actualization. But other therapists in this school brought in more somber topics.
- [04:57] Perls, Frankl, and others incorporated the existentialist perspective, understanding
- [05:02] anxiety and limits to personal growth is driven by the human impulse to deny the fact that,
- [05:07] let's face it, we're all going to die. Sounds a little grim, but much like the existentialist
- [05:12] philosophers, these theorists thought to maximize human potential and meaning in life in the
- [05:17] face of those existential fears, helping people access their genuine selves.
- [05:22] So let's say Bernice sees an existentialist-humanistic therapist and talks about her depression and
- [05:28] how it's keeping her from living a full life. By focusing on the present, this therapist
- [05:32] might suggest that Bernice is afraid and avoidant of her true emotions, the bad and scary ones
- [05:37] as well as the good ones, which is why she feels emotionally lifeless and drained. So
- [05:42] her therapist might say, "Say more about the feelings that you're having right now, in this
- [05:46] moment, as you talk about your depression." The therapist would listen without interpreting,
- [05:50] at least at first, and help Bernice understand that she was being heard and accepted, which
- [05:55] hopefully would give her comfort and strength to begin dealing with the tough
- [05:59] emotions that she's been avoiding.
- [06:01] Now if Bernice were to make her appointments with a behavior therapist, she'd experience
- [06:04] quite a different session. Behavior therapists argue that simply knowing that you're afraid
- [06:09] of flying, for example, won't help you from freaking out at the thought of getting on
- [06:13] a plane. Instead these therapists suggest that the problem behavior is the actual issue
- [06:17] and the best way to get rid of unwanted automatic behavior is to replace it with more functional
- [06:22] behavior through new learning and conditioning. In other words, behavior therapy aims to change
- [06:26] behavior in order to change emotions and moods. Behavior therapy is rooted in the experiments
- [06:31] of Ivan Pavlov and his classically conditioned dogs that drooled at the sound of a bell and
- [06:35] work by E L Thorndike and B F Skinner on operant conditioning or changing behavior by using
- [06:42] positive or negative reinforcement.
- [06:43] So say Bernice is seeing a behavior therapist because of an intense fear of flying. We know
- [06:48] her fear is keeping her from personal and career goals like going to conferences and
- [06:53] vacationing to Baja. But sometimes it even effects her ability to look up at a blue sky
- [06:58] or flip through a travel magazine. Her therapist might use counter-conditioning to evoke new
- [07:02] responses to the stimuli that trigger this unwanted behavior or she may use other behavior
- [07:08] therapy methods like exposure, systematic desensitization, and aversive conditioning
- [07:13] to help Bernice modify her reactions and behavior. So she doesn't dwell on having Bernice relive
- [07:18] old memories or helping her self-actualize, she just wants to fix the problem behavior.
- [07:23] Aversive conditioning is less common and usually involves pairing an unpleasant stimulus with
- [07:28] the targeted behavior. A classic example is giving someone with an alcohol problem a pill
- [07:33] that makes them puke when they drink.
- [07:34] Far more common and better studied, the exposure therapies treat an anxiety by having a person
- [07:39] face their fears by exposing them to real or imagined situations that they typically
- [07:45] avoid. Systematic desensitization is a type of exposure therapy that associates a relaxed
- [07:49] state of mind with gradually increasing anxiety-inducing stimuli. Taking Bernice from, say, just thinking
- [07:56] about flying, to looking at photos of planes in the air to sitting on a grounded plane,
- [08:00] to eventually soaring in the skies for reals.
- [08:03] Behavior therapy works pretty well in treating specific fears and problems like phobias and
- [08:07] it can also work for people with generalized anxiety disorder or major depression, but
- [08:12] it often needs a boost. And we can get that boost from the cognitive therapies, the kind
- [08:16] that teach people new, more adaptive ways of thinking. Cognitive therapy focuses more
- [08:21] on what people think rather than what they do, assuming that if you can change a self-defeating
- [08:26] thought, you can change the related behavior.
- [08:28] This is the approach used by founding American cognitive therapist Aaron Beck. He and his
- [08:33] colleagues pioneered the Socratic questioning method to help clients reverse destructive
- [08:38] and catastrophic beliefs about themselves, the world, or the future at large, such as
- [08:43] everything that could possibly go wrong will go wrong.
- [08:46] Say Bernice has a big test coming up, like a really big, all or nothing, end of the year
- [08:50] exam. She's freaking out and her anxiety around the test already has her depressed, imagining
- [08:56] that she'll fail. If she bombs the test, she fears that her dreams of getting into the

### Transcript (reading)

If you saw our last lesson on psychotherapy you might be wondering: What happened to Bernice? Has she found a way to manage her depression? Is she still wracked with anxiety? Well it's really nice of you to ask. And I'll tell her you said, "hi." But for our purposes as students of psychology, the bigger question arising from Bernice's case is "has psychotherapy helped?" and just as important, "how can we tell?" Well believe it or not, one of the main ways experts use is to simply ask the client, and see how they say they're doing. Is Bernice out of bed, and living her life? Did she make it through mid-terms without spiraling into a crisis? And did she take that plane trip to Baja to party with her girls?

As a clinician, that would all be useful to know, right? But the key is that we want to ask these questions in a scientifically rigorous manner, so that we really know a treatment works, rather than just extrapolating from individual cases. And there's also a whole other category of treatment that's pretty different from the talking and listening that goes on in psychotherapy. These are as much medical intervention as they are psychological science; the biomedical treatments. These can be as common-place as medications like Zoloft or Lithium, or a bit more unusual and invasive like magnetic stimulation, neural implants, or even electroshock therapy. And YES, it's still a thing.

Healing a troublesome mind isn't like healing a broken arm. So one of the challenges that psychologists face is simply knowing whether they're doing their job, and doing it well. The methods psychologists use to assess how effective treatments are mostly involve client and clinician perceptions along with outcome research. Client perceptions are just what they sound like, you see a therapist, and someone asks you how you feel after your treatment. It varies by treatment, but client perception tends to be pretty rosy. One study found that 89% of folks said that they were at least "fairly well satisfied" with their treatment. But of course, perceptions are inherently subjective, and some believe that the therapeutic

relationship lends itself to a positive bias in client reviews. Basically, if you're sticking to your treatment, you probably like your therapist. Clinician perspectives can be similarly skewed, not only in terms of a self-serving bias, but also because they may not be around to see a client's future relapses or setbacks in mental health. A patient could see ten therapists over time, feel better at the end of each treatment, but keep struggling over the long term, even though each therapist thought the treatment was a success. So, can we objectively measure how well psychotherapy works? Well, we have treatment outcome research, a way of systematically measuring which therapies work best for which problems.

And the gold standard of treatment outcome research is the randomized clinical trial, or RCT. If you will remember your research methods, you'll know that RCTs generally require randomly selected and assigned participants, a control group, and at least one experimental group that receives the treatment. This design accounts for individual differences between people and other extraneous factors, so that we know that if people in the experimental group get better and people in the control group don't, it was truly the therapeutic intervention that made the difference. And once enough researchers have run their own RCTs, you can gather data via meta analysis, measuring results across multiple trials to see basically whether a treatment works, and

how well it does, across a variety of settings. Two important terms you should know here are effectiveness and efficacy. Effectiveness is whether or not a given therapy works in a "real-world setting," whereas efficacy is whether a therapy works better than some other, comparable intervention, or a control. Both terms matter, and you'll wanna get them straight, if you're tryin' to parse the research literature. Dozens of studies have confirmed that psychotherapy is both effective and efficacious. While controls, usually people who don't get any therapy, often do get better on their own, those in psychotherapy usually improve faster, and with a significantly lower risk of relapse.

However, and try not to look too shocked when I tell you this, there is a lot of argument about which therapies work best. In some cases, like phobias, there are clear winners, behavior therapy for instance. In others, like major depressive disorder, there are cognitive, behavioral and psychodynamic interventions that have all been successful in RCTs. And while a lot of psychologists seem to get a kick out of arguing about which therapies are better than others, there do seem to be some common factors that unite the more effective ones. A big one is simply instilling hope, helping demoralized clients regain hope that things can, and will get better. There is also the value of getting a new perspective, learning

that there is a plausible explanation for your troubles, and finding a new way of looking at yourself, the world around you, and what your future might look like. And across the board, any good therapist provides genuine empathy within a trusting, caring relationship. They seek to listen, and understand and not judge, and offer clear and positive communication. But psychotherapy, or talking it out, is just one way to treat psychological disorders. Quite often, biomedical therapies are an option, sometimes for the more severe disorders, but in many cases, in combination with psychotherapy. Biomedical therapies aim to physiologically change the brain's electrochemical state with psychotropic drugs, magnetic impulses, or

even electrical currents and surgery. As you might expect, pharmacotherapy is by far the most widely used, that's the one where you just take drugs. Psychotropic drugs are just any pharmaceutical that affects your mental state, the most commonly used ones fall into four major categories; antipsychotics, anxiolytics, antidepressants, and mood stabilizers, each aimed at a specific family of problems. Antipsychotics are used to treat schizophrenia and other types of severe thought disorders. Most of these medications alter the effects of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain by blocking its receptor sites, and blocking its uptake. This is based on the assumption that an overactive dopamine system contributes to schizophrenia, but, like many psychotropic

drugs, antipsychotics come with nasty side effects. Anxiolytics, or anti-anxiety meds, usually work by depressing activity in the central nervous system, much like a stiff drink might. For this reason, and others, it can be super dangerous to mix certain anxiety meds with booze. Also, letting your nerves mellow out can feel so good that patients may risk becoming addicted to some anxiolytics. Antidepressants are used to treat depression, as you might expect, but also a number of anxiety disorders. Each type is thought to work a bit differently, mainly by altering the availability of various neurotransmitters, like serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain, which in turn appears to help with mood and anxiety problems. Some of the most common

are selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, like Zoloft, Paxil, and Prozac, which partially block the normal re-uptake of serotonin. This makes it more available to the synapses, which, hypothetically at least, allows its mood-enhancing effects to kick in. Current research suggests that the use of antidepressant medication is most effective when combined with psychotherapy, which makes a lot of sense, and the same goes for a number of other psychological disorders. It's worth pointing out here that some meta-analyses suggest that antidepressants aren't any more effective than psychotherapy when symptoms are mild to moderate. One meta analysis that riled people up in recent years even suggested that antidepressants are no better than a

placebo in those cases. So psychotropic drugs can help, but sometimes you also need to start exploring the root causes of your issues and reevaluate how you deal with them, which is what psychotherapy is perfect for. Bernice, for example, probably would have benefited from both talk therapy and a dose of anxiolytic or antidepressant meds. The last big psychotropic drug group is the mood-stabilizers. They can be extremely effective in smoothing out the highs and lows of bipolar disorder. Simple salts of Lithium were the first of these drugs used, and they remain in widespread use today. Dr. Kay Redfield Jamison, who we talked about a few weeks ago has said that Lithium "prevents my disastrous highs, diminishes my depressions, gentles me out, keeps me from ruining my career and

relationships, keeps me out of a hospital, and alive." And while drugs are the most popular biomedical treatment, they aren't the only kind. For one, there's electro-shock therapy. Now, hear me out, this does carry a long history of negative connotations, like of people being strapped down and shocked into mental oblivion, but the technology has made a comeback, and can actually be quite effective in treating severe, treatment-resistant depression. It's properly called electroconvulsive therapy, or ECT, and it involves sending a brief electrical current through the brain of an anesthetized patient. This excites the neurons, causing them to fire rapidly, until the patient goes through a small, controlled seizure that lasts about two minutes. And we're not exactly sure

why this helps to relieve negative symptoms, but there are several theories that are being pursued. One suggests that the resulting seizure beneficially alters neurotransmitter activity in areas of the brain associated with moods and emotions, effectively jumpstarting a severely depressed brain. Another theory suggests that these electrical impulses modify stress hormone activity in the brain, which we know could play a role in sleep, energy, appetite, and mood. ECT may also re-activate previously dormant or suppressed neurons, or possibly stimulate the growth of new ones in key brain regions, helping the brain regain some level of lost functioning. There are a couple of other brain-stimulation treatments, too, that are more gentle. One

is repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, rTMS, which involves the painless application of repeated electromagnetic pulses. Another, deep-brain stimulation, DBS, is more invasive, and calls for surgically implanting a kind of "brain pacemaker" that sends out electrical impulses to specific parts of the brain. Despite all the new research and often positive results around rTMS and DBS, we're still sorting out how these treatments work to heal the brain and mind, but they're hypothesized to jump-start the neural circuitry in a depressed brain, similarly to ECT. So you'll notice that all these options come with certain risks, and really no treatment is entirely risk free, perhaps not even psychotherapy. But we should also note that some of the less

severe manifestations of psychological disorders may be improved with pretty simple lifestyle changes. Thirty to sixty minutes of daily aerobic exercise has been shown to be as effective as antidepressant medications in research on mild depression. Just remember those words; "daily" and "aerobic." Adequate sleep, social interaction, and good nutrition also all play a part in managing moods. In other words, general healthy living helps. There's an Old English proverb that says "different sores have different salves" and the same is true here. What works for one person may not work for another, and sometimes a few different kinds of intervention might be needed all at once.

Today you learned how client and clinician perceptions, outcome research, and meta-analytic reviews work together to determine the efficacy and effectiveness of psychological treatments. You also learned how biomedical therapies work, including the four major families of drug therapies, along with electro-convulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, and deep brain stimulation. And also how lifestyle changes and general healthy living can improve mental health.

- [00:56] treatments. These can be as common-place as medications like Zoloft or Lithium, or a bit
- [01:01] more unusual and invasive like magnetic stimulation, neural implants, or even electroshock therapy.
- [01:07] And YES, it's still a thing.
- [01:19] Healing a troublesome mind isn't like healing a broken arm. So one of the challenges that
- [01:23] psychologists face is simply knowing whether they're doing their job, and doing it well.
- [01:28] The methods psychologists use to assess how effective treatments are mostly involve client
- [01:32] and clinician perceptions along with outcome research. Client perceptions are just what
- [01:37] they sound like, you see a therapist, and someone asks you how you feel after your treatment.
- [01:41] It varies by treatment, but client perception tends to be pretty rosy. One study found that
- [01:45] 89% of folks said that they were at least "fairly well satisfied" with their treatment.
- [01:49] But of course, perceptions are inherently subjective, and some believe that the therapeutic
- [01:53] relationship lends itself to a positive bias in client reviews. Basically, if you're sticking
- [01:58] to your treatment, you probably like your therapist.
- [02:01] Clinician perspectives can be similarly skewed, not only in terms of a self-serving bias,
- [02:05] but also because they may not be around to see a client's future relapses or setbacks
- [02:10] in mental health. A patient could see ten therapists over time, feel better at the end
- [02:13] of each treatment, but keep struggling over the long term, even though each
- [02:17] therapist thought the treatment was a success.
- [02:20] So, can we objectively measure how well psychotherapy works? Well, we have treatment
- [02:24] outcome research, a way of systematically measuring which therapies work best for which problems.
- [02:30] And the gold standard of treatment outcome research is the randomized clinical trial, or RCT.
- [02:35] If you will remember your research methods, you'll know that RCTs generally require randomly
- [02:39] selected and assigned participants, a control group, and at least one experimental group
- [02:44] that receives the treatment. This design accounts for individual differences between people
- [02:48] and other extraneous factors, so that we know that if people in the experimental group get
- [02:52] better and people in the control group don't,
- [02:54] it was truly the therapeutic intervention that made the difference.
- [02:57] And once enough researchers have run their own RCTs, you can gather data via meta analysis,
- [03:02] measuring results across multiple trials to see basically whether a treatment works, and
- [03:07] how well it does, across a variety of settings.
- [03:10] Two important terms you should know here are effectiveness and efficacy. Effectiveness
- [03:15] is whether or not a given therapy works in a "real-world setting," whereas efficacy is
- [03:20] whether a therapy works better than some other, comparable intervention, or a control. Both
- [03:25] terms matter, and you'll wanna get them straight, if you're tryin' to parse the research literature.
- [03:30] Dozens of studies have confirmed that psychotherapy is both effective and efficacious. While controls,
- [03:36] usually people who don't get any therapy, often do get better on their own, those in
- [03:40] psychotherapy usually improve faster, and with a significantly lower risk of relapse.
- [03:45] However, and try not to look too shocked when I tell you this, there is a lot of argument
- [03:50] about which therapies work best.
- [03:51] In some cases, like phobias, there are clear winners, behavior therapy for instance. In
- [03:56] others, like major depressive disorder, there are cognitive, behavioral and psychodynamic
- [04:01] interventions that have all been successful in RCTs. And while a lot of psychologists
- [04:05] seem to get a kick out of arguing about which therapies are better than others, there do
- [04:09] seem to be some common factors that unite the more effective ones.
- [04:13] A big one is simply instilling hope, helping demoralized clients regain hope that things
- [04:19] can, and will get better. There is also the value of getting a new perspective, learning
- [04:23] that there is a plausible explanation for your troubles, and finding a new way of looking
- [04:27] at yourself, the world around you, and what your future might look like. And across the
- [04:31] board, any good therapist provides genuine empathy within a trusting, caring relationship.
- [04:37] They seek to listen, and understand and not judge, and offer clear and positive communication.
- [04:42] But psychotherapy, or talking it out, is just one way to treat psychological disorders.
- [04:47] Quite often, biomedical therapies are an option, sometimes for the more severe disorders, but
- [04:52] in many cases, in combination with psychotherapy. Biomedical therapies aim to physiologically
- [04:57] change the brain's electrochemical state with psychotropic drugs, magnetic impulses, or
- [05:02] even electrical currents and surgery. As you might expect, pharmacotherapy is by far the
- [05:07] most widely used, that's the one where you just take drugs. Psychotropic drugs are just
- [05:10] any pharmaceutical that affects your mental state, the most commonly used ones fall into
- [05:14] four major categories; antipsychotics, anxiolytics, antidepressants, and mood stabilizers,
- [05:19] each aimed at a specific family of problems.
- [05:22] Antipsychotics are used to treat schizophrenia and other types of severe thought disorders.
- [05:26] Most of these medications alter the effects of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain
- [05:30] by blocking its receptor sites, and blocking its uptake. This is based on the assumption
- [05:35] that an overactive dopamine system contributes to schizophrenia, but, like many psychotropic
- [05:39] drugs, antipsychotics come with nasty side effects.
- [05:42] Anxiolytics, or anti-anxiety meds, usually work by depressing activity in the central
- [05:47] nervous system, much like a stiff drink might. For this reason, and others, it can be super
- [05:52] dangerous to mix certain anxiety meds with booze. Also, letting your nerves mellow out
- [05:56] can feel so good that patients may risk becoming addicted to some anxiolytics.
- [06:01] Antidepressants are used to treat depression, as you might expect, but also a number of
- [06:05] anxiety disorders. Each type is thought to work a bit differently, mainly by altering
- [06:09] the availability of various neurotransmitters, like serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain,
- [06:14] which in turn appears to help with mood and anxiety problems. Some of the most common
- [06:17] are selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, like Zoloft, Paxil, and Prozac,
- [06:24] which partially block the normal re-uptake of serotonin. This makes it more available
- [06:28] to the synapses, which, hypothetically at least, allows its mood-enhancing effects to
- [06:33] kick in. Current research suggests that the use of antidepressant medication is most effective
- [06:36] when combined with psychotherapy, which makes a lot of sense, and the same goes for a number
- [06:41] of other psychological disorders.
- [06:43] It's worth pointing out here that some meta-analyses suggest that antidepressants aren't any more
- [06:47] effective than psychotherapy when symptoms are mild to moderate. One meta analysis that
- [06:52] riled people up in recent years even suggested that antidepressants are no better than a
- [06:56] placebo in those cases. So psychotropic drugs can help, but sometimes you also need to start
- [07:01] exploring the root causes of your issues and reevaluate how you deal with them, which is
- [07:06] what psychotherapy is perfect for.
- [07:08] Bernice, for example, probably would have benefited from both talk therapy and a dose
- [07:12] of anxiolytic or antidepressant meds.
- [07:14] The last big psychotropic drug group is the mood-stabilizers. They can be extremely effective
- [07:18] in smoothing out the highs and lows of bipolar disorder. Simple salts of Lithium were the
- [07:22] first of these drugs used, and they remain in widespread use today. Dr. Kay Redfield
- [07:27] Jamison, who we talked about a few weeks ago has said that Lithium "prevents my disastrous
- [07:31] highs, diminishes my depressions, gentles me out, keeps me from ruining my career and
- [07:35] relationships, keeps me out of a hospital, and alive."
- [07:38] And while drugs are the most popular biomedical treatment, they aren't the only kind. For
- [07:43] one, there's electro-shock therapy. Now, hear me out, this does carry a long history of
- [07:48] negative connotations, like of people being strapped down and shocked into mental oblivion,
- [07:52] but the technology has made a comeback, and can actually be quite effective in treating
- [07:57] severe, treatment-resistant depression. It's properly called electroconvulsive therapy,
- [08:01] or ECT, and it involves sending a brief electrical current through the brain of an anesthetized
- [08:06] patient. This excites the neurons, causing them to fire rapidly, until the patient goes
- [08:10] through a small, controlled seizure that lasts about two minutes. And we're not exactly sure
- [08:15] why this helps to relieve negative symptoms, but there are several theories that are being pursued.
- [08:20] One suggests that the resulting seizure beneficially alters neurotransmitter activity in areas
- [08:25] of the brain associated with moods and emotions, effectively jumpstarting a severely depressed
- [08:29] brain. Another theory suggests that these electrical impulses modify stress hormone
- [08:33] activity in the brain, which we know could play a role in sleep, energy, appetite, and
- [08:38] mood. ECT may also re-activate previously dormant or suppressed neurons, or possibly
- [08:43] stimulate the growth of new ones in key brain regions, helping the brain regain some level of lost functioning.
- [08:50] There are a couple of other brain-stimulation treatments, too, that are more gentle. One
- [08:54] is repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, rTMS, which involves the painless application
- [08:59] of repeated electromagnetic pulses. Another, deep-brain stimulation, DBS, is more invasive,
- [09:05] and calls for surgically implanting a kind of "brain pacemaker" that sends out electrical
- [09:10] impulses to specific parts of the brain. Despite all the new research and often positive results
- [09:15] around rTMS and DBS, we're still sorting out how these treatments work to heal the brain
- [09:20] and mind, but they're hypothesized to jump-start the neural circuitry in a depressed brain, similarly to ECT.
- [09:26] So you'll notice that all these options come with certain risks, and really no treatment
- [09:30] is entirely risk free, perhaps not even psychotherapy. But we should also note that some of the less
- [09:36] severe manifestations of psychological disorders may be improved with pretty simple lifestyle
- [09:40] changes. Thirty to sixty minutes of daily aerobic exercise has been shown to be as effective
- [09:45] as antidepressant medications in research on mild depression. Just remember those words;
- [09:49] "daily" and "aerobic." Adequate sleep, social interaction, and good nutrition also all play
- [09:54] a part in managing moods. In other words, general healthy living helps. There's an Old
- [09:59] English proverb that says "different sores have different salves" and the same is true
- [10:03] here. What works for one person may not work for another, and sometimes a few different
- [10:07] kinds of intervention might be needed all at once.
- [10:09] Today you learned how client and clinician perceptions, outcome research, and meta-analytic
- [10:14] reviews work together to determine the efficacy and effectiveness of psychological treatments.
- [10:19] You also learned how biomedical therapies work, including the four major families of
- [10:23] drug therapies, along with electro-convulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic
- [10:27] stimulation, and deep brain stimulation. And also how lifestyle changes and general healthy
- [10:33] living can improve mental health.
