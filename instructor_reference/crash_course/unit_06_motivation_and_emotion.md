### Transcript (reading)

You've probably heard this story. Aron Ralston was out climbing in Utah's Bluejohn Canyon when a giant rock shifted under his feet, and he fell, pinning his right arm to the canyon wall. He was stuck, and worse, he hadn't told anyone where we was going. For the next five days, Ralston tried to move and chip away at the rock. He ate his remaining food, drank the last of his water. Eventually he drank his own urine, and started videotaping his goodbyes. But then something happened. Ralston had a dream. He saw himself as a father, picking up his son, and with that vision, an overpowering will to survive kicked in. He broke his arm bones, sawed through his flesh with a dull pocket knife, and freed himself.

Ralston harnessed some of our most powerful psychological forces -- hunger, thirst, desire to be part of a family, need to return to the human community -- they ignited his tenacity, which allowed him to do an incredible thing. He harnessed the power of motivation. Obviously, in a big, big way. [INTRO] In its most basic sense, motivation is the need or desire to do something. Whether that need is biological, social, or emotional, and whether that something is making dinner, going to college, or cutting off your arm, motivation is what gets you moving. But the big question is, why? Why do we do anything? I mean, why ever bother changing out of my sweatpants? Psychologists often view motivation in one of four ways. On their own, none of these

theories is perfect, but taken together, they help us understand what drives us. Let's start with the first theory: an evolutionary perspective. For a while in the early 20th century, it was popular to think of all behaviors as instincts, or innate drives to act a certain way. But this so-called Instinct Theory was misguided, in part because the presence of a tendency doesn't always mean it's supposed to be there. Like, we can imagine why a bunch of people might start rioting at a heated soccer match, but to say that they're supposed to -- a little short-sighted. Evolution is a far more complex, chaotic, and interesting process than that. Plenty of behaviors could just be accidents of evolution -- late paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould called

these accidents "spandrels," or traits that rather than being "adaptive" just stuck around as byproducts of other processes. Today we define instincts as complex, unlearned behaviors that have a fixed pattern throughout a species. For example, dogs instinctively shake their fur when wet, salmon return to the stream in which they hatched, and human babies know how to suckle just minutes after being born. These are true, genetically-predisposed instincts that do not require learning. But today we understand that while certain tendencies may be genetic, individual experience plays a major role in behavior and motivation, as well. So another theory of motivation suggests that a physiological need, or drive, simply compels

us to reduce that need. This is called the drive-reduction theory. This can be as simple as hearing my stomach growl, and looking for a burrito. My need is food, my drive is hunger, my drive-reduction behavior is burrito. Drive reduction is all about maintaining your body's homeostasis -- the physiological balance of its systems. As much as we're pushed to reduce our drives, we're also pulled along by incentives — the positive or negative stimuli that either entice or repel us. The mouth-watering smell of that burrito pulls me toward it, just as much as my hunger pushes me there. However, we're also clearly more complicated than our homeostatic systems, and drive-reduction theory may over-simplify a lot of our behavior. For example, a person may fast for days, ignoring

their body's hunger to honor some spiritual or political cause; and I know I'm not the only one who sometimes eats when I'm not actually hungry. So a third theory -- the theory of optimal arousal -- attempts to fill in some of those gaps. It suggests rather than just reducing a drive or tension, like hunger, we're motivated to maintain a balance between stimulation and relaxation. Say you're holed up in your house all weekend studying. You're bored and lonely and gettin' weird, so you call up some friends to go mountain biking or to a karaoke bar or whatever you like to do to for stimulation. The idea here is that you want to hit the right level of arousal -- which, take note, psychologists often use in a non-sexual sense -- without getting overstimulated and stressed.

So if you nearly break your face on that bike ride, or if the Journey covers at karaoke start getting too intense, you may need to back off and take a nap. Of course everyone has a different level of optimal arousal, and I'm guessing Aron Ralston's was fairly high. Adrenaline junkies may jump out of planes to hit their ideal level, whereas others might be satiated by an engaging book, or new knitting pattern. No matter which, the optimal arousal theory suggests that we're motivated to avoid both boredom and stress. And obviously not all needs are created equally. If I'm suffocating and can't catch a breath, I'm not going to be thinking about eating that burrito. And if I'm about to be ravaged by lions, I'm not going to worrying about my paycheck.

American psychologist Abraham Maslow illustrated this shuffling of priorities in the mid-1900's with his famous hierarchy of needs. Down at the bottom of the pyramid you'll find our most basic physiological needs for food, water, air, and moderate temperatures. The next rung up speaks to our need for safety, then comes love and belonging, followed by esteem or respect, and finally, once all those needs have been met, we have the relative luxury of being motivated by self-actualization and spiritual growth, and yoga retreats and stuff. Of course there are problems with Maslow's vision. Empirical research hasn't really supported his hierarchy. We tend to skip around on that pyramid all the time, and the importance of

those higher-level needs may vary depending on our culture and finances and personalities. But still, everyone is restricted by the lowest levels of the pyramid. So, regardless of the theories about why we have them, most schools of psychological thought agree that we are driven by at least three big motivators: sex, hunger, and the need to belong. We'll do a whole lesson later about all sorts of sex-related stuff, including how it motivates us. There's a lot there. For now, let's just say that sexual motivation is how we promote the survival of our species through recreation and/or procreation - both of which help human communities bond and expand. Without it, none of us would be here today, thinking about burritos and severed arms and sex and stuff.

Internally, we are biologically driven to knock boots by our sex hormones. We're also motivated by psychological and sociocultural influences - ranging from suggestive external stimuli plastered all over billboards, magazines, and TVs in the form of, you know, scantily-clad bodies sprawled out on beaches to more genteel desires like love, family, or adherence to personal, religious, or cultural values. Sex is a big motivator, but it isn't precisely a need, no matter what anyone has told you. People do not die without it. Hunger, though... After air and water, food is our body's greatest need, and thus obtaining food is one of our greatest motivations. Hunger may seem pretty simple. Eat food, stay alive. But physiologically and psychologically,

there is a lot going on. And like so many things, it starts in the brain. The sensation of hunger usually begins with a drop in your blood-sugar level. Glucose is our body's primary source of energy, and while you might not initially feel it drop, your brain will. Your hypothalamus monitors your blood chemistry, and responds to both high levels of the "hunger hormone" ghrelin, and low levels of glucose by triggering that feeling of hunger reminding you to eat something. I am in fact experiencing it right now! Once you've eaten that burrito, your metabolism takes over, converting that food into energy. But while our physiological need for calories varies depending on our body size and composition, your gender, and your age, our hunger is also shaped by our psychology, culture, and mood.

And these factors don't just rule when we're hungry, they also guide what we're hungry for. Biologically speaking, most humans, and many other animals, have a genetic taste for sweets and fatty foods, because they're typically high in energy. But other taste preferences are conditioned through experience and culture. I may have an aversion to oysters because they once made me sick, and love gingerbread cookies because my grandma used to make them. Although popular in Cambodia, I'm not too keen on eating fried tarantulas, just as lots of folks around the world think that the very idea of peanut butter is gross. Still, the feeling of hunger affects us the same. During World War Two in the US, some conscientious objectors volunteered for medical research

as an alternative way to serve their country. Perhaps the most famous of these studies was physiologist Ancel Keys' Minnesota Hunger Experiment, which measured the effects of semistarvation, by partially starving its volunteers. While ethically dubious, the experiment was geared toward understanding the many small and large effects of hunger, which was plaguing Europe at the time. The study started in 1944, by feeding 36 young, healthy men a normal diet for three months, then halving their caloric intake for six months, then slowly rehabilitating them to normal weight during the last three months. They ate mostly wartime-foods like root vegetables, bread, and pastas, and were required to walk 22 miles, and participate in various work and educational activities, for 40 hours each

week. The goal was to see a 25 percent drop in body weight during the starvation period. As you can imagine, the changes were dramatic. The men became gaunt and listless, and showed a decrease in strength, heart rate, and body temperature. But the psychological effects were perhaps even more dramatic. The men became totally obsessed with food. They dreamed about it, talked about it all the time, read cookbooks. They lost interest in sex and jokes and social activities. They were irritable, anxious, and depressed. In the end, they were all rehabilitated, but the study gave us some understanding of the devastating psychological effects of starvation. It also showed us something of the social effects, as the men withdrew from one another and isolated themselves. As one fundamental

need was frustrated, these men experienced the decline of another - the need to belong. Humans are social animals. Evolutionarily speaking, it's fair to say that social bonding has helped us survive. It's a tough world out there, and we've got a lot better shot at thriving if we're sharing resources and responsibilities, protecting and supporting each other in groups. That isn't say you need to be joined at the hip with everyone--our social needs have to be balanced with our autonomy, or sense of personal control, so we feel both connected and independent. But sometimes we're denied that sense of belonging. We've all experienced the pain of being ignored or rejected at some point in our lives. It's worse than just about anything.

The evidence for this is abundant - one recent study suggested that teenagers who had a sense of belonging to their community had better health and emotional outcomes than those who didn't feel like they belonged. Cultures all over the world actually use ostracism, or social exclusion, as a type of punishment. Whether it's kids in time-out, adults in exile, or prisoners in solitary confinement, separation feels like a punch in the gut. Never underestimate the power behind what motivates us. The need to survive, the need to belong... if you can harness that motivation, you can do just about anything. Just ask Aron Ralston. If you were motivated to learn today, hopefully you took in four theories of motivation including

the evolutionary perspective, drive-reduction, optimal arousal, and Maslow's hierarchy of needs, and how sex, hunger, and the need to belong motivate us.

Mel Gibson did it, Tom Cruise nearly busted Oprah's couch doing it, and Kanye pretty much has owned it for years now. I'm talking about expressing too much emotion, usually in public and in weird and often insensitive ways. Such regrettable outbursts are not unique to celebrities, of course, and they can be enough to make us think of our emotions as irrational. But they're not... well, not usually. When they're not getting the better of us, they have work to do. Part of their job is to provide the energy and motivation that lets us meet our goals and our needs, and despite the occasional public fail, they often improve our performance in a given situation. So emotions play an important role in how we think and behave.

Of course, when they blow up and someone screams at a flight attendant or punches a paparazzo or jumps on stage and grabs the mic away from a teenager in the middle of her acceptance speech to say that someone else deserve the honor more - all hail Beyoncé - you're kind of off the rails of normal emotional function. Okay, definition time, general idea. Emotion is a mind and body's integrated response to a stimulus of some kind. Emotions involve physiological arousal, expressive behaviors and conscious experience. These can be short flashes or long, lingering responses, and they can be very clear or very confusing. Say, you're walking home at night and you hear footsteps behind you.

Physiological arousal occurs in the form of your heart pounding, your expressive behaviors could be like quickening your pace or moving toward a streetlight, and your conscious experience may include thinking "Oh I'm... I'm... gonna get mugged now? Is this like a werewolf behind me?" Feeling, you know, fear and panic. We know those three pieces are there, but psychologists are still puzzling out exactly how they fit together. How do thinking and feeling interact? Which one comes first? And do these bodily reactions - the pounding heart, the need to pee, the sweaty palms - come as a result of the thought "I"m scared", or did my tweaking out body trigger the thought in my brain?

These are just some of the questions that we'll be looking at in this messy, exhilarating, and terrifying world of emotions - no one gets out unscathed. [Intro] Our emotions represent and construct a big part of who we are. Think of how boring we would be - how boring the world would be without joy, embarrassment, heartache, or fear. What would motivate us to make decisions, be cautious, or bold, or strive to understand each other? What would keep our humanity intact? Where would punk rock come from? No doubt, we need our emotions, but how do they work? Well, like, apparently everything in psychology, there are a few different theories. In the late 1800s, pioneering American psychologist William James suggested that our feelings

follow our bodily reactions to external situations; that, for example, you feel sad because you are crying, or you're scared because you're shaking like a leaf. This idea was also proposed by Danish psychologist Carl Lange, and so, this concept that physiological arousal precedes emotion is called the James-Lange theory. But American physiologist Walter Cannon wasn't feeling it. He thought that too many of the body's reactions were too similar: a racing heart, fluttering stomach, and sweaty hands could be attributed to passion, fear, excitement, or anger. So how could they cause such different emotions? His colleague, Philip Bard, agreed, concluding that bodily responses and emotions occur separately, but simultaneously - and this idea is the base of the Cannon-Bard theory of emotion.

In other words, a racing heart doesn't cause fear, nor does the feeling of fear result in a racing heart, rather, both things just happen together. Today, most psychologists agree that our emotions are also tangled up with our cognition: whether or not we're afraid of a dog on the sidewalk depends a lot on whether we're interpreting the animal's behavior as threatening or friendly, probably also, what our personal history with dogs is. In the 1960s, American psychologist Stanley Schachter and Jerome Singer interpreted this idea that cognition can define emotion, into what they called their "two-factor theory". They believed that to experience emotion, you must both fear physiological arousal, and cognitively label that arousal.

And again, please remember that in psychology, arousal is different from how you're used to using it. Here, arousal can be thought of as activation or stress, or even energy - an increase in reactivity or wakefulness that primes us for some kind of action. So sometimes, arousal can spill over from one event to the next: say you just watched a heated soccer match, and you're all revved up, and someone looks at you funny. Suddenly, you might label that lingering arousal as anger, and the next thing you know, the whole stadium is one big rioting aggro chain reaction. Schachter and Singer examine this so-called "spillover effect" with an experiment that involved an usual combination of college guys and drugs.

First, they injected a bunch of college guys with the hormone epinephrine. This is basically adrenaline, and as you yourself have probably experienced, it induces a level of physiological activation that can go any number of ways emotionally. But then they threw a curve ball - some of the subjects were told to expect symptoms of feeling all revved up, while others were told the injection wouldn't produce any effects at all. Then, after being injected, each subject was left in a waiting room, and with them in the room was an actor, pretending to wait as well, and acting either all jerky and irritated, or super happy and euphoric. So the dude's just sitting there, jacked up on this hormone, and his heart is racing,

and his cheeks are all flushed, and in the case where the subject was told not to expect the effects, the study found that the guy would actually adopt the emotion of the actor in the room, becoming happy or testy, depending on how the person was acting. His body was having a physiological response to the hormone, but he ended up effectively deciding which emotion he was feeling. But, if the subject had been told that the injection would make him feel all pumped up, he'd actually report very little emotion, just because he was blaming that racing heart and flushed face on the drug, not a particular state of mind. So in terms of the two-factor theory, the cause of physiological arousal had to be identified before a person could feel and label the response as a particular emotion.

To Schachter, Singer, and their disciples, this meant that arousal spurs emotion, but cognition directs it. And yet, some researchers like Polish-born American psychologist Robert Zajonc, contend that all emotions are the result of just putting a name to our arousal - he suggests that many of our emotional reactions occur separately, or even before our cognition kicks in. If you hear a sudden crash outside your window, you'll automatically react with a jolt before your brain has the chance to think, "Gee, what was that crazy noise? Should I feel startled?" This is, in part, because when it comes to emotions, it's thought that our brains process sensory input by two different kinds of roots - top-down, or bottom-up approaches, and neuroscientists

can actually chart these two pathways in action. Some bigger, more complex feelings, like love and hatred take what we call the "high-road." Say, you read a love letter from your sweetie. You can pin that mushy feeling in your heart to the sensory stimulus of reading traveling from your eyes all the way through your thalamus to your brain's cortex. There, it can be analyzed by means of your cognitive process, perhaps, consciously, perhaps implicitly - and labelled with, like, "Aw, so sweet," at which point, it heads to your limbic system, the central brain region that drives emotion, motivation. At that point, you respond with all the warm-fuzzies. Other emotions, like simple likes, aversions, and fears, don't have to involve actual thinking, and take a sort of "low-road" neural path.

Like, that crash outside, or a baseball flying at your head. Such "jump-out-of-your-chair" stimuli bypass the cortex and zip right from the ear or the eye to the amygdala in the limbic system. It's a knee-jerk reaction that allows us to react quickly, often in the face of potential danger. In other words, that slower, high-road cortex route allows thinking about feeling, while the quick low-road shortcut allows instant emotional reaction. The stomach flip that happens when you see your ex, or the ten thousand pee breaks you gotta take before you give a speech, or your heart racing after a really good kiss - it's hard to argue with the fact that we often feel emotions with our bodies as much as with our brains.

And you can thank your autonomic nervous system the next time you're freaking out or trying to calm yourself down. Perhaps, you recall when we talked about the roles of the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of our autonomic nervous system. The sympathetic division is what arouses you in a crisis - it makes you hyper aware, makes your heart rate and breathing increase, spikes your blood sugar for extra energy - all that fun stuff. It's like a pit crew readying you for action, and once it's done its job and the danger has passed, the parasympathetic division steps in and talks you back down from the edge, slowing down your heart and breathing rates, and shutting off those stress hormones.

Generally, rubbing your back and being all, "Everything's gonna be okay, baby." What you need is the right degree of arousal for the situation: for example, if you're navigating through fast moving traffic in an unfamiliar city, you wanna hit the sweet spot of optimal arousal that allows you to focus your attention without either freaking out or getting all mellow and sleepy. Like we said before, there's a lot of overlap in the symptoms of different emotions. If you monitor the heart rate, breathing, and perspiration of a group of people who are watching three different movies, you probably couldn't tell who was watching the grisly horror movie, an angry fight, or a hot sex scene.

Fear, anger, and sexual arousal often deliver some of the same biological signals. But those emotions certainly feel different to the people experiencing them, just as they usually look different to others observing their expressions. And though differences in emotion can appear subtle, or even undetectable on brain scans, many of them do show distinctive patterns. For most people, positive feelings tend to show more activity in the left frontal lobe, while negative ones show up more in the right frontal lobe. And someone who's very afraid will show increased activity in the amygdala, our more primal emotional center. Emotions are fascinating things that drive us to do all sorts of brilliant and weird stuff.

Understanding them and being able to read them both in yourself and others is vital if you wanna make it through even an average day. But misreading your emotions or someone else's can be confusing - even dangerous - and it's just one of the things that we'll be looking at next week. Today, you learned about what emotions are, how they work, and why we need them. We talked about the James-Lange, Cannon-Bard, Schachter & Singer, and Zajonc theories, and we also looked at the relationship between cognition and emotion, and how the autonomic nervous system mobilizes emotion.

### Transcript (navigation)

- [00:00] Mel Gibson did it, Tom Cruise nearly busted Oprah's couch doing it, and Kanye pretty much
- [00:05] has owned it for years now.
- [00:06] I'm talking about expressing too much emotion, usually in public and in weird and often insensitive
- [00:13] ways.
- [00:14] Such regrettable outbursts are not unique to celebrities, of course, and they can be
- [00:17] enough to make us think of our emotions as irrational.
- [00:21] But they're not...
- [00:22] well, not usually.
- [00:24] When they're not getting the better of us, they have work to do.
- [00:27] Part of their job is to provide the energy and motivation that lets us meet our goals
- [00:31] and our needs, and despite the occasional public fail, they often improve our performance
- [00:36] in a given situation.
- [00:37] So emotions play an important role in how we think and behave.
- [00:41] Of course, when they blow up and someone screams at a flight attendant or punches a paparazzo
- [00:45] or jumps on stage and grabs the mic away from a teenager in the middle of her acceptance
- [00:49] speech to say that someone else deserve the honor more - all hail Beyoncé - you're kind
- [00:53] of off the rails of normal emotional function.
- [00:55] Okay, definition time, general idea.
- [00:59] Emotion is a mind and body's integrated response to a stimulus of some kind.
- [01:04] Emotions involve physiological arousal, expressive behaviors and conscious experience.
- [01:08] These can be short flashes or long, lingering responses, and they can be very clear or very
- [01:13] confusing.
- [01:14] Say, you're walking home at night and you hear footsteps behind you.
- [01:18] Physiological arousal occurs in the form of your heart pounding, your expressive behaviors
- [01:22] could be like quickening your pace or moving toward a streetlight, and your conscious experience
- [01:27] may include thinking "Oh I'm...
- [01:29] I'm... gonna get mugged now?
- [01:31] Is this like a werewolf behind me?"
- [01:33] Feeling, you know, fear and panic.
- [01:34] We know those three pieces are there, but psychologists are still puzzling out exactly
- [01:38] how they fit together.
- [01:39] How do thinking and feeling interact?
- [01:42] Which one comes first?
- [01:43] And do these bodily reactions - the pounding heart, the need to pee, the sweaty palms - come
- [01:48] as a result of the thought "I"m scared", or did my tweaking out body trigger the thought
- [01:53] in my brain?

- [02:26] each other?
