### Transcript (reading)

That dream about the dinosaur in the leotard, those times that you said that thing that you know you shouldn't have said, or even that thing you didn't even know you were gonna say. The little cogs of your consciousness cranking away, making your life possible, making society function, all of the things that you're so glad you can do and all of the ones that you wish you could stop doing. Excluding other human minds, your mind is the most complicated piece of the universe that humans currently know about. The rules that govern it are mysterious and elusive. Maybe our brains just aren't complex enough to understand themselves. But that's not going to stop us from trying! The word 'psychology' comes from the Latin for the "study of the soul." And while its

formal definition has evolved over the last several decades, today we can safely call it the science of behavior and mental processes. The term 'psychology' wasn't coined until around the turn of the sixteenth century, and the practice that we would actually call science today wasn't established until the mid-1800s. But of course, humans have always been curious about themselves and what's going on up here. Aristotle pondered the seed of human consciousness and decided that it was in the heart, not the head -- being, as we have seen quite a lot here on Crash Course, absolutely and completely wrong. Two thousand years ago, Chinese rulers conducted the world's first psychological exams, requiring

public officials to take personality and intelligence tests. And in the late 800s, Persian doctor Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Rhazes, also known as Rhazes, was one of the first to describe mental illness, and even treated patients in what was essentially a very early psych ward in his Baghdad hospital. From the efforts of those early thinkers up until today, the field of psychology has been all about tackling some of the big questions: How can humans do horrible things like commit genocide and torture other humans, and how come we know those things are horrible? Do we have free will, or are we simply driven by our environment, biology, and non-conscious influences? What is mental illness, and what can we do about it? And what is consciousness?

Or the notion of self? If I lose my awareness of myself, am I still human? I DON'T KNOW! But over the next 6 months, these are the questions that we're gonna be exploring together: how our brains work, how they can break, how they can be healed, why we behave the way we do, even when we don't want to, and what it means to be thinking and feeling and alive. [Intro] When hearing the word psychology, most people probably think of a therapist listening to a patient unpacking the details of his day while reclining on a couch. Maybe that therapist is wearing glasses, chewing on a cigar, stroking his whiskered chin. Admit it! If you're thinking about psychology, you're probably picturing Freud.

Sigmund Freud was one of the most tremendously influential and controversial thinkers of his time, maybe of all time. His theories helped build our views on childhood, personality, dreams and sexuality. And his work fueled a legacy of both support and opposition. His life was long and spanned an important swath of history from the American Civil War to World War II. But like most great scientists, Freud developed his revolutionary ideas by building on the work of others, and of course innovation in the field didn't stop with him. In truth, psychology is one of the most wildly diverse sciences in terms of the questions it proposes, the methods it applies, and the different schools of thought and disciplines it contains.

Perhaps more than any other science, psychology is just a big old integrated melting pot. For instance, right around Freud's time, there were a lot of different schools of thought of about how the study of the human mind should be tackled. Mainly, there were the ideas of structuralism, functionalism and psychoanalysis. Scientific psychology got its start in 1879 in Germany when physician Wilhelm Wundt set up the first psychology laboratory at the University of Leipzig just a few years after publishing his Principles of Physiological Psychology, considered the first true psychology textbook. Wundt and his student Edward Bradford Titchener took cues from chemists and physicists and argued that if those people could break down all matter into simple elements or structures,

why couldn't they do the same for the brain? They tried to understand the structures of consciousness by getting patients to look inward, asking them how they felt when they watched the sun set, or smelled a coffee, or licked a kitten, or whatever. Titchener named this approach 'structuralism', but despite its rigid sounding name, it really relied so much on introspection that it became too subjective. I mean, you may sense and feel something different that I do, even if we lick the same kitten. Psychologists, of course, can't actually observe a patient's inner thoughts or feelings, so ultimately, the structuralist school of thought was fairly short-lived. By contrast, American physician and philosopher William James proposed a different set of

questions, focusing on why we think and feel and smell and lick, or whatever. Basically, he focused on the function of behavior. This approach, 'functionalism', was based on Charles Darwin's idea that adaptive behaviors are conserved throughout the evolutionary process. James published his seminal book, The Principles of Psychology, in 1890, defining psychology as the science of mental life, just as Freud was starting to flex his big brain. Sigmund Freud began his medical career at a Viennese hospital, but in 1886, he started his own practice, specializing in nervous disorders. During this time, Freud witnessed his colleague Josef Breuer treat a patient called Anna O with a new talking cure. Basically,

he just let her talk about her symptoms. The more she talked and pulled up traumatic memories, the more her symptoms were reduced. It was a breakthrough, and it changed Freud forever. From then on, Freud encouraged his patients to talk freely about whatever came to mind, to free associate. This technique provided the basis for his career, and an entire branch of psychology. In 1900 he published his book The Interpretation of Dreams, where he introduced his theory of psychoanalysis. Now, you probably think of psychoanalysis as a treatment -- the whole patient on the couch scenario. And that's definitely part of it. But Freud's concept was actually a lot more complex than that, and it was revolutionary.

A radical kernel of psychoanalysis was the theory that our personalities are shaped by unconscious motives. Basically Freud suggested that we're all profoundly affected by mental processes that we're not even aware of. Now that sounds almost obvious to us now, but part of the genius of Freud's theory was that in 1900, it wasn't obvious at all. The idea that our minds could be driven by something that our minds themselves didn't know about was hard to grasp. As hard as like, uhh, maybe organisms evolving by natural selection. It was abstract, invisible, and there was something about it that seemed irrational. But the other important part of Freud's theory was that the unconscious, literally the thing

below consciousness, was still discoverable. Even though you weren't aware of it, you could come to understand it through a therapeutic technique that used dreams, projections and free association to root out repressed feelings and and gain self-insight. So what Freud was really saying was that mental disorders could be healed through talk therapy and self-discovery. And this was a really big breakthrough. Because prior to this, people with mental illnesses would be confined to sanatoriums and at best given menial labor to do and at worst, shackled to a bed frame. After The Interpretations of Dreams, Freud went on to publish over 20 more books and countless papers with an iconic cigar in hand all the while. He believed smoking helped

him think, but it also helped him get jaw cancer. During the last sixteen years of his life, he underwent at least thirty painful operations while continuing to smoke. By the late 1930s, the Nazis had taken over Austria, and Freud and his Jewish family narrowly escaped to England. By September 1939, the pain in his cancerous jaw was too great and a doctor friend assisted him in suicide through morphine injection. He was eighty-three. Whether you love him or hate him - and make no mistake, plenty of people vehemently disagreed with him - there is no question that Freud's impact on psychology was monumental. While competing theories in the young field of psychology either fell away or evolved into something else, psychoanalysis remains an important concept and practice today.

The next big shake-up rolled in during the first half of the 20th century when behaviorism gained a higher profile. Heavy hitters like Ivan Pavlov, John B. Watson, and B. F. Skinner were key players here. They focused on the study of observable behavior. You may remember Skinner as the dude who put rats and pigeons and babies in boxes and conditioned them to perform certain behaviors. Right around when Freud escaped to England, Skinner published his Behavior of Organisms, ushering in the era of behaviorism which remained all the rage well into the 1960s. The other major force at the time was, of course, Freud's psychoanalysis, and its many descendents collectively known as the psychodynamic theories. These focused on the importance

of early experiences in shaping the unconsciousness and how that process affects our thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and personalities. By the mid-20th century, other major forces in psychology were also brewing -- schools we'll explore later in this course including humanist psychology, which focuses on nurturing personal growth; cognitive science and neuroscience, all of which contributed their own unique takes on the study of mind. Today's formal definition of psychology, the study of behavior and mental processes, is a nice amalgamation that pulls from all these different schools of thought. It recognizes the need for observing and recording behavior, whether that's screaming, crying or playing air saxophone to an imaginary audience, but it also gives credit to our mental processes:

what we think and feel and believe while we're tearing it up on our invisible instruments. Because again, the point I really want you to take home is that psychology is an integrative science. Yes, folks still get grumpy and disagree plenty, but the essence of the discipline has everything to do with creating different ways of asking interesting questions and attempting to answer them through all kinds of data-gathering methods. The human mind is complicated. There is no single way to effectively crack it open; it must be pried at from all sides. Harvard astronomer Owen Gingerich has gazed into the distant horizon of space, and even he has acknowledged that the human brain is by far the most complex physical object known

to us in the entire cosmos. And we all get to have one! Of our very own! Just knocking around right up in here. We here at Crash Course are really excited to spend the next several months delving into the world of psychology -- how it applies to our lives, our minds, and our hearts, and how it deepens our understanding of each other, our world, and ourselves. Thanks for watching this first lesson in Crash Course Psychology, and I'd like to especially thank all of our Subbable subscribers, without whom we would literally not be able to do this.

### Transcript (reading)

Can week-old pizza cause psychedelic hallucinations? Does coffee make you smarter? Or does it just make you do dumb stuff faster? Like a bunch of psychology itself, questions like this can seem pretty intuitive. I mean, people may not be the easiest organisms to understand, but you're a person, right? So you must be qualified to draw, like, some conclusions about other people and what makes them tick. But it's important to realize that your intuition isn't always right. In fact, sometimes it is exactly wrong, and we tend to grossly underestimate the dangers of false intuition. If you have an idea about a person and their behavior that turns out to be right, that reinforces your trust in your intuition.

Like if one of my buddies, Bob, begins eating that deep-dish pizza that's been in the fridge for the past week but he eats it anyway and soon starts to wig out, I'll say "Dude, I told you so". But if I'm wrong and he's totally fine, I probably won't even think about it ever again. This is known as 'Hindsight Bias" or the "I-Knew-It-All-Along" phenomenon. This doesn't mean the common sense is wrong, it just means that our intuitive sense more easily describes what just happened, than what will happen in the future. Another reason you can't blindly trust your intuition is your natural tendency toward overconfidence. Sometimes, you just really, really feel like you're right about people when actually you're really, really wrong.

We've all been there. We also tend to perceive order in random events, which can lead to false assumptions. For example, if you flip a coin five times you have equal chances of getting all tails as you do getting alternating heads and tails. But we see the series of five tails as something unusual, as a streak, and thus giving that result some kind of meaning that it very definitely does not have. That is why we have the methods and safe-guards of psychological research and experimentation, and the glorious process of scientific inquiry. They help us to get around these problems and basically save the study of our minds from the stupidity of our minds. So I hope that it won't be a spoiler if I tell you now that pizza won't make you trip, and coffee doesn't make you smart.

Sorry. [Intro] In most ways psychological research is no different than any other scientific discipline, like step one is always figuring out how to ask general questions about your subject and turn them into measurable, testable propositions. This is called operationalizing your questions. So you know how the scientific method works -- it starts with a question and a theory, and I don't mean theory in the sense of like, a hunch that say, a quad-shot of espresso makes you think better. Instead, in science a theory is what explains and organizes lots of different observations and predicts outcomes. And when you come up with a testable prediction, that's your hypothesis. Once your theory and hypothesis are in place, you need a clear and common language to report

them with, so for example, defining exactly what you mean by "thinking better" with your espresso hypothesis will allow other researchers to replicate the experiment. And replication is key. You can watch a person exhibit a certain behavior once, and it won't prove very much, but if you keep getting consistent results, even as you change subjects or situations, you're probably on to something. This is a problem with one popular type of psychological research: case studies, which take an in-depth look at one individual. Case studies can sometimes be misleading, because by their nature, they can't be replicated, so they run the risk of over-generalizing. Still, they're good at showing us what CAN happen, and end up framing questions for more extensive and generalizable studies.

They're also often memorable and a great story telling device psychologists use to observe and describe behavior. Like, say the smell of coffee makes Carl suddenly anxious and irritable -- that obviously doesn't mean that it has that same effect on everyone. In fact, Carl has terrible memories associated with that smell, and so his case is actually quite rare. Poor Carl. But you would still have to look at lots of other cases to determine that conclusively. Another popular method of psychological research is naturalistic observation, where researchers simply watch behavior in a natural environment, whether that's chimps poking ant-hills in the jungle, kids clowning in a classroom or drunk dudes yelling at soccer games.

The idea is to let the subjects just do their thing without trying to manipulate or control the situation. So yeah, basically just spying on people. Like case studies, naturalistic observations are great at describing behavior, but they're very limited in explaining it. Psychologists can also collect behavioral data using surveys or interviews, asking people to report their opinions and behaviors. Sexuality researcher Alfred Kinsey famously used this technique when he surveyed thousands of men and women on their sexual history and published his findings in a pair of revolutionary texts, Sexual Behavior in the Human Male and Female respectively. Surveys are a great way to access consciously held attitudes and beliefs, but how to ask

the questions can be tricky; subtle word choices can influence results. For example more forceful words like "ban" or "censor" may elicit different reactions than "limit" or "not allow". Asking "Do you believe in space aliens?" is a much different question than "Do you think that there is intelligent life somewhere else in the universe?" It's the same question, but in the first the subject might assume you mean aliens visiting earth, and making crop circles and abducting people and poking them. And if how you phrase surveys is important, so is who you ask. I could ask a room full of students at a pacifist club meeting what they think about arms control, but the result wouldn't be a representative measure of where students stand, because there's a pretty clear sampling bias at work here.

To fairly represent a population, I'd need to get a random sample where all members of the target group, in this case students, had an equal chance of being selected to answer the question. So once you've described behavior with surveys, case studies, or naturalistic observation, you can start making sense out of it, and even predict future behavior. One way to do that is to look at one trait or behavior is related to another, or how they correlate. So let's get back to my buddy Bob who seems to think that his refrigerator is actually some kind of time machine that can preserve food indefinitely. Let's say that Bob has just tucked into a lunch of questionable leftovers, pizza that may very well have had a little bit of fungus on it.

But he was hungry, and lazy, and so he doused it in Sriracha. Suddenly, he starts seeing things: green armadillos with laser beam eyes. From here we could deduce that eating unknown fungus predicts hallucination, that's a correlation. But correlation is not causation. Yes, it makes sense that eating questionable fungus would cause hallucinations, but it's possible that Bob was already on the verge of a psychotic episode, and those fuzzy leftovers were actually benign. Or there could be an entirely different factor involved, like maybe he hadn't slept in 72 hours, or had an intense migraine coming on, and one of those factors caused his hallucinations. It's tempting to draw conclusions from correlations, but it's super-important to remember that

correlations predict the possibility of cause-and-effect relationships; they cannot prove them. So we've talked about how to describe behavior without manipulating it and how to make connections and predictions from those findings. But that can only take you so far; to really get to the bottom of cause-and-effect behaviors, you're gonna have to start experimenting. Experiments allow investigators to isolate different effects by manipulating an independent variable, and keeping all other variables constant, or as constant as you can. This means that they need at least two groups: the experimental group, which is gonna get messed with, and the control group, which is not gonna get messed with.

Just as surveys use random samples, experimental researchers need to randomly assign participants to each group to minimize potential confounding variables, or outside factors that may skew the results. You don't want all grumpy teenagers in one group and all wealthy Japanese surfers in the other; they gotta mingle. Now sometimes one or both groups are not informed about what's actually being tested. For example, researchers can test how substances effect people by comparing their effects to placebos, or inert substances. And often, the researchers themselves don't know which group is experimental and which is control, so they don't unintentionally influence the results through their own behavior, in which case it's called, you guessed it, a double blind procedure.

So let's put these ideas into practice in our own little experiment. Like all good work, it starts with a question. So the other day my friend Bernice and I were debating. We were debating caffeine's effect on the brain. Personally, she convinced that coffee helps her focus and think better, but I get all jittery like a caged meerkat and can't focus on anything. And because we know that overconfidence can lead you to believe things that are not true, we decided to use some critical thinking. So let's figure out our question: "Do humans solve problems faster when given caffeine?" Now we gotta boil that down into a testable prediction. Remember: keep it clear, simple, and eloquent so that it can be replicated.

"Caffeine makes me smarter" is not a great hypothesis. A better one would be, say, "Adult humans given caffeine will navigate a maze faster than humans not given caffeine." The caffeine dosage is your independent variable, the thing that you can change. So, you'll need some coffee. Your result or dependent variable, the thing that depends on the thing that you can change is going to be the speed at which the subject navigates through this giant corn maze. Go out on the street, wrangle up a bunch of different kinds of people and randomly assign them into three different groups. Also at this point, the American Psychological Association suggests that you acquire everyone's informed consent to participate.

You don't want to force anyone to be in your experiment, no matter how cool you think it is. So the control group gets a placebo, in this case decaf. Experimental group one gets a low dose of caffeine, which we'll define at a 100 milligrams; just an eye opener, like, a cup of coffee's worth. Experimental group two gets 500 milligrams, more than a quad shot of espresso dunked in a Red Bull. Once you dose everyone, turn them lose in the maze and wait at the other end with a stopwatch. All that's left is to measure your results from the three different groups and compare them to see if there were any conclusive results. If the highly dosed folks got through it twice as fast as the low dose and the placebo groups,

then Bernice's hypothesis was correct, and she can rub my face in it saying she was right all along, but really that would just be the warm flush of hindsight bias telling her something she didn't really know until we tested it. Then, because we've used clear language and defined our parameters, other curious minds can easily replicate this experiment, and we can eventually pool all the data together and have something solid to say about what that macchiato was doing to your cognition– or at least the speed at which you can run through a maze.

### Transcript (navigation)

- [00:00] Can week-old pizza cause psychedelic hallucinations?
- [00:02] Does coffee make you smarter?
- [00:04] Or does it just make you do dumb stuff faster?
- [00:06] Like a bunch of psychology itself, questions like this can seem pretty intuitive.
- [00:09] I mean, people may not be the easiest organisms to understand, but you're a person, right?
- [00:13] So you must be qualified to draw, like, some conclusions about other people and what makes
- [00:18] them tick.
- [00:19] But it's important to realize that your intuition isn't always right.
- [00:22] In fact, sometimes it is exactly wrong, and we tend to grossly underestimate the dangers
- [00:27] of false intuition.
- [00:28] If you have an idea about a person and their behavior that turns out to be right, that
- [00:32] reinforces your trust in your intuition.
- [00:34] Like if one of my buddies, Bob, begins eating that deep-dish pizza that's been in the fridge
- [00:38] for the past week but he eats it anyway and soon starts to wig out, I'll say "Dude, I
- [00:42] told you so".
- [00:43] But if I'm wrong and he's totally fine, I probably won't even think about it ever again.
- [00:49] This is known as 'Hindsight Bias" or the "I-Knew-It-All-Along" phenomenon.
- [00:52] This doesn't mean the common sense is wrong, it just means that our intuitive sense more
- [00:56] easily describes what just happened, than what will happen in the future.
- [01:00] Another reason you can't blindly trust your intuition is your natural tendency toward
- [01:04] overconfidence.
- [01:05] Sometimes, you just really, really feel like you're right about people when actually you're
- [01:11] really, really wrong.
- [01:12] We've all been there.
- [01:13] We also tend to perceive order in random events, which can lead to false assumptions.
- [01:18] For example, if you flip a coin five times you have equal chances of getting all tails
- [01:22] as you do getting alternating heads and tails.
- [01:25] But we see the series of five tails as something unusual, as a streak, and thus giving that
- [01:30] result some kind of meaning that it very definitely does not have.
- [01:33] That is why we have the methods and safe-guards of psychological research and experimentation,
- [01:39] and the glorious process of scientific inquiry.
- [01:42] They help us to get around these problems and basically save the study of our minds
- [01:46] from the stupidity of our minds.
- [01:48] So I hope that it won't be a spoiler if I tell you now that pizza won't make you trip,
- [01:53] and coffee doesn't make you smart.
- [01:59] Sorry.
- [02:01] [Intro]
- [02:04] In most ways psychological research is no different than any other scientific discipline,
- [02:10] like step one is always figuring out how to ask general questions about your subject and
- [02:15] turn them into measurable, testable propositions.
- [02:18] This is called operationalizing your questions.
- [02:21] So you know how the scientific method works -- it starts with a question and a theory,
- [02:25] and I don't mean theory in the sense of like, a hunch that say, a quad-shot of espresso
- [02:29] makes you think better.
- [02:31] Instead, in science a theory is what explains and organizes lots of different observations
- [02:36] and predicts outcomes.
- [02:37] And when you come up with a testable prediction, that's your hypothesis.
- [02:41] Once your theory and hypothesis are in place, you need a clear and common language to report
- [02:45] them with, so for example, defining exactly what you mean by "thinking better" with your
- [02:49] espresso hypothesis will allow other researchers to replicate the experiment.
- [02:53] And replication is key.
- [02:55] You can watch a person exhibit a certain behavior once, and it won't prove very much, but if
- [03:00] you keep getting consistent results, even as you change subjects or situations, you're
- [03:04] probably on to something.
- [03:05] This is a problem with one popular type of psychological research: case studies, which
- [03:10] take an in-depth look at one individual.
- [03:13] Case studies can sometimes be misleading, because by their nature, they can't be replicated,
- [03:17] so they run the risk of over-generalizing.
- [03:18] Still, they're good at showing us what CAN happen, and end up framing questions for more
- [03:23] extensive and generalizable studies.
- [03:25] They're also often memorable and a great story telling device psychologists use to observe
- [03:29] and describe behavior.
- [03:30] Like, say the smell of coffee makes Carl suddenly anxious and irritable -- that obviously doesn't
- [03:36] mean that it has that same effect on everyone.
- [03:37] In fact, Carl has terrible memories associated with that smell, and so his case is actually
- [03:42] quite rare.
- [03:44] Poor Carl.

### Transcript (reading)

Say it's late at night, you're home alone drifting off to sleep, just, entering that dream about Fritos, and then suddenly there's a banging at the door! Suddenly you're wide awake and it feels like your heart's gonna explode. You jump up ready to run out the back door, possibly grab a Phillips head screwdriver and stab it into the darkness until it sticks into something. Now whether it's a Weeping Angel or your neighbor looking to borrow a can of beans, it doesn't really matter because when you heard that sudden noise, your startled brain released an icy typhoon of chemicals. And everything that's now going through your mind, like your urge to flee, your urge to defend yourself, that internal debate about whether Weeping Angels are even real and "Woah!

Where's the cat?" All that? Is just a result of those chemicals. Our brains and our nervous systems and the substances they produce and are always bathed in are amazingly complex nuanced systems. And even though we're always talking about our mental activities being somehow separate from all the biological stuff going on in our bodies, in reality, the moods, ideas, impulses, that flash through our minds are spurred by our biological condition. As psychologists like to say, "Everything psychological is biological." So one way to understand how your mind works is to look at how the chemistry of your body influences how you think, sense, and feel about the world around you.

To do that, we begin at the simplest level, the system with the smallest parts, it's all about the neuron, baby. [Intro] Neurons, or nerve cells, are the building blocks that comprise our nervous systems. Neurons share the same basic makeup as our other cells, but they have electrochemical mojo that lets them transmit messages to each other. Your brain alone is made up of billions of neurons, and to understand why we think or dream or do anything, you gotta first understand how these little transmitters work. You actually have several different types of neurons in your body, from ones that are less than a millimeter long in your brain to ones that run the whole length of your leg!

Yes, you have cells as long as your legs, which is nothing compared to the hundred and fifty feet the nerve cells of some dinosaurs had to be, I'm getting off topic, sorry. No matter how big a nerve is, they all have the same three basic parts: the soma, dendrites, and axon. The soma, or cell body, is basically the neuron's life support; it contains all that necessary cell action like the nucleus, DNA, mitochondria, ribosomes, and such. So, if the soma dies, the whole neuron goes with it. The dendrites, as bushy and branch-like as the trees they're named after, receive messages and gossip from other cells. They're the listeners, whispering what they hear back to the soma.

The axon is the talker. This long, cable-like extension transmits electrical impulses from the cell body out to other neurons or glands or muscles. Whereas the dendrites are short and bushy, the axon fiber is long, and, depending on what type of neuron it is, is sometimes encased in a protective layer of fatty tissue, called the myelin sheath. It's almost like an insulated electrical wire, the myelin sheath speeds up the transmission of messages, and if it degrades, as it does with those affected with multiple sclerosis, those signals are degraded as well, eventually leading to lack of muscle control. Neurons transmit signals either when stimulated by sensory input or triggered by neighboring neurons.

The dendrites pick up the signal and activate the neuron's action potential, or firing impulse, that shoots an electrical charge down the axon to its terminals and towards the neighboring neurons. The contact points between neurons are called synapses. All those bushy little dendrites are decorated with synapses that almost but don't quite touch the neighboring axon in the tiniest game of "I'm not touching you!" of all time. They're less than a millionth of an inch apart. And that microscopic cleft is called the synaptic gap. So, when an action potential runs down to the end of an axon, it activates the chemical messengers that jump that tiny synaptic gap, flying like that little air kiss and landing on the receptor sites of the receiving neuron.

Those messengers are neurotransmitters. Although neurotransmitters slide right into their intended receptors like a key into a lock, they don't stay bonded to the receiving neuron. They just sort of pop out, having excited or inhibited the receiving neuron's trigger, then the extras immediately get reabsorbed by the neuron that released them in the first place in a process called reuptake. Kinda like, "Here you go, oh, psych!" So neurons communicate with neurotransmitters which in turn cause motion and emotion; they help us move around, make jazz hands, learn, feel, remember, stay alert, get sleepy, and pretty much do everything we do. Some of them just make you feel good, like the endorphins we get flooded with after running

ten miles or falling in love or eating a really good piece of pie. We've got over 100 different kinds of these brilliant neurotransmitters -- some are excitatory and others are inhibitory, and all are good reminders that everything psychological is also biological. Excitatory neurotransmitters rev up the neuron, increasing the chances it will fire off an action potential. Norepinephrine is one you're probably familiar with, it helps control alertness and arousal. Glutamate is another, involved in memory, but an over-supply of it can wig out the brain and cause seizures and migraines which is why some people are sensitive to all that MSG, or monosodium glutamate, in their Ramen.

Inhibitory neurotransmitters on the other hand, chill neurons out, decreasing the likelihood that the neuron will jump into action. GABA– gamma-aminobutyric acid– is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter, and you've probably heard of serotonin which affects your mood and hunger and sleep. Low amounts of serotonin are linked to depression, and a certain class of antidepressants help raise serotonin levels in the brain. Some neurotransmitters like acetylcholine and dopamine play both sides and can both excite or inhibit neurons depending on what type of receptors they encounter. Acetylcholine enables muscle action and influences learning and memory; Alzheimer's patients experience a deterioration of their acetylcholine producing neurons.

Dopamine, meanwhile, is associated with learning, movement, and pleasurable emotions, and excessive amounts of it are linked to schizophrenia as well as addictive and impulsive behavior. So neurotransmitters are basically your nervous system's couriers. But they aren't the only chemical messengers delivering the news; they've got some competition brewing in the endocrine system. And if you've been through puberty, you know what I'm talking about: hormones. Like neurotransmitters, hormones act on the brain, and indeed some of them are chemically identical to certain neurotransmitters. Hormones affect our moods, arousal, and circadian rhythm, they regulate our metabolism, monitor our immune system, signal growth, and help with sexual reproduction.

You could say that most of them boil down to the basics: attraction, appetite, and aggression. Whereas neurons and synapses flick on and off, sending messages with amazing speed, the endocrine system likes to take its time, delivering the body's slow chemical communications through a set of glands that secrete hormones into the bloodstream where they're ferried to other tissues, especially the brain. So while the nervous and endocrine systems are similar, in that they both produce chemicals destined to hit up certain receptors, they operate at very different speeds. It's like, if the nervous system wants to get in touch with you, it sends you a text. But if the endocrine system has a message, it will like lick the stamp, and put it on,

and write your address, and then a note and a pen on paper, and then fold it up and put and mail it to you with the Post Office. But fast isn't always better, and your body will remember that letter longer than the text. Hormones, they linger. Which helps explain why it takes some time to simmer down after a moment of severe fright or anger. And our endocrine systems have a few important hormone brewing glands. We've got a pair of adrenal glands snuggled up against our kidneys that secrete adrenaline, that famous fight or flight hormone that jacks up your heart rate, blood pressure and blood sugar, giving you that tidal wave of energy preparing you to run like heck or punch that charging baboon in the throat; the pancreas sits right next to the adrenal gland and oozes

insulin and glucagon hormones that monitor how you absorb sugar, your bodies main source of fuel. Your thyroid and parathyroid glands at the base of your throat secrete hormones that regulate your metabolism and monitor your body's calcium levels; if you have testicles, they're secreting your sex hormones like estrogen and testosterone, and if you've got ovaries, they're doing that job. And all those glands are super important, but there is one gland that rules them all, and in the darkness binds them: the pituitary gland. Although it's just a little pea-sized nugget hidden deep in the bunker of the brain, it is the most influential gland in this system. It releases a vital growth hormone that spurs physical development and that love hormone,

oxytocin, that promotes warm, fuzzy feelings of trust and social bonding. What really makes the pituitary the master gland is that its secretions boss around the other endocrine glands, but even the pituitary has a master in the hypothalamus region of the brain, which we will talk more about next episode. So, AHHHHHHHHH! if I managed to scare you, sorry, but I'm illustrating a point. You have no control over being scared, but maybe now you do understand a little more clearly how your nervous and endocrine systems worked together to call the shots. First, the sensory input from your eyes and ears went to your brain, the simplest bits of your hypothalamus without even letting you analyze it and were like ahhhh, and then,

that ran down the chain of command from your pituitary to your adrenal glands, to the hormone adrenaline, to the rest of your body and then back to your brain, which then realized that I was just messing with you and told everybody to just calm down for once! The whole deal is a feedback loop: your nervous system directs your endocrine system which directs your nervous system, brain, gland, hormone, brain. And of course each of these systems is fantastically complex. Way more than we can get into here. So, in our next lesson, we're gonna get all up in your brain, and delve deeper into the different components of your nervous system, find out what your old brain is, and learn about how much of your brain you actually use.

### Transcript (navigation)

- [00:00] Say it's late at night, you're home alone drifting off to sleep, just, entering that
- [00:06] dream about Fritos, and then suddenly there's a banging at the door!
- [00:10] Suddenly you're wide awake and it feels like your heart's gonna explode.
- [00:13] You jump up ready to run out the back door, possibly grab a Phillips head screwdriver
- [00:17] and stab it into the darkness until it sticks into something.
- [00:20] Now whether it's a Weeping Angel or your neighbor looking to borrow a can of beans, it doesn't
- [00:24] really matter because when you heard that sudden noise, your startled brain released
- [00:28] an icy typhoon of chemicals.
- [00:31] And everything that's now going through your mind, like your urge to flee, your urge to
- [00:34] defend yourself, that internal debate about whether Weeping Angels are even real and "Woah!
- [00:39] Where's the cat?"
- [00:40] All that?
- [00:41] Is just a result of those chemicals.
- [00:43] Our brains and our nervous systems and the substances they produce and are always bathed
- [00:47] in are amazingly complex nuanced systems.
- [00:50] And even though we're always talking about our mental activities being somehow separate
- [00:53] from all the biological stuff going on in our bodies, in reality, the moods, ideas,
- [00:58] impulses, that flash through our minds are spurred by our biological condition.
- [01:03] As psychologists like to say, "Everything psychological is biological."
- [01:07] So one way to understand how your mind works is to look at how the chemistry of your body
- [01:10] influences how you think, sense, and feel about the world around you.
- [01:15] To do that, we begin at the simplest level, the system with the smallest parts, it's all
- [01:20] about the neuron, baby.
- [01:26] [Intro]
- [01:29] Neurons, or nerve cells, are the building blocks that comprise our nervous systems.
- [01:36] Neurons share the same basic makeup as our other cells, but they have electrochemical
- [01:39] mojo that lets them transmit messages to each other.
- [01:42] Your brain alone is made up of billions of neurons, and to understand why we think or
- [01:46] dream or do anything, you gotta first understand how these little transmitters work.
- [01:51] You actually have several different types of neurons in your body, from ones that are
- [01:54] less than a millimeter long in your brain to ones that run the whole length of your
- [01:58] leg!
- [01:59] Yes, you have cells as long as your legs, which is nothing compared to the hundred and
- [02:03] fifty feet the nerve cells of some dinosaurs had to be, I'm getting off topic, sorry.
- [02:08] No matter how big a nerve is, they all have the same three basic parts: the soma, dendrites,
- [02:14] and axon.
- [02:15] The soma, or cell body, is basically the neuron's life support; it contains all that necessary
- [02:20] cell action like the nucleus, DNA, mitochondria, ribosomes, and such.
- [02:24] So, if the soma dies, the whole neuron goes with it.
- [02:27] The dendrites, as bushy and branch-like as the trees they're named after, receive messages
- [02:32] and gossip from other cells.
- [02:34] They're the listeners, whispering what they hear back to the soma.
- [02:37] The axon is the talker.
- [02:38] This long, cable-like extension transmits electrical impulses from the cell body out
- [02:43] to other neurons or glands or muscles.
- [02:46] Whereas the dendrites are short and bushy, the axon fiber is long, and, depending on
- [02:50] what type of neuron it is, is sometimes encased in a protective layer of fatty tissue, called
- [02:55] the myelin sheath.
- [02:56] It's almost like an insulated electrical wire, the myelin sheath speeds up the transmission
- [03:00] of messages, and if it degrades, as it does with those affected with multiple sclerosis,
- [03:05] those signals are degraded as well, eventually leading to lack of muscle control.
- [03:09] Neurons transmit signals either when stimulated by sensory input or triggered by neighboring
- [03:14] neurons.
- [03:15] The dendrites pick up the signal and activate the neuron's action potential, or firing impulse,
- [03:19] that shoots an electrical charge down the axon to its terminals and towards the neighboring
- [03:24] neurons.
- [03:25] The contact points between neurons are called synapses.
- [03:27] All those bushy little dendrites are decorated with synapses that almost but don't quite
- [03:32] touch the neighboring axon in the tiniest game of "I'm not touching you!" of all time.
- [03:38] They're less than a millionth of an inch apart.
- [03:40] And that microscopic cleft is called the synaptic gap.
- [03:43] So, when an action potential runs down to the end of an axon, it activates the chemical
- [03:48] messengers that jump that tiny synaptic gap, flying like that little air kiss and landing
- [03:53] on the receptor sites of the receiving neuron.
- [03:55] Those messengers are neurotransmitters.
- [03:58] Although neurotransmitters slide right into their intended receptors like a key into a
- [04:02] lock, they don't stay bonded to the receiving neuron.
- [04:05] They just sort of pop out, having excited or inhibited the receiving neuron's trigger,
- [04:09] then the extras immediately get reabsorbed by the neuron that released them in the first
- [04:13] place in a process called reuptake.
- [04:15] Kinda like, "Here you go, oh, psych!"
- [04:17] So neurons communicate with neurotransmitters which in turn cause motion and emotion; they
- [04:22] help us move around, make jazz hands, learn, feel, remember, stay alert, get sleepy, and
- [04:28] pretty much do everything we do.
- [04:30] Some of them just make you feel good, like the endorphins we get flooded with after running
- [04:34] ten miles or falling in love or eating a really good piece of pie.
- [04:37] We've got over 100 different kinds of these brilliant neurotransmitters -- some are excitatory
- [04:42] and others are inhibitory, and all are good reminders that everything psychological is
- [04:47] also biological.
- [04:49] Excitatory neurotransmitters rev up the neuron, increasing the chances it will fire off an
- [04:53] action potential.
- [04:54] Norepinephrine is one you're probably familiar with, it helps control alertness and arousal.
- [04:59] Glutamate is another, involved in memory, but an over-supply of it can wig out the brain
- [05:03] and cause seizures and migraines which is why some people are sensitive to all that
- [05:07] MSG, or monosodium glutamate, in their Ramen.
- [05:11] Inhibitory neurotransmitters on the other hand, chill neurons out, decreasing the likelihood
- [05:15] that the neuron will jump into action.
- [05:17] GABA– gamma-aminobutyric acid– is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter, and you've probably
- [05:22] heard of serotonin which affects your mood and hunger and sleep.
- [05:25] Low amounts of serotonin are linked to depression, and a certain class of antidepressants help
- [05:29] raise serotonin levels in the brain.
- [05:31] Some neurotransmitters like acetylcholine and dopamine play both sides and can both
- [05:35] excite or inhibit neurons depending on what type of receptors they encounter.
- [05:39] Acetylcholine enables muscle action and influences learning and memory; Alzheimer's patients
- [05:43] experience a deterioration of their acetylcholine producing neurons.
- [05:47] Dopamine, meanwhile, is associated with learning, movement, and pleasurable emotions, and excessive
- [05:51] amounts of it are linked to schizophrenia as well as addictive and impulsive behavior.
- [05:55] So neurotransmitters are basically your nervous system's couriers.
- [05:59] But they aren't the only chemical messengers delivering the news; they've got some competition
- [06:02] brewing in the endocrine system.

### Transcript (reading)

In the early 1800's, German physician, Franz Joseph Gall spent a lot of time running his fingers over the scalps of strangers. He wasn't a hairdresser, he wasn't a masseuse, he wasn't just like a big fan of heads. He was a phrenologist, he was the first phrenologist. Gall believed that a persons personality was linked to their skull morphology, that its bumps and ridges indicated aspects of their character. Amazingly this "science" actually caught on, was widely practiced for decades, and Gall became something of a celebrity. Well, with a head like his, one can see how he might have been a little bit fixated with skull shape. Eventually, phrenology was dismissed as a cult pseudoscience because it turns out your

cranial contours tell us exactly nothing about what's happening inside the brain. And yet! Gall was actually on to something big, something that we knew nothing about. Remember, at this point we were just starting to get consensus that the brain was the source of self and not like the soul or the heart or whatever. His lasting and correct proposition was that different parts of the brain control specific aspects of our behavior. Like we talked about last time, there is a strong link between biological activity and psychological events. But in addition to the interplay of chemicals like neurotransmitters and hormones, a lot of this has to do with that localized parts of the brain have specific functions, like vision, movement, memory, speech, and even facial recognition. Function,

in other words, is localized. If you could stimulate different parts of my brain in any way you wanted to– and if you ask me nicely, I just might let you– you could control my movements, my memories, and even my personality. Poke my brain over here and my arm would twitch, poke here and I'd remember my first kiss, do it up her and suddenly I'd be filled with a tremendous Hulk-like rage! This is the link between the brain, that physical hunk of gunk between the ears, and the mind, the thing that is us, our consciousness, our behavior, our decisions, our memories, our selves. Some neuroscientists like to say that the mind is what the brain does, so one of the driving questions of psychology and, like, the human experiment is "How do our brains'

functions tie to the behavior of the mind?" And you can't even ask the right questions, let alone get at some of the answers, until you get to know the brain. [Intro] You might have a passing familiarity with your nervous system, like, "The brain bone is connected to the spinal cord bone, and the spinal cord bone is connected to the motoneuron bone." That's your central nervous system, and there aren't actually any bones. Your central nervous system, or just CNS, is what makes your bodies big decisions. This system is the command center, and if you mess with it, things are gonna get weird. There's also the peripheral nervous system, which is composed of scout-like sensory neurons that gather information and report it back to the central nervous system.

To get a handle on just how physical the roots of your mind and personality are, how concretely your nervous system makes you you, let me tell you a story. The curious case of Phineas Gage. In 1848, a genial chap named Phineas Gage was working on the railroad, tamping gunpowder into a blasting hole with an iron rod, but the gunpowder ignited.The resulting explosion caused the rod to shoot like a bullet up through his left cheek and out of the top of his head. There's brain in between those two places, by the way. Amazingly, he stood up after the accident, and walked over to a cart, described what had happened, and then they drove him back to his house, all while he was conscious.

So the doctor came to examine him, and refused to believe that a rod had in fact passed through his head, understandably. Until Phineas started coughing and an amount of brain that the doctor described as a teacup-ful fell out of his head, and the doctor had to accept indeed what had happened. After a few months of convalescing, he was pretty much healed up and moving around like he used to. But his friends were saying that Phineas was no longer like himself. Yes he had his memories and his mental abilities, and he walked and talked and looked the same, minus an eyeball, whereas the old Phineas was mild-mannered and soft-spoken, the post-spike-to-the-brain Phineas was surly and mean-spirited and vulgar. People started to describe him as "no longer Gage."

Phineas moved away from America, the scientific establishment lost contact with him and 12 years later, after a series of seizures he died at the age of 36. Phineas is a great, if extreme, example of how function is localized in the brain and how physical and biological factors can be reflected in psychological ways. Of course he is also an excellent example of how individual studies are not particularly useful, especially since we have very little data on what Phineas was actually like before or even after his accident. Most accounts are from the months directly after the accident, and many of them conflict. It's completely possible that he continued to heal and lived his remaining years as a happy and productive citizen.

Intro-psychology texts often paint the simple picture of Phineas just so we can have a clear example of the moment when physicians realized that messing with the brain was messing with the mind, but it is of course all much more complicated and Phineas was an actual, real life person, I feel that we should give him the nuance and mystery that he deserves. Now you might have heard that we only used about 10 percent of our brains, and oh if that were true, Phineas would lose a quarter of his and he'd be just fine. And if we could just harness the rest of that gray mush, we'd be able to mind read and levitate and get all Professor X. It's an exciting thought, as exciting as the idea that I can tell what kind of tea you like by feeling the bumps on your head. It is also exactly as wrong.

After watching an hour or so of reality TV, you'd be forgiven for thinking that some people are only working at 10 percent brain capacity. But in actual reality, brain scans show that nearly every region of the brain lights up during even simple tasks like walking and talking. Not only that, but the brain itself requires 20 percent of all the body's energy, and it would make little evolutionary sense to throw much energy away at something that is only minimally active. As animals, our capabilities have developed in part from our brain structures. We're actually able to trace our evolutionary history as we come to understand these structures. Less complex animals have simpler brains designed for basic functioning and survival: rest,

breathe, eat. Whereas more complex animals like many mammals possess brains that feel, remember, reason, and predict. These animals don't have all new systems. They have new brain systems built upon old brain systems. The brain is kind of like a set of Russian nesting dolls. The outermost wooden doll is the newest, most detailed and most complex, but as you go deeper, the dolls become older and smaller, and simpler, and more generic. The innermost wooden doll is the oldest, most basic. It's like a fossil in your head. This inner core of the brain, sometimes called the "old brain" still performs for us much as it did for our early evolutionary ancestors. It's anchored by the brainstem, the most ancient

and central core of the brain where the spinal brain enters the skull. Above it, at the base of the skull, is the medulla. Here, old brain functions happen automatically without any conscious effort: the beating of hearts, the breathing of lungs, that sort of thing. The pons is perched on the medulla, and it helps coordinate movement. Above the pons, at the top of the brainstem, is the thalamus, a pair of egg-shaped structures that take in sensory information related to seeing, hearing, touching, and tasting. The reticular formation is a finger-shaped nerve network inside the brain stem that's essential for arousal, which isn't necessarily what you feel upon seeing a particularly nice-looking human, but instead refers to

things like sleeping and walking and pain perception; other important functions. The baseball-sized cerebellum, or "little brain", swells from the bottom of the brain stem and is responsible for non-verbal learning and memory, the perception of time, and modulating motions, it controls voluntary movement like your sweet dance moves, but it also gets impaired easily under the influence of alcohol, hence the term "tipsy". So the old brain systems keep our body's basic functions running smoothly; the sort of stuff any animal might need. This is pretty much where the brain stops for reptiles. For higher functions, we look to the limbic system. This includes the amygdala, hypothalamus, and hippocampus. Sort of a border region of the brain separating the old brain and the

newer, higher cerebral areas. The amygdala consists of two lima bean-sized clusters of neurons and is responsible for memory consolidation as well as both our greatest fear and hottest aggression. Stimulate one area of the amygdala, and a docile family dog suddenly morphs into a blood thirsty Cujo. Shift that electrode over just a tiny bit and that dog will be cowering at butterfly shadow puppets. The hypothalamus keeps your whole body steady, regulating body temperatures, circadian rhythms, and hunger, also helps govern the endocrine system, especially the pituitary gland. You should also thank your hypothalamus for allowing you to feel pleasure and reward. Rats implanted with electrodes in the reward center of their

hypothalamuses and given ways to self stimulate those areas will essentially reward themselves until they collapse or die. So, use with caution. The final part of the limbic system is the hippocampus, central to learning and memory, and if it's damaged, a person may lose their ability to retain new facts and memories. Now above all of this is the most advanced stuff - the stuff that you think of when you think of the brain - the grey matter. The two hemispheres of your cerebrum make up about eighty-five percent of your brain weight, and oversee your ability to think, speak, and perceive. The left and right hemispheres govern and regulate different functions, giving us a split brain, connected by a structure called the corpus callosum. So, for instance,

language production is controlled largely by the left hemisphere, while certain creative functions are controlled by the right. Though this has nothing to do with handedness or people having dominant sides of their brain being more analytical or creative or whatever - that's part of what we call pop psychology: a behavioral disorder in which journalists and arm chair psychologists use research showing beautiful, detailed, intimately connected complexities of your brain to sell newspapers or reinforce previously held beliefs. Yes, some tasks are distributed to one side, but the sides are deeply and constantly connected; a statement as general as "artistic people use their right brains" is as useless as saying "artistic people have particularly bumpy heads".

Finally, covering the left and right hemispheres, we have the cerebral cortex, a thin layer of over twenty billion interconnected neurons. But let's not forget the unsung heroes of your nervous system: the billions of non-neuron glial cells, which provide a spider web of support that surround, insulate, and nourish the cerebral neurons. You've probably seen enough brain diagrams to know that the cerebral cortex's left and right sides are subdivided into four lobes: the frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal, all separated by especially prominent folds, or fissures. Each lobe does indeed have its own set of duties, and would have made Franz Gall proud. The frontal lobes, just behind your forehead, are involved in speaking, planning, judging,

abstract thinking, and as the tale of Phineas Gage reminds us, aspects of personality. The parietal lobes receive and process your sense of touch and body position. At the back of your head, the occipital lobes receive information related to sight. And the temporal lobes just above your ears process sound, including speech comprehension. Remember that each hemisphere controls the opposite side of the body, so my left temporal lobe processes sounds heard through my right ear. And within these lobes there are still more regions that have specialized functions. Your motor cortex at the rear of your frontal lobes, for example, controls voluntary movements and sends messages from the brain out to the body like "pet that dog!" or "pick up that mug", while your somatosensory cortex right

behind it processes incoming sensations like "Oooooh, that doggie is soft!" or "Gah, the mug is hot!" The rest of your grey matter is made up of association areas that are related to higher mental functions like remembering, thinking, learning, and speaking. But the thing about association areas is that unlike your sensory or motor cortex, you couldn't just poke one and create a neat response. Association areas are more subtle; they deal with things like interpreting and integrating sensory input and linking up with memories. And they prevail throughout all four lobes, so brain damage to different areas will cause very different results. A lesion on a specific part of the temporal lobe may destroy a person's ability to recognize

faces; traumatic memories or overactive hormones can profoundly affect our behavior and emotions - all of which remind us how fundamentally biology and psychology are intertwined. And there are few more fascinating examples of this than how we sense and perceive the world around us, so that's where we're gonna pick up next week. For now, if you were paying attention, you learned the basics of the central nervous system, specifically the brain, which can be understood in terms of old or of more evolutionary ancestral structures, along with the limbic system, and new structures, which include lobes, cortices, and association areas.

### Transcript (navigation)

- [00:00] In the early 1800's, German physician, Franz Joseph Gall spent a lot of time running his
- [00:05] fingers over the scalps of strangers. He wasn't a hairdresser, he wasn't a masseuse, he wasn't
- [00:11] just like a big fan of heads. He was a phrenologist, he was the first phrenologist. Gall believed
- [00:16] that a persons personality was linked to their skull morphology, that its bumps and ridges
- [00:21] indicated aspects of their character. Amazingly this "science" actually caught on, was widely
- [00:26] practiced for decades, and Gall became something of a celebrity.
- [00:30] Well, with a head like his, one can see how he might have been a little bit fixated with
- [00:35] skull shape.
- [00:36] Eventually, phrenology was dismissed as a cult pseudoscience because it turns out your
- [00:40] cranial contours tell us exactly nothing about what's happening inside the brain.
- [00:44] And yet! Gall was actually on to something big, something that we knew nothing about.
- [00:48] Remember, at this point we were just starting to get consensus that the brain was the source
- [00:52] of self and not like the soul or the heart or whatever. His lasting and correct proposition
- [00:57] was that different parts of the brain control specific aspects of our behavior.
- [01:01] Like we talked about last time, there is a strong link between biological activity and
- [01:05] psychological events. But in addition to the interplay of chemicals like neurotransmitters
- [01:09] and hormones, a lot of this has to do with that localized parts of the brain have specific
- [01:14] functions, like vision, movement, memory, speech, and even facial recognition. Function,
- [01:19] in other words, is localized.
- [01:21] If you could stimulate different parts of my brain in any way you wanted to– and if
- [01:23] you ask me nicely, I just might let you– you could control my movements, my memories,
- [01:27] and even my personality. Poke my brain over here and my arm would twitch, poke here and
- [01:32] I'd remember my first kiss, do it up her and suddenly I'd be filled with a tremendous Hulk-like
- [01:36] rage!
- [01:37] This is the link between the brain, that physical hunk of gunk between the ears, and the mind,
- [01:42] the thing that is us, our consciousness, our behavior, our decisions, our memories, our
- [01:48] selves. Some neuroscientists like to say that the mind is what the brain does, so one of
- [01:53] the driving questions of psychology and, like, the human experiment is "How do our brains'
- [01:58] functions tie to the behavior of the mind?" And you can't even ask the right questions,
- [02:03] let alone get at some of the answers, until you get to know the brain.
- [02:09] [Intro]
- [02:12] You might have a passing familiarity with your nervous system, like, "The brain bone
- [02:19] is connected to the spinal cord bone, and the spinal cord bone is connected to the motoneuron
- [02:24] bone." That's your central nervous system, and there aren't actually any bones. Your
- [02:28] central nervous system, or just CNS, is what makes your bodies big decisions. This system
- [02:32] is the command center, and if you mess with it, things are gonna get weird. There's also
- [02:36] the peripheral nervous system, which is composed of scout-like sensory neurons that gather
- [02:40] information and report it back to the central nervous system.
- [02:43] To get a handle on just how physical the roots of your mind and personality are, how concretely
- [02:48] your nervous system makes you you, let me tell you a story. The curious case of Phineas
- [02:53] Gage. In 1848, a genial chap named Phineas Gage was working on the railroad, tamping
- [02:58] gunpowder into a blasting hole with an iron rod, but the gunpowder ignited.The resulting
- [03:03] explosion caused the rod to shoot like a bullet up through his left cheek and out of the top
- [03:08] of his head. There's brain in between those two places, by the way. Amazingly, he stood
- [03:13] up after the accident, and walked over to a cart, described what had happened, and then
- [03:17] they drove him back to his house, all while he was conscious.
- [03:20] So the doctor came to examine him, and refused to believe that a rod had in fact passed through
- [03:25] his head, understandably. Until Phineas started coughing and an amount of brain that the doctor
- [03:31] described as a teacup-ful fell out of his head, and the doctor had to accept indeed
- [03:37] what had happened. After a few months of convalescing, he was pretty much healed up and moving around
- [03:42] like he used to. But his friends were saying that Phineas was no longer like himself. Yes
- [03:47] he had his memories and his mental abilities, and he walked and talked and looked the same,
- [03:52] minus an eyeball, whereas the old Phineas was mild-mannered and soft-spoken, the post-spike-to-the-brain
- [03:58] Phineas was surly and mean-spirited and vulgar. People started to describe him as "no longer
- [04:03] Gage."
- [04:04] Phineas moved away from America, the scientific establishment lost contact with him and 12
- [04:08] years later, after a series of seizures he died at the age of 36. Phineas is a great,
- [04:13] if extreme, example of how function is localized in the brain and how physical and biological
- [04:17] factors can be reflected in psychological ways. Of course he is also an excellent example
- [04:22] of how individual studies are not particularly useful, especially since we have very little
- [04:26] data on what Phineas was actually like before or even after his accident. Most accounts
- [04:31] are from the months directly after the accident, and many of them conflict. It's completely
- [04:34] possible that he continued to heal and lived his remaining years as a happy and productive
- [04:38] citizen.
- [04:39] Intro-psychology texts often paint the simple picture of Phineas just so we can have a clear
- [04:43] example of the moment when physicians realized that messing with the brain was messing with
- [04:47] the mind, but it is of course all much more complicated and Phineas was an actual, real
- [04:51] life person, I feel that we should give him the nuance and mystery that he deserves.
- [04:55] Now you might have heard that we only used about 10 percent of our brains, and oh if
- [04:59] that were true, Phineas would lose a quarter of his and he'd be just fine. And if we could
- [05:03] just harness the rest of that gray mush, we'd be able to mind read and levitate and get
- [05:07] all Professor X. It's an exciting thought, as exciting as the idea that I can tell what
- [05:11] kind of tea you like by feeling the bumps on your head. It is also exactly as wrong.
- [05:15] After watching an hour or so of reality TV, you'd be forgiven for thinking that some people
- [05:19] are only working at 10 percent brain capacity. But in actual reality, brain scans show that
- [05:24] nearly every region of the brain lights up during even simple tasks like walking and
- [05:28] talking. Not only that, but the brain itself requires 20 percent of all the body's energy,
- [05:32] and it would make little evolutionary sense to throw much energy away at something that
- [05:36] is only minimally active.
- [05:37] As animals, our capabilities have developed in part from our brain structures. We're actually
- [05:42] able to trace our evolutionary history as we come to understand these structures. Less
- [05:46] complex animals have simpler brains designed for basic functioning and survival: rest,
- [05:51] breathe, eat. Whereas more complex animals like many mammals possess brains that feel,
- [05:55] remember, reason, and predict. These animals don't have all new systems. They have new
- [06:00] brain systems built upon old brain systems. The brain is kind of like a set of Russian
- [06:04] nesting dolls. The outermost wooden doll is the newest, most detailed and most complex,
- [06:09] but as you go deeper, the dolls become older and smaller, and simpler, and more generic.
- [06:13] The innermost wooden doll is the oldest, most basic. It's like a fossil in your head.
- [06:18] This inner core of the brain, sometimes called the "old brain" still performs for us much
- [06:22] as it did for our early evolutionary ancestors. It's anchored by the brainstem, the most ancient
- [06:27] and central core of the brain where the spinal brain enters the skull. Above it, at the base
- [06:32] of the skull, is the medulla. Here, old brain functions happen automatically without any
- [06:37] conscious effort: the beating of hearts, the breathing of lungs, that sort of thing. The
- [06:40] pons is perched on the medulla, and it helps coordinate movement. Above the pons, at the
- [06:45] top of the brainstem, is the thalamus, a pair of egg-shaped structures that take in sensory
- [06:50] information related to seeing, hearing, touching, and tasting. The reticular formation is a
- [06:54] finger-shaped nerve network inside the brain stem that's essential for arousal, which isn't
- [06:59] necessarily what you feel upon seeing a particularly nice-looking human, but instead refers to
- [07:03] things like sleeping and walking and pain perception; other important functions. The
- [07:07] baseball-sized cerebellum, or "little brain", swells from the bottom of the brain stem and
- [07:10] is responsible for non-verbal learning and memory, the perception of time, and modulating
- [07:15] motions, it controls voluntary movement like your sweet dance moves, but it also gets impaired
- [07:20] easily under the influence of alcohol, hence the term "tipsy".
- [07:23] So the old brain systems keep our body's basic functions running smoothly; the sort of stuff
- [07:27] any animal might need. This is pretty much where the brain stops for reptiles.
- [07:32] For higher functions, we look to the limbic system. This includes the amygdala, hypothalamus,
- [07:36] and hippocampus. Sort of a border region of the brain separating the old brain and the
- [07:40] newer, higher cerebral areas. The amygdala consists of two lima bean-sized clusters of
- [07:45] neurons and is responsible for memory consolidation as well as both our greatest fear and hottest
- [07:50] aggression. Stimulate one area of the amygdala, and a docile family dog suddenly morphs into
- [07:54] a blood thirsty Cujo. Shift that electrode over just a tiny bit and that dog will be
- [07:58] cowering at butterfly shadow puppets. The hypothalamus keeps your whole body steady,
- [08:03] regulating body temperatures, circadian rhythms, and hunger, also helps govern the endocrine
- [08:07] system, especially the pituitary gland. You should also thank your hypothalamus for allowing
- [08:10] you to feel pleasure and reward. Rats implanted with electrodes in the reward center of their
- [08:15] hypothalamuses and given ways to self stimulate those areas will essentially reward themselves
- [08:20] until they collapse or die. So, use with caution. The final part of the limbic system is the
- [08:25] hippocampus, central to learning and memory, and if it's damaged, a person may lose their
- [08:30] ability to retain new facts and memories.
- [08:32] Now above all of this is the most advanced stuff - the stuff that you think of when you
- [08:36] think of the brain - the grey matter. The two hemispheres of your cerebrum make up about
- [08:40] eighty-five percent of your brain weight, and oversee your ability to think, speak,
- [08:44] and perceive. The left and right hemispheres govern and regulate different functions, giving
- [08:48] us a split brain, connected by a structure called the corpus callosum. So, for instance,
- [08:53] language production is controlled largely by the left hemisphere, while certain creative
- [08:57] functions are controlled by the right. Though this has nothing to do with handedness or
- [09:01] people having dominant sides of their brain being more analytical or creative or whatever
- [09:06] - that's part of what we call pop psychology: a behavioral disorder in which journalists
- [09:10] and arm chair psychologists use research showing beautiful, detailed, intimately connected
- [09:15] complexities of your brain to sell newspapers or reinforce previously held beliefs.
- [09:20] Yes, some tasks are distributed to one side, but the sides are deeply and constantly connected;
- [09:24] a statement as general as "artistic people use their right brains" is as useless as saying
- [09:29] "artistic people have particularly bumpy heads".
- [09:32] Finally, covering the left and right hemispheres, we have the cerebral cortex, a thin layer
- [09:36] of over twenty billion interconnected neurons. But let's not forget the unsung heroes of
- [09:41] your nervous system: the billions of non-neuron glial cells, which provide a spider web of
- [09:45] support that surround, insulate, and nourish the cerebral neurons.
- [09:49] You've probably seen enough brain diagrams to know that the cerebral cortex's left and
- [09:53] right sides are subdivided into four lobes: the frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal,
- [09:58] all separated by especially prominent folds, or fissures. Each lobe does indeed have its
- [10:03] own set of duties, and would have made Franz Gall proud.
- [10:06] The frontal lobes, just behind your forehead, are involved in speaking, planning, judging,
- [10:10] abstract thinking, and as the tale of Phineas Gage reminds us, aspects of personality. The
- [10:14] parietal lobes receive and process your sense of touch and body position. At the back of
- [10:19] your head, the occipital lobes receive information related to sight. And the temporal lobes just
- [10:23] above your ears process sound, including speech comprehension.
- [10:26] Remember that each hemisphere controls the opposite side of the body, so my left temporal
- [10:30] lobe processes sounds heard through my right ear. And within these lobes there are still
- [10:34] more regions that have specialized functions. Your motor cortex at the rear of your frontal
- [10:38] lobes, for example, controls voluntary movements and sends messages from the brain out to the
- [10:42] body like "pet that dog!" or "pick up that mug", while your somatosensory cortex right
- [10:46] behind it processes incoming sensations like "Oooooh, that doggie is soft!" or "Gah, the
- [10:50] mug is hot!"
- [10:51] The rest of your grey matter is made up of association areas that are related to higher
- [10:55] mental functions like remembering, thinking, learning, and speaking. But the thing about
- [10:59] association areas is that unlike your sensory or motor cortex, you couldn't just poke one
- [11:04] and create a neat response. Association areas are more subtle; they deal with things like
- [11:08] interpreting and integrating sensory input and linking up with memories. And they prevail
- [11:12] throughout all four lobes, so brain damage to different areas will cause very different
- [11:17] results.
- [11:17] A lesion on a specific part of the temporal lobe may destroy a person's ability to recognize
- [11:22] faces; traumatic memories or overactive hormones can profoundly affect our behavior and emotions
- [11:28] - all of which remind us how fundamentally biology and psychology are intertwined. And

### Transcript (reading)

Let me tell you about Oliver Sacks, the famous physician, professor and author of unusual neurological case studies. We’ll be looking at some of his fascinating research in future lessons, but for now, I just want to talk about Sacks himself. Although he possesses a brilliant and inquisitive mind, Dr. Sacks cannot do a simple thing that your average toddler can. He can’t recognize his own face in the mirror. Sacks has a form of prosopagnosia, a neurological disorder that impairs a person’s ability to perceive or recognize faces, also known as face blindness. Last week we talked about how brain function is localized, and this is another peculiarly excellent example of that.

Sacks can recognize his coffee cup on the shelf, but he can’t pick out his oldest friend from a crowd, because the specific sliver of his brain responsible for facial recognition is malfunctioning. There’s nothing wrong with his vision. The sense is intact. The problem is with his perception, at least when it comes to recognizing faces. Prosopagnosia is a good example of how sensing and perceiving are connected, but different. Sensation is the bottom-up process by which our senses, like vision, hearing and smell, receive and relay outside stimuli. Perception, on the other hand, is the top-down way our brains organize and interpret that information and put it into context.

So right now at this very moment, you’re probably receiving light from your screen through your eyes, which will send the data of that sensation to your brain. Perception meanwhile is your brain telling you that what you’re seeing is a diagram explaining the difference between sensation and perception, which is pretty meta. Now your brain is interpreting that light as a talking person, whom your brain might additionally recognize as Hank. [Intro] We are constantly bombarded by stimuli even though we’re only aware of what our own senses can pick up. Like I can see and hear and feel and even smell this Corgi, but I can’t hunt using sonar like a bat or hear a mole tunneling underground like an owl or see ultraviolet and infrared light like a mantis shrimp.

I probably can’t even smell half of what you can smell. No! No! We have different senses. Mwah mwah mwah mwah mwah. Yeah. There’s a lot to sense in the world, and not everybody needs to sense all the same stuff. So every animal has its limitations which we can talk about more precisely if we define the Absolute Threshold of Sensation, the minimum stimulation needed to register a particular stimulus, 50% of the time. So if I play a tiny little beep in your ear and you tell me that you hear it fifty percent of the times that I play it, that’s your absolute threshold of sensation. We have to use a percentage because sometimes I'll play the beep and you’ll hear it and sometimes you won’t even though it’s the exact same volume.

Why? Because brains are complicated. Detecting a weak sensory signal like that beep in daily life isn’t only about the strength of the stimulus. It’s also about your psychological state; your alertness and expectations in the moment. This has to do with Signal Detection Theory, a model for predicting how and when a person will detect a weak stimuli, partly based on context. Exhausted new parents might hear their baby’s tiniest whimper, but not even register the bellow of a passing train. Their paranoid parent brains are so trained on their baby, it gives their senses a sort of boosted ability, but only in relation to the subject of their attention. Conversely, if you’re experiencing constant stimulation, your senses will adjust in a process called sensory adaptation.

It is the reason that I have to check and see if my wallet is there if it’s in my right pocket, but if I move it to my left pocket, it feels like a big uncomfortable lump. It’s also useful to be able to talk about our ability to detect the difference between two stimuli. I might go out at night and look up at the sky and, well, I know with my objective science brain that no two stars have the exact same brightness, and yeah, I can tell with my eyeballs that some stars are brighter than others, but other stars just look exactly the same to me. I can’t tell the difference in their brightness. Are you done? Is it time for your to go? Gimme, gimme a kiiiissss. Yes, yes. Okay.

Good girl. The point at which one can tell the difference is the difference threshold, but it’s not linear. Like. if a tiny star is just a tiny bit brighter than another tiny star, I can tell. But if a big star is that same tiny amount brighter than another big star, I won’t be able to tell the difference. This is important enough that we gave the guy who discovered it a law. Weber’s Law says that we perceive differences on a logarithmic, not a linear scale. It’s not the amount of change. It’s the percentage change that matters. Alright. How about now we take a more in depth look at how one of our most powerful senses works? Vision. Your ability to see your face in the mirror is the result of a long but lightning quick sequence of events.

Light bounces off your face and then off the mirror and then into your eyes, which take in all that varied energy and transforms it into neural messages that your brain processes and organizes into what you actually see, which is your face. Or if you’re looking elsewhere, you could see a coffee cup or a Corgi or a scary clown holding a tiny cream pie. So how do we transform light waves into meaningful information? Well, let’s start with the light itself. What we humans see as light is only a small fraction of the full spectrum of electromagnetic radiation that ranges from gamma to radio waves. Now light has all kinds of fascinating characteristics that determine how we sense it, but for the purposes of this topic, we’ll understand light as traveling in waves.

The wave’s wavelength and frequency determines their hue, and their amplitude determines their intensity or brightness. For instance a short wave has a high frequency. Our eyes register short wavelengths with high frequencies as blueish colors while we see long, low frequency wavelengths as reddish hues. The way we register the brightness of a color, the contrast between the orange of a sherbet and the orange of a construction cone has to do with the intensity or amount of energy in a given light wave. Which as we’ve just said is determined by its amplitude. Greater amplitude means higher intensity, means brighter color. Someone’s just told me that sherbet doesn’t- isn’t a word that exists.

His name is Michael Aranda and he’s a dumbhead. Did you type it into the dictionary? Type it into Google. Ask Google about sherbet. So sherbet is a thing. So after taking this light in through the cornea and the pupil, it hits the transparent disc behind the pupil: the lens, which focuses the light rays into specific images, and just as you’d expect the lens to do, it projects these images onto the retina, the inner surface of the eyeball that contains all the receptor cells that begin sensing that visual information. Now your retinas don’t receive a full image like a movie being projected onto a screen. It’s more like a bunch of pixel points of light energy that millions of receptors translate into neural impulses and zip back into the brain.

These retinal receptors are called rods and cones. Our rods detect gray scale and are used in our peripheral vision as well as to avoid stubbing our toes in twilight conditions when we can’t really see in color. Our cones detect fine detail and color. Concentrated near the retina’s central focal point called the fovea, cones function only in well lit conditions, allowing you to appreciate the intricacies of your grandma’s china pattern or your uncle’s sleeve tattoo. And the human eye is terrific at seeing color. Our difference threshold for colors is so exceptional that the average person can distinguish a million different hues. There’s a good deal of ongoing research around exactly how our color vision works.

But two theories help us explain some of what we know. One model, called the Young-Helmholtz trichromatic theory suggests that the retina houses three specific color receptor cones that register red, green and blue, and when stimulated together, their combined power allows the eye to register any color. Unless, of course you’re colorblind. About one in fifty people have some level of color vision deficiency. They’re mostly dudes because the genetic defect is sex linked. If you can’t see the Crash Course logo pop out at you in this figure, it’s likely that your red or green cones are missing or malfunctioning which means you have dichromatic instead of trichromatic vision and can’t distinguish between shades of red and green.

The other model for color vision, known as the opponent-process theory, suggests that we see color through processes that actually work against each other. So some receptor cells might be stimulated by red but inhibited by green, while others do the opposite, and those combinations allow us to register colors. But back to your eyeballs. When stimulated, the rods and cones trigger chemical changes that spark neural signals which in turn activate the cells behind them called bipolar cells, whose job it is to turn on the neighboring ganglion cells. The long axon tails of these ganglions braid together to form the ropy optic nerve, which is what carries the neural impulses from the eyeball to the brain.

That visual information then slips through a chain of progressively complex levels as it travels from optic nerve, to the thalamus, and on to the brain’s visual cortex. The visual cortex sits at the back of the brain in the occipital lobe, where the right cortex processes input from the left eye and vice versa. This cortex has specialized nerve cells, called feature detectors that respond to specific features like shapes, angles and movements. In other words different parts of your visual cortex are responsible for identifying different aspects of things. A person who can’t recognize human faces may have no trouble picking out their set of keys from a pile on the counter.

That’s because the brains object perception occurs in a different place from its face perception. In the case of Dr. Sacks, his condition affects the region of the brain called the fusiform gyrus, which activates in response to seeing faces. Sacks’s face blindness is congenital, but it may also be acquired through disease or injury to that same region of the brain. And some cells in a region may respond to just one type of stimulus, like posture or movement or facial expression, while other clusters of cells weave all that separate information together in an instant analysis of a situation. That clown is frowning and running at me with a tiny cream pie. I’m putting these factors together.

Maybe I should get out of here. This ability to process and analyze many separate aspects of the situation at once is called parallel processing. In the case of visual processing, this means that the brain simultaneously works on making sense of form, depth, motion and color and this is where we enter the whole world of perception which gets complicated quickly, and can even get downright philosophical. So we’ll be exploring that in depth next time but for now, if you were paying attention, you learned the difference between sensation and perception, the different thresholds that limit our senses, and some of the neurology and biology and psychology of human vision.

- [00:00] Let me tell you about Oliver Sacks, the famous physician, professor and author of unusual
- [00:05] neurological case studies.
- [00:07] We’ll be looking at some of his fascinating research in future lessons, but for now, I
- [00:10] just want to talk about Sacks himself.
- [00:12] Although he possesses a brilliant and inquisitive mind, Dr. Sacks cannot do a simple thing that
- [00:17] your average toddler can.
- [00:19] He can’t recognize his own face in the mirror.
- [00:22] Sacks has a form of prosopagnosia, a neurological disorder that impairs a person’s ability
- [00:27] to perceive or recognize faces, also known as face blindness.
- [00:31] Last week we talked about how brain function is localized, and this is another peculiarly
- [00:35] excellent example of that.
- [00:37] Sacks can recognize his coffee cup on the shelf, but he can’t pick out his oldest
- [00:42] friend from a crowd, because the specific sliver of his brain responsible for facial
- [00:46] recognition is malfunctioning.
- [00:47] There’s nothing wrong with his vision.
- [00:49] The sense is intact.
- [00:50] The problem is with his perception, at least when it comes to recognizing faces.
- [00:54] Prosopagnosia is a good example of how sensing and perceiving are connected, but different.
- [00:59] Sensation is the bottom-up process by which our senses, like vision, hearing and smell,
- [01:04] receive and relay outside stimuli.
- [01:06] Perception, on the other hand, is the top-down way our brains organize and interpret that
- [01:11] information and put it into context.
- [01:13] So right now at this very moment, you’re probably receiving light from your screen
- [01:17] through your eyes, which will send the data of that sensation to your brain.
- [01:21] Perception meanwhile is your brain telling you that what you’re seeing is a diagram
- [01:24] explaining the difference between sensation and perception, which is pretty meta.
- [01:28] Now your brain is interpreting that light as a talking person, whom your brain might
- [01:32] additionally recognize as Hank.
- [01:39] [Intro]
- [01:44] We are constantly bombarded by stimuli even though we’re only aware of what our own
- [01:48] senses can pick up.
- [01:49] Like I can see and hear and feel and even smell this Corgi, but I can’t hunt using
- [01:54] sonar like a bat or hear a mole tunneling underground like an owl or see ultraviolet
- [01:59] and infrared light like a mantis shrimp.
- [02:02] I probably can’t even smell half of what you can smell.
- [02:05] No!
- [02:06] No!
- [02:07] We have different senses.
- [02:08] Mwah mwah mwah mwah mwah.
- [02:10] Yeah.
- [02:11] There’s a lot to sense in the world, and not everybody needs to sense all the same
- [02:15] stuff.
- [02:16] So every animal has its limitations which we can talk about more precisely if we define
- [02:20] the Absolute Threshold of Sensation, the minimum stimulation needed to register a particular
- [02:25] stimulus, 50% of the time.
- [02:27] So if I play a tiny little beep in your ear and you tell me that you hear it fifty percent
- [02:30] of the times that I play it, that’s your absolute threshold of sensation.
- [02:34] We have to use a percentage because sometimes I'll play the beep and you’ll hear it and
- [02:38] sometimes you won’t even though it’s the exact same volume.
- [02:40] Why?
- [02:41] Because brains are complicated.
- [02:43] Detecting a weak sensory signal like that beep in daily life isn’t only about the
- [02:46] strength of the stimulus.
- [02:48] It’s also about your psychological state; your alertness and expectations in the moment.
- [02:53] This has to do with Signal Detection Theory, a model for predicting how and when a person
- [02:58] will detect a weak stimuli, partly based on context.
- [03:01] Exhausted new parents might hear their baby’s tiniest whimper, but not even register the
- [03:06] bellow of a passing train.
- [03:08] Their paranoid parent brains are so trained on their baby, it gives their senses a sort
- [03:12] of boosted ability, but only in relation to the subject of their attention.
- [03:16] Conversely, if you’re experiencing constant stimulation, your senses will adjust in a
- [03:20] process called sensory adaptation.
- [03:22] It is the reason that I have to check and see if my wallet is there if it’s in my
- [03:26] right pocket, but if I move it to my left pocket, it feels like a big uncomfortable
- [03:29] lump.
- [03:30] It’s also useful to be able to talk about our ability to detect the difference between
- [03:33] two stimuli.
- [03:34] I might go out at night and look up at the sky and, well, I know with my objective science
- [03:38] brain that no two stars have the exact same brightness, and yeah, I can tell with my eyeballs
- [03:43] that some stars are brighter than others, but other stars just look exactly the same
- [03:49] to me.
- [03:50] I can’t tell the difference in their brightness.
- [03:51] Are you done?
- [03:52] Is it time for your to go?
- [03:53] Gimme, gimme a kiiiissss.
- [03:55] Yes, yes.
- [03:56] Okay.
- [03:57] Good girl.
- [03:58] The point at which one can tell the difference is the difference threshold, but it’s not
- [04:02] linear.
- [04:03] Like.
- [04:04] if a tiny star is just a tiny bit brighter than another tiny star, I can tell.
- [04:07] But if a big star is that same tiny amount brighter than another big star, I won’t
- [04:11] be able to tell the difference.
- [04:12] This is important enough that we gave the guy who discovered it a law.
- [04:15] Weber’s Law says that we perceive differences on a logarithmic, not a linear scale.
- [04:20] It’s not the amount of change.
- [04:22] It’s the percentage change that matters.
- [04:24] Alright.
- [04:25] How about now we take a more in depth look at how one of our most powerful senses works?
- [04:30] Vision.
- [04:31] Your ability to see your face in the mirror is the result of a long but lightning quick
- [04:35] sequence of events.
- [04:37] Light bounces off your face and then off the mirror and then into your eyes, which take
- [04:41] in all that varied energy and transforms it into neural messages that your brain processes
- [04:46] and organizes into what you actually see, which is your face.
- [04:50] Or if you’re looking elsewhere, you could see a coffee cup or a Corgi or a scary clown
- [04:53] holding a tiny cream pie.
- [04:55] So how do we transform light waves into meaningful information?
- [04:57] Well, let’s start with the light itself.
- [04:59] What we humans see as light is only a small fraction of the full spectrum of electromagnetic
- [05:04] radiation that ranges from gamma to radio waves.
- [05:07] Now light has all kinds of fascinating characteristics that determine how we sense it, but for the
- [05:11] purposes of this topic, we’ll understand light as traveling in waves.
- [05:15] The wave’s wavelength and frequency determines their hue, and their amplitude determines
- [05:20] their intensity or brightness.
- [05:21] For instance a short wave has a high frequency.
- [05:24] Our eyes register short wavelengths with high frequencies as blueish colors while we see
- [05:29] long, low frequency wavelengths as reddish hues.
- [05:31] The way we register the brightness of a color, the contrast between the orange of a sherbet
- [05:35] and the orange of a construction cone has to do with the intensity or amount of energy
- [05:40] in a given light wave.
- [05:41] Which as we’ve just said is determined by its amplitude.
- [05:44] Greater amplitude means higher intensity, means brighter color.
- [05:48] Someone’s just told me that sherbet doesn’t- isn’t a word that exists.
- [05:52] His name is Michael Aranda and he’s a dumbhead.
- [05:55] Did you type it into the dictionary?
- [05:57] Type it into Google.
- [05:59] Ask Google about sherbet.
- [06:01] So sherbet is a thing.
- [06:02] So after taking this light in through the cornea and the pupil, it hits the transparent
- [06:06] disc behind the pupil: the lens, which focuses the light rays into specific images, and just
- [06:12] as you’d expect the lens to do, it projects these images onto the retina, the inner surface
- [06:16] of the eyeball that contains all the receptor cells that begin sensing that visual information.
- [06:20] Now your retinas don’t receive a full image like a movie being projected onto a screen.
- [06:24] It’s more like a bunch of pixel points of light energy that millions of receptors translate
- [06:29] into neural impulses and zip back into the brain.
- [06:32] These retinal receptors are called rods and cones.
- [06:35] Our rods detect gray scale and are used in our peripheral vision as well as to avoid
- [06:39] stubbing our toes in twilight conditions when we can’t really see in color.
- [06:42] Our cones detect fine detail and color.
- [06:45] Concentrated near the retina’s central focal point called the fovea, cones function only
- [06:49] in well lit conditions, allowing you to appreciate the intricacies of your grandma’s china
- [06:54] pattern or your uncle’s sleeve tattoo.
- [06:56] And the human eye is terrific at seeing color.
- [07:00] Our difference threshold for colors is so exceptional that the average person can distinguish
- [07:04] a million different hues.
- [07:06] There’s a good deal of ongoing research around exactly how our color vision works.
- [07:10] But two theories help us explain some of what we know.
- [07:12] One model, called the Young-Helmholtz trichromatic theory suggests that the retina houses three
- [07:17] specific color receptor cones that register red, green and blue, and when stimulated together,
- [07:22] their combined power allows the eye to register any color.
- [07:25] Unless, of course you’re colorblind.
- [07:27] About one in fifty people have some level of color vision deficiency.
- [07:30] They’re mostly dudes because the genetic defect is sex linked.
- [07:33] If you can’t see the Crash Course logo pop out at you in this figure, it’s likely that
- [07:36] your red or green cones are missing or malfunctioning which means you have dichromatic instead of
- [07:41] trichromatic vision and can’t distinguish between shades of red and green.
- [07:45] The other model for color vision, known as the opponent-process theory, suggests that
- [07:49] we see color through processes that actually work against each other.
- [07:52] So some receptor cells might be stimulated by red but inhibited by green, while others
- [07:57] do the opposite, and those combinations allow us to register colors.
- [08:01] But back to your eyeballs.
- [08:02] When stimulated, the rods and cones trigger chemical changes that spark neural signals
- [08:06] which in turn activate the cells behind them called bipolar cells, whose job it is to turn
- [08:11] on the neighboring ganglion cells.
- [08:14] The long axon tails of these ganglions braid together to form the ropy optic nerve, which
- [08:19] is what carries the neural impulses from the eyeball to the brain.
- [08:22] That visual information then slips through a chain of progressively complex levels as
- [08:26] it travels from optic nerve, to the thalamus, and on to the brain’s visual cortex.
- [08:30] The visual cortex sits at the back of the brain in the occipital lobe, where the right
- [08:34] cortex processes input from the left eye and vice versa.
- [08:38] This cortex has specialized nerve cells, called feature detectors that respond to specific
- [08:43] features like shapes, angles and movements.
- [08:45] In other words different parts of your visual cortex are responsible for identifying different
- [08:50] aspects of things.
- [08:51] A person who can’t recognize human faces may have no trouble picking out their set
- [08:55] of keys from a pile on the counter.
- [08:56] That’s because the brains object perception occurs in a different place from its face
- [09:00] perception.
- [09:01] In the case of Dr. Sacks, his condition affects the region of the brain called the fusiform
- [09:04] gyrus, which activates in response to seeing faces.
- [09:07] Sacks’s face blindness is congenital, but it may also be acquired through disease or
- [09:11] injury to that same region of the brain.
- [09:13] And some cells in a region may respond to just one type of stimulus, like posture or
- [09:17] movement or facial expression, while other clusters of cells weave all that separate
- [09:21] information together in an instant analysis of a situation.
- [09:24] That clown is frowning and running at me with a tiny cream pie.
- [09:28] I’m putting these factors together.
- [09:30] Maybe I should get out of here.
- [09:31] This ability to process and analyze many separate aspects of the situation at once is called
- [09:35] parallel processing.
- [09:36] In the case of visual processing, this means that the brain simultaneously works on making
- [09:40] sense of form, depth, motion and color and this is where we enter the whole world of
- [09:45] perception which gets complicated quickly, and can even get downright philosophical.
- [09:50] So we’ll be exploring that in depth next time but for now, if you were paying attention,
- [09:55] you learned the difference between sensation and perception, the different thresholds that
- [09:58] limit our senses, and some of the neurology and biology and psychology of human vision.

Homunculus! If you've heard that word, it probably wasn't in the context of psychology. A monster in Dungeons and Dragons, a song by They Might Be Giants, the bad guys in Fullmetal Alchemist, a novel by James Blaylock. It's Latin for 'little man' and in psychology, it refers to a kind of sensory map of the human body, a depiction of what we'd look like if each of our parts grew in proportion to how much we sense with them. Witness! Look at this dude. His ham hands could rip off a car door. I mean, if he could lift them, which he couldn't. Is this what we're supposed to look like on the inside? This freaky thing illustrates the weighted significance of our sensory receptors.

His disproportional hands are monstrous, for example, because we primarily touch the world with our hands, not our elbows, so our hands are extremely sensitive. His mouth, meanwhile, is huge because we also have a ton of sensory receptors in our tongues and lips. It's what we use for tasting food and for sucking face. As we continue our exploration of how we both sense and perceive the world, the Homunculus, while kind of freaky, is actually a pretty attractive model for understanding how our bodies interact with the environment. How we smell it with our outsized nose, taste it with our ridiculous Mick Jagger lips, and touch it with our enormous Donkey Kong hands. So join me, as we get to know the hideous little creature within you.

[Intro] Last week we talked about the difference between sensation and perception: how sensation is the process by which our senses and brain receive information from the outer world, while perception is how we organize and interpret that information and give it meaning. Like, right now, my sense of hearing is letting me detect sounds, while my brain is processing and interpreting them, allowing me to identify and perceive the individual sounds and determine if they're coming from the radio, or outside or right behind me. Sound moves in waves that vibrate through a medium, like air. And although they function differently that waves of electromagnetic radiation, including what we think of as light, sound waves also can vary in shape.

Short waves have a high frequency and a high pitch, like a plucky violin. Long waves have a low frequency and pitch, like a mournful cello. Wave height, or amplitude, determine a sound's loudness, which we typically measure in decibels. And just as light waves become electrical impulses that we register with our sight, so too do our ears turn vibrating air into signals that our brains can decipher. While the human ear might not be as elegant as the jackrabbit's, or as wild as the long-eared bat's, it's actually a pretty incredible organ. Or, organs, since we have two of them, which helps give us directional stereophonic hearing. That's the 3D type of hearing we couldn't experience if we had just one big, freaky ear in the middle of our foreheads.

Your outer ear, the part that you can see and pierce and tug on, collects sound waves and funnels through the ear canal and into the middle ear, where they cause your eardrum to vibrate. From there, sound vibrations are amplified by the so-called 'ossicle bones', which also happen to be the most awesomely named bones in your body: the stirrup, the hammer and the anvil. From here, those physical vibrations travel to the inner ear, where they bump into the snail-shaped cochlea, and its surrounding fluids get jostled around, causing some of your 16,000 tiny cochlear hair cells to bend. This motion triggers neighbouring nerve cells that convert that physical energy into electrical impulses zipping up the auditory nerve into the auditory cortex, where the brain is like

'Oh, songbirds!', or 'Elvis!', or 'Vengeance!', or whatever. And you know what goes great with a little bit of rockabilly, or revenge? A nice meal. One of the greatest joys in life is enjoying flavors; whether you prefer casserole or caviar, we all get our tasting done in the same way, starting with our taste buds. Each of our thousands of taste buds contains a sort of pocket-like pore that contains fifty to a hundred hair-like taste receptor cells that read food molecules and report back to the brain. "That chip is salty, that lemon is sour." Now, everybody used to think that our tongues just detected four distinct tastes: sweet, salty, sour and bitter. And you've probably seen the version of this bogus taste map, which incorrectly assigns certain tastes to certain parts of your tongue.

But we now recognize a fifth flavour: the savoury, meaty, MSG-y taste, for which there is no English word, it's known as 'umami'. But taste is nothing without smell. Plug your nose, and a bite of cold bacon is just a mouthful of salt. This is a prime example of sensory interaction; the principle that one sense can influence another. I'll get back to smell in just a bit, but I want to take a moment to talk about what happens when those sensory interactions get messy. Let us take a little questionnaire, shall we? Do certain words trigger a strong, specific taste in your mouth? Like, does the word 'kitten' taste like candy canes? Has hearing a sound ever made you see a color?

Like does Prince's voice singing Purple Rain actually cause the colour purple to flash before your eyes? Do you ever feel like you're being touched when you smell something? Like does the smell of lilies give you the sensation of touching a cold, metal surface? Most of you said no to all of those questions, but at least one of you out there answered yes. And more likely than not, that person has synesthesia, a rare and fascinating neurological condition where two or more senses get wrapped together. This kind of sensory mix up is involuntary, and it's experienced without forethought in a durable and consistent way. Like, the number seven is always going to taste like coffee, and it's never going to switch to tomato juice.

And we're still not sure what causes this phenomenon. One idea suggests that the rogue development of new neural connections may override normal boundaries that typically separate the senses. Another theory suggests that all babies are born with synesthesia and experience mixed sense until the brain matures and creates separate sense channels, unless they don't, in which case you grow up to be a synesthete. Yet another theory links the condition to wonky neurochemistry, in which the neurotransmitters associated with one function turn up way over in a different part of the brain. Just another example of how the mind is still extremely mysterious. So, back to the comparatively boring topic of smells that only smell...

unlike our wave detecting senses of sight and hearing, out taste and smell are chemical senses. We differentiate the smells of spring lilacs, grilled cheese, and gasoline when airborne molecules travel up the nose and reach the five to ten million receptor cells at the top of each nasal cavity; and yes, that means when you smell poop, there's poop particles in your nose. These receptors send information to the brain's olfactory bulb, then zips it on to the primary smell cortex and parts of the limbic system responsible for emotion and memory. Unlike our five different taste receptors or two types of retinal receptors, we don't have specifically differentiated smell receptors, rather, odour receptors come together in different combinations.

So, just like pressing different keys on your keyboard can allow you to form tons of different words, so too can these distinct combinations of activated smell receptors communicate some ten thousand unique smells. But, how we feel about a smell, and our perception of it, is often tangled up in our experiences with that scent. If our beloved grandma baked gingerbread every time we visited, those memories may make you partial to the smell of gingerbread. Even if we can't immediately name the odor, our brains are amazing at storing and recognizing old scents by their associations. Which is why you may suddenly feel happy when you walk into a bakery, even before you realize you're thinking of your grandma.

The emotional power of smell partly has to with how our sense circuitry connects to the brain's limbic system, right next to our emotional registry, the amygdala, and our memory keeper, the hippocampus. That's why scents can be so intimately tied with our feelings and memories. And how a whiff of Nag Champa can immediately transport to back to eating chips in your freshman dorm room. Smelling, hearing, tasting, seeing: all fantastic, but if there's one thing that popular music taught us, besides a bunch of really terrible relationship advice, it's that when it comes to our senses, we're all about touching. We've got songs about magic touches and golden touches, invisible and human touches.

Songs about touching ourselves, touching me, touching you, and even what you can't touch. Touch is extremely important, especially during early development. Baby monkeys that are allowed to see, hear and smell, but not touch their mamas become extremely distraught. That's just a mean experiment. Premature human babies gain weight faster if they're held and massaged, and some studies indicated that children that didn't receive enough physical attention as infants are at higher risk for emotional, behavioral, and social problems as they grow. Your sense of touch is actually a combination of four distinct skin sensations: pressure, warmth, cold, and pain. If you touch various spots of your skin with something soft like this anglerfish, you'll

feel that you sense different amounts of softness on different parts of your body... just put that up there... The same goes for a warm mug, or an ice cube, or a needle point. You'll sense that some spots are more or less sensitive to each of the four distinct sensations. Other skin sensations, like tickles, itches, and the experience of wetness, are just variations on those four different sensations. Ultimately, your sense of touch joins forces with sensors in your bones, joints, and tendons to provide your personal kinesthesis: the way that body senses its own movement and positioning. You use your kinesthetic sense whenever you walk, dance, swim, or hula hoop. It's what the cops are testing drunk people for when they ask them to touch their noses with their eyes closed.

This sense allows you to detect changes in the position of your body without relying on other senses, which is why you can still cha-cha, backstroke, and hula hoop with your eyes closed and your ears plugged. The partner sense to your kinesthesis is your vestibular sense, which monitors your head's position and your balance. This sense of equilibrium is ruled by the pretzel-shaped, semicircular canals and the fluid-filled vestibular sacs that connect those canals to the cochlea in your inner ear. So, if you spin around a bunch and suddenly stop, it'll take a minute for that inner ear fluid to return to normal, which is what makes you feel dizzy. That moving fluid is actually fooling your brain into thinking your body is still spinning.

It's a good example of how even our normal functioning senses can fool us. Understanding exactly how we get fooled helps us understand how our sensual perception system works, which is exactly what we're going to be talking about next time. For now, hopefully you realized that your homunculus is actually kinda beautiful, in its own way, because you learned how your sense of hearing, taste, smell, and touch work.

- [02:04] Long waves have a low frequency and pitch, like a mournful cello.
- [02:07] Wave height, or amplitude, determine a sound's loudness, which we typically measure in decibels.
- [02:12] And just as light waves become electrical impulses that we register with our sight,
- [02:16] so too do our ears turn vibrating air into signals that our brains can decipher.
- [02:21] While the human ear might not be as elegant as the jackrabbit's, or as wild as the long-eared
- [02:25] bat's, it's actually a pretty incredible organ.
- [02:27] Or, organs, since we have two of them, which helps give us directional stereophonic hearing.
- [02:32] That's the 3D type of hearing we couldn't experience if we had just one big, freaky
- [02:36] ear in the middle of our foreheads.
- [02:38] Your outer ear, the part that you can see and pierce and tug on, collects sound waves
- [02:42] and funnels through the ear canal and into the middle ear, where they cause your eardrum
- [02:47] to vibrate.
- [02:48] From there, sound vibrations are amplified by the so-called 'ossicle bones', which also
- [02:52] happen to be the most awesomely named bones in your body: the stirrup, the hammer and
- [02:56] the anvil.
- [02:57] From here, those physical vibrations travel to the inner ear, where they bump into the
- [03:01] snail-shaped cochlea, and its surrounding fluids get jostled around, causing some of
- [03:05] your 16,000 tiny cochlear hair cells to bend.
- [03:09] This motion triggers neighbouring nerve cells that convert that physical energy into electrical
- [03:13] impulses zipping up the auditory nerve into the auditory cortex, where the brain is like
- [03:17] 'Oh, songbirds!', or 'Elvis!', or 'Vengeance!', or whatever.
- [03:21] And you know what goes great with a little bit of rockabilly, or revenge?
- [03:25] A nice meal.
- [03:26] One of the greatest joys in life is enjoying flavors; whether you prefer casserole or caviar,
- [03:31] we all get our tasting done in the same way, starting with our taste buds.
- [03:34] Each of our thousands of taste buds contains a sort of pocket-like pore that contains fifty
- [03:38] to a hundred hair-like taste receptor cells that read food molecules and report back to
- [03:43] the brain.
- [03:44] "That chip is salty, that lemon is sour."
- [03:47] Now, everybody used to think that our tongues just detected four distinct tastes: sweet,
- [03:51] salty, sour and bitter.
- [03:52] And you've probably seen the version of this bogus taste map, which incorrectly assigns
- [03:56] certain tastes to certain parts of your tongue.
- [03:59] But we now recognize a fifth flavour: the savoury, meaty, MSG-y taste, for which there
- [04:04] is no English word, it's known as 'umami'.
- [04:07] But taste is nothing without smell.
- [04:09] Plug your nose, and a bite of cold bacon is just a mouthful of salt.
- [04:13] This is a prime example of sensory interaction; the principle that one sense can influence
- [04:18] another.
- [04:19] I'll get back to smell in just a bit, but I want to take a moment to talk about what
- [04:21] happens when those sensory interactions get messy.
- [04:24] Let us take a little questionnaire, shall we?
- [04:26] Do certain words trigger a strong, specific taste in your mouth?
- [04:30] Like, does the word 'kitten' taste like candy canes?
- [04:33] Has hearing a sound ever made you see a color?
- [04:36] Like does Prince's voice singing Purple Rain actually cause the colour purple to flash
- [04:41] before your eyes?
- [04:42] Do you ever feel like you're being touched when you smell something?
- [04:45] Like does the smell of lilies give you the sensation of touching a cold, metal surface?
- [04:49] Most of you said no to all of those questions, but at least one of you out there answered
- [04:54] yes.
- [04:55] And more likely than not, that person has synesthesia, a rare and fascinating neurological
- [05:00] condition where two or more senses get wrapped together.
- [05:04] This kind of sensory mix up is involuntary, and it's experienced without forethought in
- [05:08] a durable and consistent way.
- [05:10] Like, the number seven is always going to taste like coffee, and it's never going to
- [05:15] switch to tomato juice.
- [05:16] And we're still not sure what causes this phenomenon.
- [05:18] One idea suggests that the rogue development of new neural connections may override normal
- [05:23] boundaries that typically separate the senses.
- [05:25] Another theory suggests that all babies are born with synesthesia and experience mixed
- [05:29] sense until the brain matures and creates separate sense channels, unless they don't,
- [05:33] in which case you grow up to be a synesthete.
- [05:36] Yet another theory links the condition to wonky neurochemistry, in which the neurotransmitters
- [05:40] associated with one function turn up way over in a different part of the brain.
- [05:44] Just another example of how the mind is still extremely mysterious.
- [05:48] So, back to the comparatively boring topic of smells that only smell...
- [05:53] unlike our wave detecting senses of sight and hearing, out taste and smell are chemical
- [05:57] senses.
- [05:58] We differentiate the smells of spring lilacs, grilled cheese, and gasoline when airborne
- [06:02] molecules travel up the nose and reach the five to ten million receptor cells at the
- [06:07] top of each nasal cavity; and yes, that means when you smell poop, there's poop particles
- [06:11] in your nose.
- [06:12] These receptors send information to the brain's olfactory bulb, then zips it on to the primary
- [06:17] smell cortex and parts of the limbic system responsible for emotion and memory.
- [06:21] Unlike our five different taste receptors or two types of retinal receptors, we don't
- [06:25] have specifically differentiated smell receptors, rather, odour receptors come together in different
- [06:31] combinations.
- [06:32] So, just like pressing different keys on your keyboard can allow you to form tons of different
- [06:35] words, so too can these distinct combinations of activated smell receptors communicate some
- [06:39] ten thousand unique smells.
- [06:41] But, how we feel about a smell, and our perception of it, is often tangled up in our experiences
- [06:45] with that scent.
- [06:46] If our beloved grandma baked gingerbread every time we visited, those memories may make you
- [06:51] partial to the smell of gingerbread.
- [06:53] Even if we can't immediately name the odor, our brains are amazing at storing and recognizing
- [06:57] old scents by their associations.
- [06:59] Which is why you may suddenly feel happy when you walk into a bakery, even before you realize
- [07:04] you're thinking of your grandma.
- [07:05] The emotional power of smell partly has to with how our sense circuitry connects to the
- [07:08] brain's limbic system, right next to our emotional registry, the amygdala, and our memory keeper,
- [07:14] the hippocampus.
- [07:15] That's why scents can be so intimately tied with our feelings and memories.
- [07:19] And how a whiff of Nag Champa can immediately transport to back to eating chips in your
- [07:22] freshman dorm room.
- [07:24] Smelling, hearing, tasting, seeing: all fantastic, but if there's one thing that popular music
- [07:28] taught us, besides a bunch of really terrible relationship advice, it's that when it comes
- [07:32] to our senses, we're all about touching.
- [07:34] We've got songs about magic touches and golden touches, invisible and human touches.
- [07:39] Songs about touching ourselves, touching me, touching you, and even what you can't touch.
- [07:43] Touch is extremely important, especially during early development.
- [07:46] Baby monkeys that are allowed to see, hear and smell, but not touch their mamas become
- [07:50] extremely distraught.
- [07:51] That's just a mean experiment.
- [07:53] Premature human babies gain weight faster if they're held and massaged, and some studies
- [07:56] indicated that children that didn't receive enough physical attention as infants are at
- [08:00] higher risk for emotional, behavioral, and social problems as they grow.
- [08:03] Your sense of touch is actually a combination of four distinct skin sensations: pressure,
- [08:07] warmth, cold, and pain.
- [08:09] If you touch various spots of your skin with something soft like this anglerfish, you'll
- [08:14] feel that you sense different amounts of softness on different parts of your body... just put
- [08:20] that up there...
- [08:21] The same goes for a warm mug, or an ice cube, or a needle point.
- [08:24] You'll sense that some spots are more or less sensitive to each of the four distinct sensations.
- [08:29] Other skin sensations, like tickles, itches, and the experience of wetness, are just variations
- [08:33] on those four different sensations.
- [08:35] Ultimately, your sense of touch joins forces with sensors in your bones, joints, and tendons
- [08:40] to provide your personal kinesthesis: the way that body senses its own movement and
- [08:44] positioning.
- [08:45] You use your kinesthetic sense whenever you walk, dance, swim, or hula hoop.
- [08:49] It's what the cops are testing drunk people for when they ask them to touch their noses
- [08:52] with their eyes closed.
- [08:53] This sense allows you to detect changes in the position of your body without relying
- [08:57] on other senses, which is why you can still cha-cha, backstroke, and hula hoop with your
- [09:01] eyes closed and your ears plugged.
- [09:03] The partner sense to your kinesthesis is your vestibular sense, which monitors your head's
- [09:07] position and your balance.
- [09:08] This sense of equilibrium is ruled by the pretzel-shaped, semicircular canals and the
- [09:13] fluid-filled vestibular sacs that connect those canals to the cochlea in your inner
- [09:16] ear.
- [09:17] So, if you spin around a bunch and suddenly stop, it'll take a minute for that inner ear
- [09:21] fluid to return to normal, which is what makes you feel dizzy.
- [09:24] That moving fluid is actually fooling your brain into thinking your body is still spinning.
- [09:28] It's a good example of how even our normal functioning senses can fool us.
- [09:32] Understanding exactly how we get fooled helps us understand how our sensual perception system
- [09:36] works, which is exactly what we're going to be talking about next time.
- [09:39] For now, hopefully you realized that your homunculus is actually kinda beautiful, in
- [09:43] its own way, because you learned how your sense of hearing, taste, smell, and touch
- [09:48] work.

### Transcript (reading)

Every rose has its thorn. Only the good die young. Slow and steady wins the race. And what you see is what you get. Except that in reality, several varieties of roses do not have thorns; both the good and the bad, on occasion, tragically die young; fast and steady beats slow and steady every time; and what you see is, well... Our perception, or how we order the cacophonous chaos of our environment, is heavily influenced, biased even, by our expectations, experiences, moods, and even cultural norms. And we can be pretty good at fooling ourselves. In the last two lessons, we've learned how we see shapes and colors, hear sounds, and smell and taste the world's chemical concoctions, but our senses mean little without our brain's ability to organize

and translate that data into meaningful perceptions. Without perception, your mother's face is just a combination of shapes. Without the ability to interpret scent, we couldn't differentiate the smell of toast from a grease fire. Our perception is the process that allows us to make meaning out of our senses and experience the world around us. it's what makes life understandable, but also it means that sometimes what you see is not actually what you get. [INTRO MUSIC] So that was awesome, right? Upside-down, I look like me. Right-side-up, I look like some kind of terrifying monster. Your brain isn't used to upside-down faces, so it's basically just doing its best to put the pieces together. But it knows exactly what a right-side-up face

should look like, and that is not it. Just one of thousands of examples proving that your brain does all the work of perception, and your eyes really are just feeding raw data. It's important data, but it isn't actually what we see. What we see is the realm of the mind, not the eye. What kind of bird do you see right now? A duck, right? But if I said, "What kind of mammal do you see?" a bunny probably would have popped out at you. Now, you should be seeing both of them popping back and forth, but likely your brain wants to perceive the image related to whichever cue you first heard, or whichever image is more familiar to you. By cueing "mammal" or "bird," I influenced your expectations and you saw what I wanted you to see. Pretty cool!

Your expectations are just one factor in your perceptual set: the psychological factors that determine how you perceive your environment. Sometimes, seeing is believing, but perceptual set theory teaches us that believing is also seeing. Context is another factor in your perceptual set. If the duck bunny thing was pictured with easter eggs all around it, you'd think bunny right away -- which is kind of weird, considering that of ducks and bunnies, one is actually much more likely to be near an egg (it's not the bunny). And that's an example of how culture is also an important part of our perceptual set. As much as our perceptions are affected by context and expectations, they're also swayed by our emotions and motivations. People will say a hill is more steep if they're

listening to emo by themselves than if they're listening to power pop and walking with a friend. Most of the time, your personal perceptual set leads you to reasonable conclusions, but sets can also be misleading or even harmful. They're the basis of tons of entertaining optical illusions. These two tables, for example, are the same size, but the positions of their legs make that impossible for you to believe until I lay them over each other. And while all the fooling of our visual perception can be fun, it also helps us understand how it works. Our minds are given a tremendous amount of information, especially through the eyes, and we need to make quick work of it. Turning marks on a paper into words; blobby lumps into the face of a friend;

seeing depth, color, movement, and contrast; being able to pick out an object from all the other clutter around it seems so simple, but we've come to discover that it is quite complicated. So complicated that we have a name for it: form perception. Take a neat little dynamic called the "figure-ground relationship." It's how we organize and simplify whatever scene we're looking at into the main objects or figures and the surroundings or ground that they stand out against. The classic "faces or vases" illusion is an example. Is it two faces against a white background, or a vase against a black background? If you look long enough, you'll see that the relationship between the object and its surroundings flip back and forth, continually reversing, sometimes white

is the figure and black is the ground. That figure-ground dynamic, though, is always there. The concept applies to non-visual fields as well. Say you're at a party, holding up the wall and creeping on your crush across the room, trying to casually listen in on what they're saying. As the focus of your attention, that voice becomes the figure, while all the other voices jabbering about sports and beer pong and Sherlock and everything that doesn't have to do with that one beautiful person all becomes the ground. Now that your mind has distinguished figure from ground, it has to perceive that form as something meaningful. Like for one, that large shape on the couch is a person, and further, that person isn't just any person, but the

specific unique person of your dreams. One way our minds shuffle all of these stimuli into something coherent is by following rules of grouping, like organizing things by proximity, continuity, or closure. The rule of proximity, for instance, simply states that we like to group nearby figures together. So instead of seeing a random garble of partygoers, we tend to mentally connect people standing next to each other. Like, there's the hockey team over there, and the debate team over there, and then you've got the band geeks -- why are all these people at the same party? We're also drawn to organize our world with attention to continuity, perceiving smooth, continuous patterns, and often ignoring broken ones. We also like closure -- and not just after a breakup. Visually, we want

to fill in gaps to create whole objects. So here, we see an illusory triangle breaking the completion of these circles on the left. But just add the little lines, close up the circles, and you stop seeing the triangle. Form perception is obviously crucial to making sense of the world, or, y'know, a moderately interesting party. But imagine trying to navigate the world without depth perception. As you gaze upon your one true love, the image hits your retina in two dimensions. Yet somehow, you're still able to see the full three-dimensional gloriousness of their form. You can thank your depth perception for that! Depth perception is what helps us estimate an object's distance and full shape. In this case, a nice shape that is

currently too far away from you. It is at least partially innate -- even most babies have it. We're able to perceive depth by using both binocular and monocular visual cues. Binocular cues, as the name gives away, require the use of both eyes. Because your eyes are about 2.5 inches apart, your retinas receive ever-so-slightly different images. You know, camera one, camera two. So when you're looking with both your eyes, your brain compares the two images to help judge distance. The closer the object, the greater the difference between the two images, also known as the retinal disparity. Retinal disparity is pretty easy to see, you just hold your fingers up, and then you look past them, and suddenly you have four instead of two fingers. Because those left and right images vary only

slightly, retinal disparity doesn't help much when it comes to judging far-off distances. For that, we look to monocular cues to help us determine the scale and distance of an object. These are things like relative size and height, linear perspective, texture gradient, and interposition. Relative size allows you to determine that your crush is not supporting a tiny newborn chihuahua on their shoulder, but rather, there's a full-grown chihuahua behind them in the back of the room. In the absence of a chihuahua (or like object), you can also judge distances using your linear perspective. If you've ever made a perspective drawing in art class, you'll remember that parallel lines appear to meet as they move into the distance. Just like the tiled floor,

the sharper the angle of convergence, and the closer the lines together, the greater the distance will seem. And if you've ever looked out at a mountain range or a Bob Ross painting, you'll understand texture gradient as the cue that makes the first ridge appear all rocky and textured, but as your eye follows the ridges into the distance, they become less detailed. And finally, our interposition, or overlap, cue tells us when one object, like this oaf here, blocks our view of something else, your crush, we perceive it as being closer. And in this case, especially annoying. So all these perceptual concepts can be demonstrated with a fixed image, but of course, life involves a lot of movement. At least if you're doing it right.

We use motion perception to infer speed and direction of a moving object. Like, your brain gauges motion based partly on the idea that shrinking objects are retreating and enlarging objects are approaching. The thing is, your brain is easily tricked when it comes to motion. For instance, large objects appear to move much more slowly than small ones going the same speed. And in addition to organizing things by form, depth, and motion, our perception of the world also requires consistency. Or as psychologists call it, constancy. Perceptual constancy is what allows us to continue to recognize an object, regardless of its distance, viewing angle, motion, or illumination, even as it might appear to change color, size, shape, and brightness, depending on the

conditions. Like, we know what a chihuahua looks like, whether it looks like this this, this, or this. In the end, though, your perception isn't just about funky optical illusions. It's about how you understand the world and your place in it, both physically and psychologically. Your sensory organs pull in the world's raw data, which is disassembled into little bits of information and then reassembled in your brain to form your own model of the world. It's like your senses are just collecting a bunch of Legos and your brain can build and rebuild whatever it perceives. A party, your crush, a duck, or a chihuahua. In other words, your brain constructs your perceptions. And if you were correctly constructing your perceptions this lesson,

you learned what forms your perceptual set, how form perception works, and the many visual cues that influence your depth perception.

- [04:51] specific unique person of your dreams. One way our minds shuffle all of these stimuli into
- [04:55] something coherent is by  following rules of grouping,
- [04:58] like organizing things by  proximity, continuity, or closure.
- [05:02] The rule of proximity, for  instance, simply states that
- [05:04] we like to group nearby  figures together. So instead of
- [05:07] seeing a random garble of partygoers, we tend to
- [05:09] mentally connect people  standing next to each other.
- [05:12] Like, there's the hockey team over there, and the debate team over there, and then you've got the
- [05:15] band geeks -- why are all these people at the same party? We're also drawn to organize our world with
- [05:19] attention to continuity,  perceiving smooth, continuous
- [05:22] patterns, and often ignoring  broken ones. We also like
- [05:25] closure -- and not just after  a breakup. Visually, we want
- [05:28] to fill in gaps to create  whole objects. So here, we see
- [05:32] an illusory triangle breaking  the completion of these
- [05:35] circles on the left. But just  add the little lines, close up
- [05:38] the circles, and you stop  seeing the triangle. Form
- [05:40] perception is obviously crucial to making sense
- [05:43] of the world, or, y'know, a  moderately interesting party.
- [05:46] But imagine trying to navigate the world without
- [05:48] depth perception. As you  gaze upon your one true love,
- [05:51] the image hits your retina in  two dimensions. Yet somehow,
- [05:54] you're still able to see  the full three-dimensional
- [05:57] gloriousness of their form. You can thank your
- [06:00] depth perception for that! Depth perception is what helps us estimate an object's distance
- [06:04] and full shape. In this case, a nice shape that is
- [06:07] currently too far away from  you. It is at least partially
- [06:10] innate -- even most babies  have it. We're able to perceive
- [06:12] depth by using both binocular  and monocular visual cues.
- [06:16] Binocular cues, as the name  gives away, require the use
- [06:20] of both eyes. Because your eyes  are about 2.5 inches apart,
- [06:23] your retinas receive  ever-so-slightly different images.
- [06:26] You know, camera one, camera two. So when you're
- [06:28] looking with both your eyes, your brain compares the two images to help judge distance. The closer
- [06:32] the object, the greater the difference between the two images, also known as the retinal disparity.
- [06:37] Retinal disparity is pretty  easy to see, you just hold
- [06:39] your fingers up, and then you look past them, and
- [06:41] suddenly you have four instead of two fingers. Because those left and right images vary only
- [06:46] slightly, retinal disparity doesn't help much when it comes to judging far-off distances.
- [06:50] For that, we look to monocular cues to help us determine the scale and distance of an object.
- [06:55] These are things like relative  size and height, linear
- [06:58] perspective, texture gradient, and interposition.
- [07:01] Relative size allows you to determine that your crush is not supporting a tiny newborn chihuahua
- [07:06] on their shoulder, but  rather, there's a full-grown
- [07:08] chihuahua behind them in the back of the room.
- [07:10] In the absence of a chihuahua  (or like object), you
- [07:13] can also judge distances  using your linear perspective.
- [07:16] If you've ever made a  perspective drawing in art class,
- [07:17] you'll remember that parallel lines appear to meet
- [07:20] as they move into the distance.  Just like the tiled floor,
- [07:23] the sharper the angle of  convergence, and the closer
- [07:25] the lines together, the  greater the distance will seem.
- [07:27] And if you've ever looked out at a mountain range
- [07:29] or a Bob Ross painting, you'll understand texture gradient as the cue that makes the first ridge
- [07:34] appear all rocky and textured, but as your eye follows the ridges into the distance, they become
- [07:38] less detailed. And finally,  our interposition, or overlap,
- [07:42] cue tells us when one object, like this oaf here,
- [07:44] blocks our view of something else, your crush, we perceive it as being closer. And in this case,
- [07:50] especially annoying. So all these perceptual concepts can be demonstrated with a fixed
- [07:53] image, but of course, life involves a lot of movement. At least if you're doing it right.
- [07:57] We use motion perception to infer speed and direction of a moving object.
- [08:01] Like, your brain gauges motion based partly on the idea that shrinking objects are
- [08:05] retreating and enlarging objects are approaching. The thing is, your brain
- [08:08] is easily tricked when it comes to motion. For instance, large objects appear to move
- [08:12] much more slowly than small ones going the same speed. And in addition to organizing
- [08:16] things by form, depth, and motion, our perception of the world also requires consistency. Or as
- [08:22] psychologists call it, constancy. Perceptual constancy is what allows us to continue
- [08:26] to recognize an object, regardless of its distance, viewing angle, motion, or illumination,
- [08:31] even as it might appear to change color, size, shape, and brightness, depending on the
- [08:35] conditions. Like, we know what a chihuahua looks like, whether it looks like this this,
- [08:40] this, or this. In the end, though, your perception
- [08:41] isn't just about funky  optical illusions. It's about
- [08:44] how you understand the world and your place in it, both physically and psychologically.
- [08:49] Your sensory organs pull in the world's raw data,
- [08:52] which is disassembled into  little bits of information
- [08:54] and then reassembled in your brain to form your own model of the world. It's like your senses
- [09:00] are just collecting a bunch  of Legos and your brain
- [09:02] can build and rebuild whatever it perceives.
- [09:05] A party, your crush, a duck, or a chihuahua. In other words, your brain constructs
- [09:11] your perceptions. And if you were correctly constructing your perceptions this lesson,
- [09:15] you learned what forms your perceptual set, how form perception works, and the many
- [09:19] visual cues that influence your depth perception. Thank you for watching, especially to all of our

### Transcript (reading)

Here’s a riddle, my Hobbitses: What’s something we all experience, all the time, that we can’t really measure, and barely have words to define? You can’t hold it in your hand, or take a bite out of it. It isn’t something you learn or practice; it just IS. Consciousness. Every science has certain concepts that are so fundamental, yet abstract, that we have a hard time finding the appropriate words to describe them. Ask a physicist and they’ll tell you energy and space defy simple definitions. Biologists know if something is alive, but have a harder time explaining what life actually is. Ask a psychologist what consciousness is, and you’ll get…you’ll get a slippery answer.

For the purposes of this conversation, we’re going to actually loosely define consciousness as our awareness of ourselves and our environment. It’s this awareness that allows us to take in and organize information from many sources and senses, at once. American psychologist William James thought of consciousness as a continuously moving, shifting, and unbroken stream, hence the term “stream of consciousness.” Others think of it as the brain’s roving flashlight, shining down an unbroken beam of light that highlights one thing, and then moves on to the next. The point is, your conscious experience is forever shifting--for example, right now hopefully you’re focused on the words coming out of my mouth, but with a little shift - your mind

might wander to how you really should shower today, and your chair is uncomfortable, and you suddenly have to pee, and can you believe what Bernice said?! Do I smell pizza? HEY! EYES HERE! WE’RE LEARNING! Beyond that moment-to-moment shifting, consciousness allows us to contemplate life, think about infinity, and ride a unicycle across a tightrope while juggling melons, at least in theory. Our consciousness helps us plan our futures, consider consequences, and reflect on the past. It is both the most familiar, and the most mysterious part of our lives. It’s kind of like The Force -- but for the little universes inside our heads. [INTRO] Throughout our daily lives we flit back and forth between various states of consciousness, including waking, sleeping, and various altered states.

These can occur spontaneously, like dreaming, or be physiologically sparked, like a drug-induced hallucination, or be triggered psychologically, through meditation or hypnosis, for example. We’re going to take the next three episodes to look closely at these different states of consciousness, but let’s start with what it really means to be awake. For centuries, scientists learned what they could about the brain solely through clinical observation. And they learned a lot, for sure, but with today’s technology, we’re actually able to see some of the structures and activity inside a living, working brain - its electrical, metabolic, and magnetic signatures displayed on screens for our wonder and amusement.

The field of cognitive neuroscience is the study of how brain activity is linked with our mental processes, including thinking, perception, memory, and language. Like other kinds of neuroscience, it uses neuroimaging technologies to consider links between specific brain states and conscious experiences. And there’s more than one way to scan a brain. Structural imaging shows the brain’s anatomy, and is useful in identifying large-scale tumors, diseases, and injuries. In contrast, functional imaging shows us electromagnetic or metabolic activity in the brain, like blood flow, to let us observe correlations between specific mental functions and activity in particular brain areas.

So, yes, neuroimaging has been revolutionizing the field of psychology, much like telescopes and microscopes did for astronomy and biology. But on the other hand, some of this technology is very new, and there’s plenty of disagreement about how to interpret neuroimaging findings. Remember, correlation does not equal causation. So, activity in a certain brain region while having certain kinds of thoughts might be useful to know, but it’s not the end of the conversation. We’ve already talked a lot about how function is often localized in the brain and how everything psychological is simultaneously biological--so it stands to reason our thoughts and emotions could in part be illustrated by a bright flare on a dark screen.

We’ve also collected a fair amount of evidence that we don’t just have one layer of consciousness - a single tape playing various tunes - but rather, something more like two layers, each supported by its own personal bio-psycho-social pit crew. I’m talking about one of the dual process models of consciousness--the idea that our conscious, deliberate mind could be saying, look! a squirrel! while our implicit, automatic mind is simultaneously subprocessing like a computer: color: brown, tail: bushy, movement: climbing, distance: 20 meters, association: my sister had a squirrel phobia as a child, implicit bias: I think that squirrels are ruining America. All of which might weigh upon my behavior upon seeing the little guy.

By some estimates, all your senses are scooping up nearly 11 million bits of information, EVERY SECOND. And yet, you consciously register only about 40 at time. So how do we keep focused and filter out all the chatter to actually get stuff done? With selective attention, of course! Selective attention is how we focus our consciousness on one particular stimulus or group of stimuli, effectively tuning out the rest. Your consciousness is like a spotlight on a busy stage. There are other things going on around you that your automatic, subprocessor brain is covertly registering. But for those moments when you shine your spotlight, most of the other stimuli fall away. Try it at home!

Right now, you’re consciously watching this lesson on consciousness. You probably don’t notice the feel of your socks on your feet, or the tongue that’s inside your mouth, always filling up your mouth with tongue! But as soon as I mention it, the spotlight of your attention turns to them, you feel those socks on your feet, and you’re like wow! It’s weird that there’s a tongue in my mouth! The classic auditory example of selective attention is the cocktail party effect. You could be in a room with 47 people jabbering away, and yet be able to concentrate your hearing on one conversation, tuning out the rest of the voices and background music. But, if the couple next to you were to speak your name, suddenly your cognitive radar would

light up and your attention would whip around to the sound of your name, probably trying to figure out if Bernice was talking behind your back again. Bernice!! This roving spotlight of selective attention is pretty handy most of the time, for spies and laypeople alike. But it can also be dangerous, if you’re being dumb, and say, texting and driving. When you shift your primary selective attention from driving to OMG, LOLOLOLOLOL, you also unwittingly activate your selective inattention, which means that you failed to see that cyclist who you almost ran over, which would not only have ruined her life but also yours so DON’T TEXT AND DRIVE! In fact, when your full attention is directed elsewhere, you’d be astounded by the scope of obvious things you fail to notice.

It’s called inattentional blindness. You may have even already been subject to one of the most famous experiments of inattentional blindness...the Invisible Gorilla or, sometimes, the Moonwalking bear. Just google either of those things if you want to be tested on your awareness and then come back. Pretty great, right?! Given the prompt to count the number of passes one team makes, your consciousness is focused on following the players and the ball, nothing else. You don’t see the players in black, they’re the distraction... also you certainly don’t see the dancing gorilla...or bear...whichever one. The original version of this experiment found that about 50% of people didn’t notice that there was A GORILLA WALKING THROUGH THE ROOM!

THAT is how powerfully selective our attention can be. Something to remember next time you’re behind the wheel. But you know who understands and exploits inattentional blindness better than anyone? Magicians! Except they call it misdirection. Famous modern magician Teller, of Penn and Teller, says “Every time you perform a magic trick you’re engaging in a experimental psychology.” And we can’t help but be rubes. Magicians also prey on our change blindness, the psychological phenomenon in which we fail to notice changes in our environment. And no, I don’t mean climate change. I mean the failure to recognize the difference between what was there a moment ago, versus what is there now.

For example, I have changed shirts several times since this lesson started. In a well-known and often-copied experiment, sometimes called the “person swap,” an experimenter will stop someone in a park and ask for directions. And then, during some staged interruption, the original experimenter will leave and be replaced with a totally different person. Half the time, the subject doesn’t even notice. Fun! One of the many perks of studying psychology with me is you learn all kinds of new ways to mess with people! But while change blindness makes for some really cool parlor tricks, this failure to notice certain things can be dangerous -- say, faulty memories lead to false eyewitness testimonies in court, or when friends get deadlocked in a he-said, she-said disagreement.

So, my friends, use The Force. But use it wisely. As one of my favorite psychologists once advised: “A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack.” Actually, that was Yoda. Anyway, the bottom line is, we are far less aware of what’s going on around us than we think we are. And that’s just when we’re awake! Imagine what might slip your notice when you’re half-asleep, drunk, hypnotized, or hallucinating! That’s what we’re gonna talk about next time. Thanks for watching this episode of Crash Course, if you were selectively conscious of my words, you got introduced the our constant struggle to define consciousness, learned a little bit about neuroimaging and its developing role in psychological science, how our consciousness

is split into two pieces, deliberate and automatic, and how the brain can be selectively attentive, selectively inattentive, and blind to changes in some surprisingly major ways.

- [08:10] in court, or when friends get deadlocked in a he-said, she-said disagreement.
- [08:14] So, my friends, use The Force.
- [08:16] But use it wisely.
- [08:17] As one of my favorite psychologists once advised: “A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and
- [08:22] defense, never for attack.”
- [08:23] Actually, that was Yoda.
- [08:25] Anyway, the bottom line is, we are far less aware of what’s going on around us than
- [08:29] we think we are.
- [08:30] And that’s just when we’re awake!
- [08:31] Imagine what might slip your notice when you’re half-asleep, drunk, hypnotized, or hallucinating!
- [08:36] That’s what we’re gonna talk about next time.
- [08:38] Thanks for watching this episode of Crash Course, if you were selectively conscious
- [08:41] of my words, you got introduced the our constant struggle to define consciousness, learned
- [08:46] a little bit about neuroimaging and its developing role in psychological science, how our consciousness
- [08:50] is split into two pieces, deliberate and automatic, and how the brain can be selectively attentive,
- [08:56] selectively inattentive, and blind to changes in some surprisingly major ways.

Comedian Mike Birbiglia was having trouble with sleep. Though not with the actual sleeping part -- one night, while staying in a hotel, he dreamed that a guided missile was on its way to his bed, and in his dream, he jumped out the window to escape it. Unfortunately, he also did this not in his dream. From the second floor. And the window was not open. This little episode cost him 33 stitches and a trip to a sleep specialist. Mike now sleeps in zipped-up mummy bags for his own safety. The lesson here? Sleep is not some break time when your brain, or your body, just goes dormant. Far from it. In truth, sleep is just another state of consciousness. And only in the past few decades have we begun to really plumb its depths -- from why we

sleep in the first place, to what goes on in our brains when we do, to what happens when we can’t sleep. And there is a lot that science has to say about your dreams! Talk about weird! It’s like Sigmund Freud meets Neil Gaiman. So, even though it may seem like you’re dead to the world, when you sleep, your perceptual window remains slightly open. And kinda like Mike Birbiglia’s hotel room window, a trip through it can make for a pretty wild ride. But for your safety and enjoyment, I’m here to guide you through this state of consciousness, where you’ll learn more than a few things about human mind, including your own. And here’s hoping you won’t need any stitches when we’re through.

[INTRO] Technically speaking, sleep is a periodic, natural, reversible and near total loss of consciousness, meaning it’s different than hibernation, being in a coma, or in say, an anesthetic oblivion. Although we spend about a third of our lives sleeping, and we know that it’s essential to our health and survival, there still isn’t a scientific consensus for why we do it. Part of it probably has to do with simple recuperation, allowing our neurons and other cells to rest and repair themselves. Sleep also supports growth, because that’s when our pituitary glands release growth hormones, which is why babies sleep all the time. Plus, sleep has all kinds of benefits for mental function, like improving memory, giving

our brains time to process the events of the day, and boosting our creativity. But even if we’re not quite sure of all the reasons why we sleep, technology has given us great insight into how we sleep. And for that we can thank little Armond Aserinsky. One night in early 1950s Chicago, eight-year-old Armond was tucked into his bed by his father. But this night, instead of getting a kiss on the forehead, little Armond got some electrodes taped to his face. Armond’s dad was Eugene Aserinsky, a grad student looking to test out a new electroencephalograph, or EEG machine, that measures the brain’s electrical activity. That night, as his son slept peacefully, he watched the machine go bonkers with brain

wave patterns, and -- after making sure that his machine wasn’t somehow broken -- discovered that the brain doesn’t just "power down" during sleep, as most scientists thought. Instead, he had discovered the sleep stage we now call REM or rapid eye movement, a perplexing period when the sleeping brain is buzzing with activity, even though the body is in a deep slumber. Aserinsky and his colleague Nathaniel Kleitman went on to become pioneers of sleep research. Since then, sleep specialists armed with similar technology have shown that we experience four distinct stages of sleep, each defined by unique brainwave patterns. Say you’re just going to bed. All day your endocrine system has been releasing “awake” hormones like cortisol.

But with nightfall comes the release of sleepy melatonin hormones from the pineal gland. Your brain is relaxed, but still awake, a level of activity that EEGs measure as alpha waves. You’re feeling sleepy, your breath slows, and suddenly you’re asleep. This exact moment is clearly evident on an EEG reading, as those alpha waves immediately transition to the irregular non-Rapid Eye Movement stage one (NREM-1) waves. It’s in this first stage of sleep you might experience hypnagogic sensations -- those brief moments when you feel like you’re falling, and your body jerks, startling you. As you relax more deeply, you move into NREM-2 stage sleep, as your brain starts exhibiting bursts of rapid brain wave activity called sleep spindles.

You’re now definitely asleep, but you could still be easily awakened. NREM-3 comes with slow rolling delta waves. We now know that you can have brief and fragmentary dreams in the first three stages of sleep, but eventually you’ll get to the most important stage: full REM sleep, that famous stage of sugarplum slumber that makes eyeballs go nuts, grants vivid visual dreams, and provided the namesake for a certain famous rock band. REM sleep is kinda paradoxical. Your motor cortex is jumping all over the place, but your brainstem is blocking those messages, leaving your muscles so relaxed that you’re basically paralyzed. Except for your eyes. That whole sleep cycle repeats itself every 90 minutes or so, transitioning back and forth between the stages of sleep.

Obviously sleep is super important, and lack of sleep is terrible for your health, mental ability, and mood. In fact it’s a predictor for depression, and has been linked to things like weight gain, as your hunger-arousing and -suppressing hormones get out of whack. Sleep deprivation also causes immune system suppression, and slowed reaction time which is why you should not drive sleepy. Of course, a bad night’s sleep here and there is part of life, but there are a host of bona fide sleep disorders out there that can really make life pretty terrible, or in Mike Birbiglia’s case, land you in the emergency room. We’ve got insomnia, which is persistent problems of falling or staying asleep.

And kind of its opposite, narcolepsy, whose sufferers sometimes experience brief, uncontrollable attacks of overwhelming sleepiness, called “sleep attacks.” This, as you can imagine, can get in the way of all sorts of things that you might enjoy doing, like driving, eating, pole-vaulting. Narcolepsy may have several different causes, including a deficiency in the neurotransmitter hypocretin, which helps keep you awake. But in more rare cases, brain trauma, infection, and disease may contribute to it as well. So, that’s rare, but you probably know someone with sleep apnea, the disorder that causes sleepers to temporarily stop breathing, until their decreased oxygen levels wake them up.

Birbiglia, meanwhile, turned out to have a REM sleep behavior disorder, which we don’t fully understand yet, but appears to be associated with a dopamine deficiency. Then we’ve got night terrors, which are as terrible as they sound... spurring increased heart and breathing rates, screaming, and thrashing that’s seldom remembered upon waking. Night terrors are most common in children under seven, and may be spurred by stress, fatigue, sleep deprivation, and sleeping in unfamiliar surroundings. Much like sleepwalking and sleeptalking, night terrors occur during the NREM-3 stage of sleep, and are NOT the same as nightmares, which occur, like most dreaming, during REM sleep.

But oh, in REM sleep, what dreams may come... There you are, running naked as your teeth fall out, being chased down the beach by a Matt Damon centaur. You wake up, feel around your mouth thinking what? What? What?! WHAT?! Welcome to your dreams, those vivid, emotional images racing through your sleeping brain, often providing a backdrop so bizarre that it may seem like David Lynch, Terry Gilliam, and Tim Burton are trying to out-weird each other in a film festival. A really, really long festival, considering the average person spends about six years of their lives dreaming. So yeah, sometimes you have really crazy dreams. But mostly, your average dream usually just sort of unpacks and reshuffles what you did that day.

For example last night I dreamt about Tumblr, cause I spent a lot of time on Tumblr yesterday. If you played Tetris all afternoon, you might dream of blocks falling from the sky. If something traumatic happened to you, your brain might provide you with a nightmare to help extinguish your daytime fears - Thanks, brain! Then again...you might be unable to stop dreaming about the trauma, which we’ll look at in the future when we discuss post-traumatic stress disorder. Our two-track minds of course allow us to register more stimuli than we outwardly acknowledge during the day, and in that way, the sounds of car alarms or stinky dog farts that you might not even have noticed may get incorporated into your dream, too.

And that’s all interesting and weird and sometimes a little gross, but what’s the real purpose of dreaming? Whyyy do we do this? Well, as you might have guessed, there’s more than one idea out there… The study of dreams is is a mix of neuroscience and psychology known as oneirology. Oneiros is the Greek for dream, and if you’re a Neil Gaiman fan you may recognize it as one of the Sandman’s many names. The one that comes with a toga and Orpheus’s head. But Sandman aside, if you want to talk dreams, we might want to start with our old friend Freud. In his landmark 1900 book The Interpretation of Dreams, Freud proposed that our dreams offer us wish-fulfillment. He thought a dream’s manifest content, the stuff you remember in the morning, was a sort

of censored and symbolic version of whatever inner conflict was really going on in that dream’s unconscious, or latent, content. Not surprisingly, the wish-fulfillment theory lacks scientific chops and has for the most part fallen out of favor -- because, really, you can interpret a dream any way you want. Like, sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. Luckily we have some other theories to consider. The information processing theory proposes that our dreams help us sort out and process the day’s events and fix them into our memories. This may be particularly important when it comes to learning and remembering new information, and some studies show that people recall new tasks better after a good REM sleep full of dreams.

But if brainwave readings show us anything, it’s that there’s a lot going on in your brain when you dream, and the physiological function theory suggests that dreaming may promote neural development and preserve neural pathways by providing the brain with stimulation. When our brains are stimulated, they expand their connections more. So, babies, for example, spend much of their sleep time dreaming, perhaps in part to help their brain circuitry develop more quickly. This is similar to the idea that dreams are part of our cognitive development. By this model, dreams draw on our knowledge and understanding of the world, mimicking reality, and engaging those same brain networks that light up when we daydream.

And finally, there are theories that focus on the way REM sleep triggers neural activity, and the idea that dreams are just sort of accidental side-effects, the brain’s attempt to weave a story out of a bunch of random sights, emotions, and memories -- which is how in dreamland you might actually marry that Matt Damon centaur and give birth to a baby with banana fingers and a raccoon tail. For now scientists continue to debate the function of dreams, but one thing we know for sure is that REM sleep is vital, both biologically and psychologically. But, hey, you think your dreams are nut-bar? Next week, we’re looking at other altered states of consciousness, where you’ll learn what your brain really looks like on drugs, and whether you can actually hypnotize someone

to do your evil bidding… or just act like a chicken. For now, if you’ve stayed awake during this episode, you learned about the four stages of sleep -- NREM 1, 2, 3 and REM itself -- as well as some major theories for the psychological purpose of dreaming, including information processing, physiological function, cognitive development, and neural activity models.

Lemme get your mind right about hypnosis. First of all, it’s a real thing -- but it’s probably not what you think it is. All kinds of hypnosis-esque practices have been around for centuries, but the Western version of it -- including the kind that you probably associate with people being made to cluck like chickens on stage -- cropped up around the 18th century, that’s when German physician Franz Mesmer started treating all manner of medical problems by putting patients into a trance-like state, during which he claimed to align their “internal magnetic forces,” which he called “animal magnetism.” And many of these mesmerized patients did feel better, but not because of any magnetism or whatever. Mesmer was inadvertently using the healing power of suggestion.

In addition to his magnetic quackery, other physicians didn’t appreciate Mesmer’s kitschy penchant for wearing capes and playing ethereal music on a glass harmonica, and eventually he was discredited. So were his patients just gullible idiots, or was there something else going on? Well, we’ve previously defined consciousness as our awareness of ourselves and our environment, and consciousness is at work pretty much whenever we’re awake, but also while we’re asleep and dreaming. So hypnosis is a good example of an altered state of consciousness -- when you’re fully conscious in the clinical sense, but also not in what you’d consider a normal waking state. As a person who considers himself only the product of one of several states of consciousness,

this one that I am currently in right now, it’s worth pointing out how TREMENDOUSLY WEIRD THIS IS! My brain has these other gears that it occasionally drops into during which, in a sense, I become not me any more. Altered states can also include things like hallucinations, and the effects of psychoactive drugs. But these states aren’t as uncommon as you might think. In fact, you’ve probably experienced an altered state yourself… even if you’ve never taken an illicit drug or been to a cheesy dinner-theater where the main act wore a glittering turban. [INTRO] So, personal opinions of Mesmer aside, here are some facts and fallacies worth knowing about hypnosis. First off, let’s define hypnosis simply as a calm, trance-like state during which

you tend to have heightened concentration and focus, and in which you’re typically more open to suggestion. The phenomenon has been observed in lots of empirically rigorous studies, and it’s been used effectively in treatments for stress and anxiety, weight loss, and chronic pain. BUT! It’s important to understand that even though you’re more open to suggestion when hypnotized, you do NOT lose control over your behavior. So, contrary to what you might see in The Manchurian Candidate or Zoolander, hypnosis can’t make you act totally against your will and, say, jump off a building, rob a donut shop, or commit a murder most foul. Nor is hypnosis a reliable way to enhance the recall of deeply buried memories. We don’t

file away every single one of our experiences. We only permanently store some of them, and even they tend to mutate over time. We’ll be talking all about memory in an upcoming lesson. Finally, only about 20 percent of us are thought to be highly hypnotizable. Those are the folks whom a hypnotist could get to smile at the smell of sour milk just by suggesting it was rosewater. And even though we know hypnosis can increase your suggestibility, there’s still some disagreement about what exactly constitutes a hypnotic state, or how it’s achieved. Remember, just because we observe a phenomenon doesn’t mean that we have a clue about its mechanisms of action, or whether it works the way we think it works.

One popular theory looks at hypnosis as phenomenon of social influence. This camp suggests that, like actors caught up in an intense role, hypnotized subjects may begin to feel and act like “good hypnotic subjects” if they just trust their hypnotist to sort of act like a director and focus their attention. Other researchers suggest that it has more to do with a special dual-processing state of split-consciousness called dissociation. Dissociation is a sort of detachment from your surroundings, which can range from mild spacing out all the way up to a total loss of your sense of yourself. It’s something we all do to some degree or another, and we’re often quite aware that we’re doing it. It’s not hard to think of instances where dissociation might even help us, like when we’re faced

with a dangerous situation that requires quick, reflexive action and not a ton of focus on our own thoughts and feelings. In this way, hypnosis may ease pain, not by magically blocking pain receptors, but by helping us selectively not attend to that pain. Clinicians can do this by basically guiding the patient into a very relaxed, but voluntary state, sort of spaced-out, and then further guiding them through a series of positive thoughts and suggestions. So, in legitimate clinical hypnosis, people aren’t being made to dissociate. Instead, think of them as being asked to dissociate - and some people are better at this than others, which is essentially what being “highly hypnotizable” means. So, clearly there’s a lot going on in our

two-track brains at any given time, and hypnosis -- as researchers understand it -- seems to help us tap into some of that adaptive dissociative capacity that we all seem to have. But say you’re not so into the idea of someone feeding you suggestions. Probably the most classic way to voluntarily enter an altered state of consciousness is by using drugs. Most of us have used some kind of legal drug… your morning coffee, a beer at lunch, some Tylenol PM to put you the bed… and lots and lots of folks responsibly use prescription and nonprescription drugs. But of course, some people develop problems. The more you use a substance, legal or illegal, the less you feel its effects as your tolerance grows. And soon enough, a two-beer buzz turns

into a four-beer buzz or a case-of-beer buzz. That’s your brain chemistry adapting to offset the drug effect in a process called neuroadaptation. Keep on that road and soon you’ll risk a physical and/or psychological addiction to the substance you choose, or the substance that chose you. And that’s not even to mention serious physiological and neurological damage, as happens with severe and long-term alcohol abuse. We’ll be delving more deeply into the science of addiction in an upcoming episode, but for now, let’s take a look at some of these drug families and how they jack you up, knock you out, make you do dumb things, see imaginary stuff, and generally alter your consciousness. Psychoactive drugs are chemical substances

that alter your mood and perception. They’re the ones that go right to your brain’s synapses, mimicking the functions of neurotransmitters. They also work by tapping into the psychological component - in other words, the user’s expectations about what substance use might mean. Like if you really believe that drinking tequila makes you more aggressive, and I give you a virgin margarita, your mere expectation of getting all surly and aggro may actually lead you to punch someone in the neck. That’s also called the placebo effect. Whether smoked, snorted, ingested, or injected, we’ll put all of them into three general categories: depressants, stimulants, and hallucinogens. Depressants, like alcohol, tranquilizers,

and opiates, do exactly what you’d expect--they bring the mellow, slow body functions, and suppress neural activity. Historically, the world’s favorite depressant is alcohol. Beat writer William S. Burroughs even called it “our national drug.” A little bit of hooch may get the party started, but not because it’s stimulating anyone. Rather, it’s acting as a disinhibitor, impairing your brain’s judgement areas, while reducing your self-awareness and self-control. And then because alcohol disrupts memory formations you may wake up wondering where one of your eyebrows went. Similar to booze, tranquilizers, or barbiturates, depress nervous system activity and may be prescribed to ease anxiety or insomnia, though

high doses can negatively affect memory and judgement. And really high doses, or bad interactions with other substances like alcohol, can kill you. Opiates, like poppy-flower superstar opium and its derivatives morphine and heroin, work in a similar way, depressing neural activity and enveloping the brain in a fog of no-pain bliss. The thing is, if a brain keeps getting flooded with outside opiates, it will eventually stop brewing its own natural pain killing neurotransmitters, endorphins. The resulting withdrawal is particularly nasty. Stimulants, obviously, excite rather than suppress neural activity, and speed up body functions, bringing up your energy, self-confidence, and changing your mood. On the legal end of the spectrum here, we’ve got caffeine, nicotine,

and prescription amphetamines, building up to the more serious illegal stuff like street amphetamines, meth, Ecstasy, and cocaine. And you know who loved his coke? Freud. He loved i—t so much—it cheered him up when we was feeling down, opened up his mind, and turned him into chatty Kathy. He even wrote his first big publication, “Über Coca” in 1884 about it. During his famous coke years in his late 20s and 30s, he believed that the drug was a viable cure for morphine addiction. Which… not so much. Luckily he gave his nose a rest and finally dropped the habit by his 40s to focus full-time on his cigar addiction. Which is the thing that ultimately killed him. Cocaine hits the bloodstream in a flash of energetic euphoria that quickly taxes the

brain’s supply of dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. Methamphetamine also triggers the release of dopamine. You’ll remember from our lesson on neurotransmitters how these chemical messengers affect our moods, emotions, attention, and alertness. So when those neurotransmitters are excessively activated, they can become temporarily depleted, which is what causes that agitated, depressive crash that users often feel. If you drink coffee every morning, and then you skip a day, you’ll likely be tired and cranky with a pounding headache. Now multiply that awful feeling by like thousands and you’ll see why people with coke and meth addictions might keep chasing that high while their bodies and lives fall apart around them. In addition to depressants and stimulants,

we’ve got hallucinogens, which come in a variety of plant and fungal forms, as well as synthetic forms like LSD or lysergic acid diethylamide. Also called psychedelics, these drugs distort perceptions and evoke sensory images in the absence of actual sensory input. Which means you could end up seeing, hearing, smelling, or feeling things that are not real. This could be quite nice, if you’re like, petting baby dolphins or something, but it could also be panic-inducing and generally messed up, if you think you’ve got a bunch of centipedes crawling under your skin. The thing is, there are lots of ways to involuntarily hallucinate without the use of drugs. Seizures, brain injuries, diseases, sensory deprivation,

fever, stress, or even extreme grief or depression can all cause neurological disturbances that spur hallucinations of one kind or another. Many healthy people have reported experiencing vivid auditory hallucinations when in emergencies, like, you broke your knee skiing and you wanted to just fall asleep forever in that blanket of soft snow, but a strong, seemingly audible voice ordered you to KEEP MOVING. And bizarrely, it isn’t uncommon for people who lose the use of one sense—like vision or smell--to perceive sights and odors they are no longer capable of sensing as their brains pull from old memories to produce hallucinations as a way to compensate for that loss. All this just goes to show that whether you’re

a psychologist, neuroscientist, or philosopher, our various states of consciousness provide a rich, complex world of inquiry to contemplate, showing yet again, just what a messy and marvelous thing the human mind is. If your consciousness wasn’t too altered today, you learned what hypnosis is and what it can and can’t do; how psychoactive depressant, stimulant, and hallucinogenic drugs work on the brain; and how non-drug induced hallucinations can happen to anyone.

So, the name Ivan Pavlov rings a bell it's because his experiments are among the most famous in the history of psychology. His work contributed to the foundation of the behaviorist school of thought that viewed psychology as an empirically rigorous science, focused on observable behaviors and not unobservable internal mental processes. Even though today we view psychology as the science of both behavior and mental processes, Pavlov's influence was tremendous. His research helped pave the path for more experimental rigor and behavioral research right up to the present day. Born in 1849 in Russia, Pavlov was never much for psychology. After giving up on his original aspiration to become a Russian Orthodox priest like his father,

he instead earned a medical degree and spent nearly 20 years studying the digestive system, earning Russia's first Nobel Prize in his mid-50s for his research expanding our understanding of how stomachs worked. He didn't study human stomachs, though, because the procedures were terrible and cruel. He studied dog stomachs. And while researching those dogs, he noticed how the animals would salivate at a mere whiff of their dinner. At first, he found all that slobber annoying, but soon started to suspect that this behavior was actually a simple but important form of learning. For us scholars of psychology, we can define learning as the process of acquiring, through experience, new and relatively enduring information or behaviors. Whether through association,

observation, or just plain thinking, learning is what allows us to adapt to our environments and to survive. And as Pavlov began to discover, it wasn't only humans who learned. Soon enough, he was turning out his famous series of experiments in which he paired the presence of meat powder -- yummy -- which got the dogs to drooling, with lots of different neutral stimuli. Things that wouldn't normally make you drool, like a certain sound or shining a light or a touch on the leg. Then Pavlov observed, after several of these pairings, a dog would start to drool just at the sound or the light or the touch, even if there wasn't any slobber-inducing meat powder around. Animals, he found, can exhibit associative learning. That's when a subject links certain events, behaviors,

or stimuli together in the process of conditioning. This may be the most elemental, basic form of learning a brain can do, but that doesn't mean that the processes behind conditioning are, or ever were, obvious, or, for that matter, simple. In fact, the research that's gone into how we're conditioned by our environments has helped shape the science of psychology from a still-kinda-subjective thought exercise into the more rigorous discipline we know today. And it starred some of psychology's most notable, and often controversial, figures including Pavlov, BF Skinner, and that guy who trained kids to be terrified of furry animals. [INTRO MUSIC] Okay, I'm not a licensed dog trainer (do they license dog trainers?),

but I can break down for you the sequence of steps in Pavlov's famous experiment to help you get a sense of how conditioning works. First, before conditioning, the dog just drools when it smells food. That smell is the unconditioned stimulus and the slobbering, the unconditioned or natural response. The ringing sound, which at this point means nothing to the dog, is the neutral stimulus, and it produces no drooling. During conditioning, the unconditioned stimulus -- the food smell -- is paired with the neutral stimulus -- the bell sound -- and results in drooling. This is repeated many times until the association between the two stimuli is made in a stage called acquisition. By the time you get to the after-conditioning

phase, that old neutral stimulus has become a conditioned stimulus, because it now elicits the conditioned response of drooling. Sounds super simple, right? If you have a dog, you've probably seen it tap-dance at the sight of a leash, but in Pavlov's day, this whole series of steps hadn't really been studied in a lab setting, or even thought about in scientific terms. Pavlov's work suggested that classical conditioning, as this kind of learning came to be known, could be an adaptive form of learning that helps an animal survive by changing its behavior to better suit its environment. In this case, a bell means food, and food means survival, so get ready! Not only, that but methodologically, classical conditioning shows how a process like learning can

actually be studied through direct observation of behavior in real-time, without all those messy feelings and emotions. This is something Pavlov especially appreciated, given his disdain for "mentalistic concepts" like consciousness and introspection, championed by Freud. Behaviorist psychologists like Pavlov's younger American analogs, BF Skinner and John B Watson, also embraced the notion that psychology was all about objective, observable behavior. In his 1930 book, Behaviorism, he argued that given a dozen healthy infants, he could train any one of them to be a doctor, artist, lawyer, or even a thief, regardless of their talents, tendencies, or ancestry. Woah there, Watson! Thankfully, no one gave him any infants.

In his most famous, and yes, controversial experiment, Watson conditioned a young child dubbed "Little Albert" to fear a white rat. Maybe that doesn't sound so bad, but he accomplished this by pairing the rat with a loud scary noise over and over. And then demonstrated that the terror could branch out and be generalized to include other furry white objects, like bunnies, dogs, and even fur coats. So yeah, that would not fly today, obviously. But Watson's research did make other psychologists wonder whether adults, too, were just holding tanks of conditioned emotions. And if so, whether new conditioning could be used to undo old conditioning. Like, if you're terrified of rollercoasters, but you made yourself ride one ten times a day for two weeks,

would your fears fade? For the record, recent exploration has revealed that the boy known as "Little Albert" sadly died a few years after these experiments, while Watson eventually left academia and got into advertising, where he put all that associative learning to lucrative use. So that's classical conditioning, but we've also got another kind of associative learning: operant conditioning. If classical conditioning is all about forming associations between stimuli, operant conditioning involves associating our own behavior with consequences. The kid who gets a cookie for saying "please," or the aquarium seal that gets a sardine for balancing a ball on its nose -- they've both been trained with operant conditioning. The basic premise here is that behaviors increase

when followed by reinforcement or reward, but they decrease when followed by punishment. And the most well-known champion of operant conditioning is American behaviorist, B.F. Skinner. He designed the famous operant chamber or "Skinner Box" -- a confined space containing a lever or button than an animal can touch to get some kind of reward (typically food), along with the device that keeps track of its responses. Okay, time for a debunking break. Other than maybe Freud, no other figure in psychology seems to be as shrouded in lore and misinformation as B.F. Skinner. So I'm just gonna tell you straight that no, Skinner never put any kids in the box, and no, he didn't raise his children without love or affection. And his daughter didn't

hate his guts until the day she committed suicide. Deborah Skinner is alive and well and she loved her dad plenty. Skinner did, however, invent something called an "Air Crib" -- a climate-controlled box with a window on the front that was meant to keep babies warm and safe while their moms ran around doing their 1950s lady thang. It's not exactly where I'd like to spend the night, but it wasn't remotely the same as the Skinner Box. No one knows where all these myths came from, but being a somewhat controversial guy, Skinner had a lot of haters. Some of whom were probably happy to perpetuate misinformation. But back to the rat in the box. Basically, the box provided an observable stage to demonstrate Skinner's concept of reinforcement, which is

anything that increases the behavior that it follows. In other words, you push the lever, you get a snack, and then you want to keep pushing the lever. But most rats aren't gonna push a lever for no reason. I mean, there aren't food dispensing levers in the natural environment. So operant conditioning behavior requires shaping. Maybe you give the rat a little nibble of food each time it gets closer to the bar, then only when it touches the bar, until little by little, in a series of successive approximations to the desired behavior, you reward them only when they do the thing you're trying to shape them to do. In everyday life, we're all continually reinforcing, shaping, and refining each other's behaviors, both intentionally and accidentally.

We do this with both positive and negative reinforcement. Positive reinforcement obviously strengthens responses by giving rewards after a desired event, like the rat snack after the lever push, or getting a cookie when you say please. Negative reinforcement is a little trickier -- it's what increases a behavior by taking away an aversive or upsetting stimulus, like, say, you get in your car and it does that infernal beeping thing until you fasten your seat belt. The car is reinforcing your seatbelt-wearing by getting rid of that horrible beeping. And it's good. You should wear your seatbelt. It's important to recognize here that negative reinforcement is not the same as punishment.

Punishment decreases a behavior, either positively, by, say, getting a speeding ticket, or negatively, by taking away a driver's license. But negative reinforcement removes the punishing event to increase the behavior. So pain killers negatively reinforce the behavior of swallowing them by ending the headache. So by now, hopefully, you're getting the picture. There are things that we want and things that we don't want, and we can be taught by way of those impulses to behave certain ways. But it's worth pointing out that the conditioning is way more complex than just the cookie in the beeping car. For one thing, ending annoyance or getting a cookie are types of primary reinforcers. You don't have to learn that; they just make innate biological sense. Beeping is

annoying; cookies are delicious. So there are other kinds of reinforcers that we only recognize after we learn to associate them with primary reinforcers, like a paycheck is a conditioned reinforcer. We want money because we need food and shelter, which are still the primary drivers, plus just as there are different kinds of reinforcers, so are there various reinforcement schedules. Like, those box rats were getting continuous reinforcement when they got a treat every single time they hit the lever, so they picked it up pretty quickly. But if one day, the rat chow doesn't come, that connection quickly dwindles and the rat stops hitting the lever. This is a process called extinction, and it is important because that's how real life works. Outside

of a Skinner Box, you're not gonna get continuous reinforcement. All of life is a series of partial or intermittent reinforcements that only occurs sometimes. Learning under these conditions takes longer, but it holds up better in the long run, and is less susceptible to that extinction. So, say a cafe gives out a free cup of coffee for every 10 you buy, while another shop pours a free double shot every Tuesday morning, and yet another has a free coffee lottery that customers win at random. These are all different kinds of intermittent reinforcement techniques that get customers coming back for more. Now, Pavlov, Watson, and Skinner's ideas were definitely controversial, as well as the whole scary rat experiment, plenty of

folks disagreed with their insistence that only external influences and not internal thoughts and feelings shaped behavior. It was clear to many of the behaviorists' rivals that our cognitive processes -- our thoughts, perceptions, feelings, memories -- also influence the way we learn. We're gonna talk about how these other things factor into learning next week, when we look more at conditioning, cognition, and observational learning. And yeah, also watch kids beat the face off blowup dolls. Today, though, you learned how associative learning works; the essentials of behaviorist theory; the basic components of classical and operant conditioning, including positive and negative reinforcement; and reinforcement scheduling.

- [00:00] So, the name Ivan Pavlov rings a bell it's because his experiments are among
- [00:05] the most famous in the history of psychology. His work contributed to the
- [00:09] foundation of the behaviorist school of thought that viewed psychology as an
- [00:13] empirically rigorous science, focused on observable behaviors and not
- [00:17] unobservable internal mental processes. Even though today we view psychology as
- [00:21] the science of both behavior and mental processes, Pavlov's influence was
- [00:25] tremendous. His research helped pave the path for
- [00:28] more experimental rigor and behavioral research right up to the present day.
- [00:32] Born in 1849 in Russia, Pavlov was never much for psychology. After giving up on
- [00:37] his original aspiration to become a Russian Orthodox priest like his father,
- [00:41] he instead earned a medical degree and spent nearly 20 years studying the
- [00:46] digestive system, earning Russia's first Nobel Prize in his mid-50s for his
- [00:50] research expanding our understanding of how stomachs worked. He didn't study
- [00:54] human stomachs, though, because the procedures were terrible and cruel.
- [00:59] He studied dog stomachs. And while researching those dogs, he noticed how
- [01:03] the animals would salivate at a mere whiff of their dinner. At first, he found
- [01:07] all that slobber annoying, but soon started to suspect that this behavior
- [01:11] was actually a simple but important form of learning. For us scholars of
- [01:15] psychology, we can define learning as the process of acquiring, through experience,
- [01:19] new and relatively enduring information or behaviors. Whether through association,
- [01:24] observation, or just plain thinking, learning is what allows us to adapt to
- [01:29] our environments and to survive. And as Pavlov began to discover, it wasn't only
- [01:33] humans who learned. Soon enough, he was turning out his famous series of
- [01:37] experiments in which he paired the presence of meat powder -- yummy -- which got
- [01:41] the dogs to drooling, with lots of different neutral stimuli. Things that
- [01:45] wouldn't normally make you drool, like a certain sound or shining a light or a
- [01:49] touch on the leg. Then Pavlov observed, after several of these pairings, a dog
- [01:53] would start to drool just at the sound or the light or the touch, even if there
- [01:57] wasn't any slobber-inducing meat powder around. Animals, he found, can exhibit
- [02:01] associative learning. That's when a subject links certain events, behaviors,
- [02:05] or stimuli together in the process of conditioning. This may be the most
- [02:09] elemental, basic form of learning a brain can do, but that doesn't mean that the
- [02:12] processes behind conditioning  are, or ever were, obvious,
- [02:16] or, for that matter, simple.
- [02:17] In fact, the research that's gone into how we're conditioned by our environments has helped shape

### Transcript (reading)

It’s 1961. You’re wandering around Stanford University, looking for a sandwich or something when you happen to walk by a particular room in a particular lab, and see something a little unnerving. Namely, you find a woman punching an inflatable clown named Bobo in the neck. Over and over in its neck. This was the lab of legendary psychologist Albert Bandura, and in 1961 he was studying one of the most important phenomena in psychology. See, while the woman was throttling that big inflatable clown, there was a child watching her. And after about ten minutes of observing this clown-beating display, the kid was taken to a room full of fun toys, which were soon taken away, and then the frustrated kid was left alone with Bobo, and Bandura watched what happened.

And yeah, what happened was kind of scary. Kids who watched the woman beating the clown were much more likely to mimic her aggression -- kicking, punching, throwing, even attempting to maul Bobo with a hammer. But other children who saw an adult playing nicely with the doll, or just ignoring it, didn’t respond the same way in their frustration. Bandura’s results may seem predictable now, but in those days, they challenged the dominant behaviorist views that we talked about last week -- the views that learning is solely about conditioning and association, rewards and punishments. Bandura’s research focused on how learning can occur through observing and imitating someone else’s behavior.

And if that seems obvious to you, you have Bandura to thank for that. His research hastened the evolution of 20th century experimental psychology from pure behaviorism into what we now know as social-cognitive learning. While it was closely related to behaviorism, the social-cognitive models added profoundly new dimensions to what Skinner and Watson and Pavlov had observed in our feathered and furry friends. In other words, it showed us that -- just as there’s more than one way to beat up a clown -- there’s way more than one way to learn. [INTRO] Last week we talked about the differences between classical and operant conditioning in associative learning -- the kind of learning that comes from connecting different events and stimuli.

In classical conditioning, this means associating a stimulus with some kind of involuntary response -- the whole dog slobbering at the sound of a bell phenomenon -- whereas operant conditioning makes associations between stimulus and a voluntary behavior -- like the rat pressing a lever to get delicious snacks, or jumping out of a cage to escape an electrical shock. And that’s all well and good, but if learning is the process of acquiring and retaining new behavior and information, then Bandura’s experiments showed us that conditioning with external rewards, punishments, or other stimuli isn’t the only way to do it. It’s hard to deny that pretty much all animals are capable of learning certain things by

association, but critics of behaviorists like Pavlov, Watson, and Skinner had a problem with their assertions that, when it came to learning, it didn’t matter much whether you’re training rats, pigeons, or people--it’s all the same. Because, lots of research has demonstrated that an animal’s capacity for conditioning is actually limited by its biology. Consider this scenario: Say I get a raging case of food poisoning after eating my head-weight in raw oysters with my friend Bernice. I’m probably not going to want to touch oysters again for a long, long time, because I associate their smell and taste with the smell and taste they made when I was — when they were coming back out, is what I’m trying to say.

But, that doesn’t mean that the sight of Bernice, or the sound of the sea shanties they were playing at the restaurant would make me barf, because humans are, by our very nature, more taste averse than we are sight or sound averse. On the other hand, sight-oriented animals, like birds, may be biologically predisposed to avoid tainted food by sight, since that’s how they hunt and forage. And presumably they go to restaurants that play better music. Anyway, all of this tells us that species can more easily learn associations that help them thrive or survive, and that not all associations are learned equally. It’s a lot easier to teach a pigeon to peck an X on the ground to obtain a food reward than it is get it to flap its wings to get that same reward, because pecking is a natural

foraging behavior for a pigeon. In the same way, it would be much harder for the bird to learn to peck that X to avoid a shock, rather than to flap its wings to avoid the shock, because flying away from danger is what pigeons naturally do. Learned associations are even more complicated in humans of course, because what we learn doesn’t only influence our behavior, it also shapes our attitudes. Our cognition -- that is, our thoughts, perspectives, and expectations -- is important for learning, as is our social context, as Bandura figured out. So, Pavlov-style conditioning experiments that ignore those social-cognitive elements can really run into trouble. For example, someone under treatment for an alcohol addiction may be given booze laced with a nauseating drug.

According to the pure classical conditioning model, that person would then equate booze with feeling nasty. But the brain can override this association if it’s aware that it’s the added drug, and not the alcohol, is the thing that’s causing the illness. Sometimes we can think our way out of intended associations. And by the same token, a person’s social context - like, their friends, family traditions, or life stressors - can reinforce something like alcohol consumption more than the nauseating pill could ever punish it. Plus, we also do a lot of latent learning, like without even knowing it. Have you ever been walking around a new city, someone stops you to ask directions, and you surprise yourself by actually being able to tell that tourist how to get to the park?

That’s because we’re constantly developing cognitive maps, or mental representations of our surroundings, without explicitly telling ourselves to do it. We’ve all seen the experiments with in mazes: Well, those show us that even rats develop these cognitive maps, figuring out how to get around, even if there’s no reward at the end. And days later, when they finally do get food at the end of the maze, they quickly demonstrate all that earlier latent learning by scuttling through the maze as fast, or faster, than rats that had been rewarded all along. So, learning isn’t just about associating a response with a consequence. There’s thinking happening, too. And this kind of thinking is also a big part of observational learning, which is basically

learning by watching other people, or being influenced by them in other ways. Because, you don’t need direct experience to learn. You can just pick up stuff up through modeling -- not like modeling on the catwalk, I just mean observing and imitating specific behaviors. Rats, crows, pigeons, primates, and other animals learn through imitation. Chimps learn how to use sticks to fish ants out of a nest this way. One study found rhesus macaques were usually slow to make up after a fight unless they grew up watching more forgiving older macaques, in which case they tended to make up more quickly. Of course we humans learn A LOT from modeling -- I mean, most of our popular culture is based on it: new slang, skinny jeans, foodie trends, pixie cuts -- they’re all racing

around the globe through observation and imitation. So it makes a lot of sense that social observation shapes behavior, especially in children. Which brings us back to Bobo. Again, the fact that we learn by imitating, even when we don’t mean to, seems pretty intuitive, but until Bandura’s famous experiment, it hadn’t been studied in a scientific way. I mean, these kids started abusing Bobo not just with little toddler punches, but with hostile language and even using things, like toy guns, that they previously had no interest in -- and all because they saw aggressive modeling in action. And since Bandura’s time, technology has allowed us to peer even deeper into this dynamic.

Neuroimaging in humans, for instance, has shown that when an individual watches someone else, especially someone whom they relate to, receive an award or score a goal or something, their own brain’s reward systems light up vicariously. Italian researchers found this out pretty much by accident in the early 1990s: They were studying signals from key regions in a lab monkey’s brain that were associated with planning and doing. Their brain-monitoring device buzzed softly when the monkey did something like pick up a piece of fruit and eat it. But one hot day, a researcher came back from lunch licking an ice cream cone, and suddenly heard the animal’s brain monitor buzz -- the monkey was watching him, and his brain worked as if it was actually doing the licking.

Many scientists suspect that this is the work of a previously unknown type of brain cell called mirror neurons, which fire when a subject both performs an action, and when they observe someone else doing it. Mirror neuron research is still relatively new, and we’re still figuring them out, but combined with Bandura’s earlier work, it’s revealing a strong connection between observation, imitation, and learning. So the takeaway here is: Models are important! And not just Gisele and Antonio Sabato Junior. You can, if you want, observe and imitate them; I’m just saying that observational, social learning starts really early, and parental figures are powerful role models. Positive, supportive, and loving models usually prompt similar behavior in others, just as

negative, aggressive modeling can spark antisocial effects. And, as we’ll talk about later, what we see and feel and learn as children is not easily displaced when we’re adults. Literary giant George Bernard Shaw wrote, “Imitation is not just the sincerest form of flattery - it's the sincerest form of learning.” And British statesman Lord Chesterfield once said, “We are, in truth, more than half what we are by imitation.” Even if these ideas were only half-true, they’d still be a powerful lesson on who you choose to spend your time with, and how you choose to act. If you learned anything by watching me today, hopefully it involved the limitations of classical and operant conditioning, the basics of cognitive, observational, and social learning, a look

at mirror neurons, and how to beat up a Bobo doll. Thanks for watching, especially to all of our Subbable subscribers, who make this whole channel possible.

- [00:00] It’s 1961.
- [00:01] You’re wandering around Stanford University, looking for a sandwich or something when you
- [00:05] happen to walk by a particular room in a particular lab, and see something a little unnerving.
- [00:10] Namely, you find a woman punching an inflatable clown named Bobo in the neck.
- [00:17] Over and over in its neck.
- [00:19] This was the lab of legendary psychologist Albert Bandura, and in 1961 he was studying
- [00:25] one of the most important phenomena in psychology.
- [00:29] See, while the woman was throttling that big inflatable clown, there was a child watching
- [00:34] her.
- [00:35] And after about ten minutes of observing this clown-beating display, the kid was taken to
- [00:40] a room full of fun toys, which were soon taken away, and then the frustrated kid was left
- [00:45] alone with Bobo, and Bandura watched what happened.
- [00:48] And yeah, what happened was kind of scary.
- [00:51] Kids who watched the woman beating the clown were much more likely to mimic her aggression
- [00:55] -- kicking, punching, throwing, even attempting to maul Bobo with a hammer.
- [00:59] But other children who saw an adult playing nicely with the doll, or just ignoring it,
- [01:03] didn’t respond the same way in their frustration.
- [01:05] Bandura’s results may seem predictable now, but in those days, they challenged the dominant
- [01:10] behaviorist views that we talked about last week -- the views that learning is solely
- [01:14] about conditioning and association, rewards and punishments.
- [01:17] Bandura’s research focused on how learning can occur through observing and imitating
- [01:21] someone else’s behavior.
- [01:22] And if that seems obvious to you, you have Bandura to thank for that.
- [01:27] His research hastened the evolution of 20th century experimental psychology from pure
- [01:30] behaviorism into what we now know as social-cognitive learning.
- [01:34] While it was closely related to behaviorism, the social-cognitive models added profoundly
- [01:39] new dimensions to what Skinner and Watson and Pavlov had observed in our feathered and
- [01:43] furry friends.
- [01:44] In other words, it showed us that -- just as there’s more than one way to beat up
- [01:46] a clown -- there’s way more than one way to learn.
- [01:52] [INTRO]
- [01:55] Last week we talked about the differences between classical and operant conditioning
- [02:02] in associative learning -- the kind of learning that comes from connecting different events
- [02:06] and stimuli.
- [02:07] In classical conditioning, this means associating a stimulus with some kind of involuntary response
- [02:12] -- the whole dog slobbering at the sound of a bell phenomenon -- whereas operant conditioning
- [02:17] makes associations between stimulus and a voluntary behavior -- like the rat pressing
- [02:21] a lever to get delicious snacks, or jumping out of a cage to escape an electrical shock.
- [02:25] And that’s all well and good, but if learning is the process of acquiring and retaining
- [02:29] new behavior and information, then Bandura’s experiments showed us that conditioning with
- [02:34] external rewards, punishments, or other stimuli isn’t the only way to do it.
- [02:38] It’s hard to deny that pretty much all animals are capable of learning certain things by
- [02:43] association, but critics of behaviorists like Pavlov, Watson, and Skinner had a problem
- [02:47] with their assertions that, when it came to learning, it didn’t matter much whether
- [02:51] you’re training rats, pigeons, or people--it’s all the same.
- [02:53] Because, lots of research has demonstrated that an animal’s capacity for conditioning
- [02:57] is actually limited by its biology.
- [02:59] Consider this scenario: Say I get a raging case of food poisoning after eating my head-weight
- [03:04] in raw oysters with my friend Bernice.
- [03:06] I’m probably not going to want to touch oysters again for a long, long time, because
- [03:11] I associate their smell and taste with the smell and taste they made when I was — when
- [03:16] they were coming back out, is what I’m trying to say.
- [03:18] But, that doesn’t mean that the sight of Bernice, or the sound of the sea shanties
- [03:21] they were playing at the restaurant would make me barf, because humans are, by our very
- [03:25] nature, more taste averse than we are sight or sound averse.
- [03:28] On the other hand, sight-oriented animals, like birds, may be biologically predisposed
- [03:32] to avoid tainted food by sight, since that’s how they hunt and forage.
- [03:36] And presumably they go to restaurants that play better music.
- [03:39] Anyway, all of this tells us that species can more easily learn associations that help
- [03:42] them thrive or survive, and that not all associations are learned equally.
- [03:46] It’s a lot easier to teach a pigeon to peck an X on the ground to obtain a food reward
- [03:50] than it is get it to flap its wings to get that same reward, because pecking is a natural
- [03:55] foraging behavior for a pigeon.
- [03:56] In the same way, it would be much harder for the bird to learn to peck that X to avoid
- [04:00] a shock, rather than to flap its wings to avoid the shock, because flying away from
- [04:04] danger is what pigeons naturally do.
- [04:06] Learned associations are even more complicated in humans of course, because what we learn
- [04:10] doesn’t only influence our behavior, it also shapes our attitudes.
- [04:14] Our cognition -- that is, our thoughts, perspectives, and expectations -- is important for learning,
- [04:19] as is our social context, as Bandura figured out.
- [04:22] So, Pavlov-style conditioning experiments that ignore those social-cognitive elements
- [04:26] can really run into trouble.
- [04:27] For example, someone under treatment for an alcohol addiction may be given booze laced
- [04:31] with a nauseating drug.
- [04:33] According to the pure classical conditioning model, that person would then equate booze
- [04:37] with feeling nasty.
- [04:38] But the brain can override this association if it’s aware that it’s the added drug,
- [04:42] and not the alcohol, is the thing that’s causing the illness.
- [04:45] Sometimes we can think our way out of intended associations.
- [04:48] And by the same token, a person’s social context - like, their friends, family traditions,
- [04:53] or life stressors - can reinforce something like alcohol consumption more than the nauseating
- [04:58] pill could ever punish it.
- [04:59] Plus, we also do a lot of latent learning, like without even knowing it.
- [05:02] Have you ever been walking around a new city, someone stops you to ask directions, and you
- [05:06] surprise yourself by actually being able to tell that tourist how to get to the park?
- [05:10] That’s because we’re constantly developing cognitive maps, or mental representations
- [05:14] of our surroundings, without explicitly telling ourselves to do it.
- [05:16] We’ve all seen the experiments with in mazes: Well, those show us that even rats develop
- [05:21] these cognitive maps, figuring out how to get around, even if there’s no reward at
- [05:25] the end.
- [05:26] And days later, when they finally do get food at the end of the maze, they quickly demonstrate
- [05:30] all that earlier latent learning by scuttling through the maze as fast, or faster, than
- [05:35] rats that had been rewarded all along.
- [05:37] So, learning isn’t just about associating a response with a consequence.
- [05:41] There’s thinking happening, too.
- [05:42] And this kind of thinking is also a big part of observational learning, which is basically
- [05:46] learning by watching other people, or being influenced by them in other ways.

- [06:32] Which brings us back to Bobo.

### Transcript (reading)

Clive Wearing was playing the piano alone in his room. When his wife came into the room, he immediately leapt up and embraced her with joyful enthusiasm. A minute later, she slipped out to grab a glass of water, and when she returned, he gave her that same bright greeting, as if she’d been gone for days. And then he did again. And again. Clive was an accomplished London musician, until, in 1985 at the age 47, he contracted a rare Herpes encephalitis virus that ravaged his central nervous system. Since then he’s been unable to remember almost any of his past, or to make any new memories. His wife is the only person he recognizes, but he can never recall the last time he saw her.

This may be the most profound case of extreme and chronic amnesia ever recorded. Our memory helps make us who we are. Whether recognizing loved ones, recalling past joys, or just remembering how to, like, walk and talk and fry an egg, memory is the chain that connects our past to our present. If it breaks, we’re left untethered, incapable of leaving the present moment, and unable to embrace the future. But memory isn’t an all or nothing thing, of course. Wearing can’t remember any details about his personal past, but he still remembers how to speak English, get dressed, and play the piano. Some memories you process automatically, and they are stored differently than your more personal or factual memories, like, your first kiss, or how to recite pi to twelve places,

or who won the Peloponnesian War. Speaking of ancient Greeks -- and to help demonstrate what I’m talking about -- I want you to have a look at our Spartan friend here, and remember his name. ‘Cause we’re gonna test your memory in just minute. [INTRO] Technically, memory is learning that has persisted over time -- information that has been stored and, in many cases, can be recalled. Except of course during the exam! Our memories are typically accessed in three different ways — through recall, recognition, and relearning. And if you think about all the different kinds of tests you’ve taken in school, they’re all actually designed to size up how you access stored information in these ways.

Like, recall is how you reach back in your mind and bring up information, just as you do in fill-in-the-blank tests. So if i say, BLANK is the capital of Greece, your brain would hopefully recall the answer as Athens. Recognition, meanwhile, is more like a multiple-choice test -- you only need identify old information when presented with it. As in: which of the following was NOT an ancient city in Greece: Athens, Marathon, Pompeii, or Sparta. And relearning is sort of like refreshing or reinforcing old information. So when you study for a final exam, you relearn things you half-forgot more easily than you did when you were first learning them, like, say, a basic timeline of the Greek empire.

But how? How does all of that data that we’re exposed to, all the time, every day, become memory? Well, in the late 1960s, American psychologists Richard Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin figured out enough about the process of memory-formation to break it down into three stages: First, it’s first encoded into brain, then stored for future use, and then eventually retrieved. Sounds simple, but by now you’ve figured out that, just because you take a lot of stuff about your mind for granted, that doesn’t mean it isn’t complicated. By Atkinson and Shiffrin’s model, we first record things we want to remember as an immediate, but fleeting, sensory memory. Think back to the image I showed you a minute ago.

Do you remember his name? If you do it’s because you successfully managed to shuffle it into your short-term memory, where you probably encoded it through rehearsal. This is how you briefly remember something like a password or phone number-- hey Tommy, what’s Jenny’s number? Okay. 867-5309...867-5309… 8-6-7-5-3… see you’re getting it in your head there. Or in this case, I told you to remember that guy’s name, so maybe you were thinking “Leonidas” repeatedly over and over, even if you didn’t think you were doing it. But this information really only stays in your short-term memory for under thirty seconds without a lot of rehearsal. So if you weren’t repeating “Leonidas,” you’d probably have forgotten it already.

Because your mind, amazing as it is, can really only hold between four to seven distinct bits of information at a time--at which point, the memory either decays, or gets transferred into long-term memory. Long-term memory is like your brain’s durable and ridiculously spacious storage unit, holding all your knowledge, skills, and experiences. Now, since the days of Atkinson and Shiffrin, psychologists have recognized that the classical definition of short-term memory didn’t really capture all of the processes involved in the transfer of information to your long-term memory. I mean, it’s more than just being able to remember some Greek guy’s name. So later generations of psychologists revisited the whole idea of short-term memory and updated

it to the more comprehensive concept of working memory. Working memory involves all the ways that we take short-term information and stash it in our long-term stores. And increasingly, we think of it as involving both explicit and implicit processes. When we store information consciously and actively, that’s an explicit process. We make the most of this aspect of working memory when we study, for instance, so that we can know that Athens is the capital of Greece, and that Pompeii was a Roman town, and not a Greek one. This is how we capture facts and knowledge that we think we’re going to need -- like I told you specifically to remember Leonidas’ name, you concentrated on that detail and filed it away, if briefly.

But of course we’re not conscious of Every. Tiny. Thing that we take in. Yet, our working memory often transfers stuff we’re not aware of to long-term storage. We call that an implicit process, the kind you don’t have to actively concentrate on. A good example might be classically conditioned associations, like, if you get all sweaty and nervous at the dentist because you had a root canal last year. You don’t need to pull up that file on the last time you got your face drilled to think oh hey, oral surgery! Not my favorite! Instead, implicit processes cover all that stuff automatically. This kind of automatic processing is hard to shut off-- unless you’ve got something unusual going on in your brain, you may not have much choice but to learn this way, like

how you learned how to not put your hand into a fire. That learning would have happened pretty much automatically as soon as you first yanked your hand away from an open flame. Whether things are lodged in there explicitly or implicitly, or both, there are also different kinds of long-term memory. For instance, procedural memory refers to how we remember to do things -- like riding a bike or reading - it’s effortful to learn at first, but eventually you can do it without thinking about it. Long-term memory can also be episodic, tied to specific episodes of your life -- like “remember that time that Bernice fell out of her chair in chemistry lab and started laughing uncontrollably?” Man, good times.

There are other types of long-term memory, too, and we’re continually learning more about the biology and psychology of the whole complex phenomenon. For instance, while Clive Wearing’s episodic memories (among others) seem to be deeply affected, his procedural memories for things seems to be in one piece. This has to do with neuroanatomy that we don’t have time to explore here, and that we don’t yet fully understand -- Wearing and others have a lot to teach us about the different types of long-term memory storage. Now, for healthy memories, there are lots of little tricks you can use to help remember information. Mnemonics, for one, help with memorization, and I’m sure you know a few that take the form of acronyms--ROY G. BIV for the colors of the rainbow, for instance.

Mnemonics work in part by organizing items into familiar, manageable units, in a process called chunking. For example, it may be hard to recall a seven-digit number, but it’ll be easier to commit it to memory in the rhythm of a phone number: 867-5309. Or you could just, you know, write a song about it. Strategies like mnemonics and chunking can help you with explicit processing, but how well you retain your data can depend on how deep you dig through the different levels of processing. Shallow processing, for instance, lets you encode information on really basic auditory or visual levels, based on the sound, structure or appearance of a word. So if you’re trying to commit the name Leonidas to your explicit memory, using shallow processing

you might encode the word by recalling the cool font you saw it in. But to really retain that information, you’d want to activate your deep processing, which encodes semantically, based on actual meaning associated with the word. In this case, you might remember the story of the mega-tough yet very scantily clad warrior of ancient Greece. Or you might remember that “leon” means “lion” in Greek, that lions are tough fighters, and that Leonidas was a tough Spartan warrior-king. And then to really, really make it stick, you want to connect it to something meaningful or related to your own personal, emotional experience. Like maybe Gerard Butler’s bronzed eight-pack torso and unconquerable blood-lust helped lock down the words Spartan and Leonidas in your forever memory.

I mean, maybe. If … if that helps you. In the end, how much information you encode and remember depends on both the time you took to learn it and how you made it personally relevant to YOU. Memory is extremely powerful. It’s constantly shaping and reshaping your brain, your life, and your identity. Clive Wearing is still himself on the outside, but in his inability to recall who he was, or process what has happened, he has lost some critically important part of himself. Our memories may haunt us or sustain us, but either way, they define us. Without them, we are left to wander alone in the dark. If you were committing this lesson to memory, you learned about how we encode and store memory, the difference between implicit automatic and effortful explicit processing, how shallow

and deep processing work, and a few types of long-term storage. Thanks for watching, especially to our Subbable subscribers, who make this whole channel possible.

- [00:53] walk and talk and fry an egg, memory is the chain that connects our past to our present.
- [00:58] If it breaks, we’re left untethered, incapable of leaving the present moment, and unable
- [01:04] to embrace the future.
- [01:05] But memory isn’t an all or nothing thing, of course.
- [01:09] Wearing can’t remember any details about his personal past, but he still remembers
- [01:12] how to speak English, get dressed, and play the piano.
- [01:15] Some memories you process automatically, and they are stored differently than your more
- [01:19] personal or factual memories, like, your first kiss, or how to recite pi to twelve places,
- [01:23] or who won the Peloponnesian War.
- [01:25] Speaking of ancient Greeks -- and to help demonstrate what I’m talking about -- I
- [01:28] want you to have a look at our Spartan friend here, and remember his name.
- [01:32] ‘Cause we’re gonna test your memory in just minute.
- [01:38] [INTRO]
- [01:42] Technically, memory is learning that has persisted over time -- information that has been stored
- [01:50] and, in many cases, can be recalled.
- [01:52] Except of course during the exam!
- [01:54] Our memories are typically accessed in three different ways — through recall, recognition,
- [01:59] and relearning.
- [02:00] And if you think about all the different kinds of tests you’ve taken in school, they’re
- [02:04] all actually designed to size up how you access stored information in these ways.
- [02:08] Like, recall is how you reach back in your mind and bring up information, just as you
- [02:13] do in fill-in-the-blank tests.
- [02:14] So if i say, BLANK is the capital of Greece, your brain would hopefully recall the answer
- [02:19] as Athens.
- [02:20] Recognition, meanwhile, is more like a multiple-choice test -- you only need identify old information
- [02:25] when presented with it.
- [02:27] As in: which of the following was NOT an ancient city in Greece: Athens, Marathon, Pompeii,
- [02:33] or Sparta.
- [02:34] And relearning is sort of like refreshing or reinforcing old information.
- [02:38] So when you study for a final exam, you relearn things you half-forgot more easily than you
- [02:43] did when you were first learning them, like, say, a basic timeline of the Greek empire.
- [02:48] But how?
- [02:49] How does all of that data that we’re exposed to, all the time, every day, become memory?
- [02:54] Well, in the late 1960s, American psychologists Richard Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin figured
- [02:59] out enough about the process of memory-formation to break it down into three stages:
- [03:03] First, it’s first encoded into brain, then stored for future use, and then eventually
- [03:07] retrieved.
- [03:09] Sounds simple, but by now you’ve figured out that, just because you take a lot of stuff
- [03:12] about your mind for granted, that doesn’t mean it isn’t complicated.
- [03:15] By Atkinson and Shiffrin’s model, we first record things we want to remember as an immediate,
- [03:20] but fleeting, sensory memory.
- [03:23] Think back to the image I showed you a minute ago.
- [03:24] Do you remember his name?
- [03:25] If you do it’s because you successfully managed to shuffle it into your short-term
- [03:30] memory, where you probably encoded it through rehearsal.
- [03:33] This is how you briefly remember something like a password or phone number-- hey Tommy,
- [03:37] what’s Jenny’s number?
- [03:38] Okay.
- [03:39] 867-5309...867-5309… 8-6-7-5-3… see you’re getting it in your head there.
- [03:47] Or in this case, I told you to remember that guy’s name, so maybe you were thinking “Leonidas”
- [03:52] repeatedly over and over, even if you didn’t think you were doing it.
- [03:54] But this information really only stays in your short-term memory for under thirty seconds
- [03:58] without a lot of rehearsal.
- [04:00] So if you weren’t repeating “Leonidas,” you’d probably have
- [04:03] forgotten it already.
- [04:04] Because your mind, amazing as it is, can really only hold between four to seven distinct bits
- [04:09] of information at a time--at which point, the memory either decays, or gets transferred
- [04:14] into long-term memory.
- [04:16] Long-term memory is like your brain’s durable and ridiculously spacious storage unit, holding
- [04:21] all your knowledge, skills, and experiences.
- [04:24] Now, since the days of Atkinson and Shiffrin, psychologists have recognized that the classical
- [04:28] definition of short-term memory didn’t really capture all of the processes involved in the
- [04:33] transfer of information to your long-term memory.
- [04:35] I mean, it’s more than just being able to remember some Greek guy’s name.
- [04:38] So later generations of psychologists revisited the whole idea of short-term memory and updated
- [04:43] it to the more comprehensive concept of working memory.
- [04:46] Working memory involves all the ways that we take short-term information and stash it
- [04:51] in our long-term stores.
- [04:52] And increasingly, we think of it as involving both explicit and implicit processes.
- [04:56] When we store information consciously and actively, that’s an explicit process.
- [05:01] We make the most of this aspect of working memory when we study, for instance, so that
- [05:05] we can know that Athens is the capital of Greece, and that Pompeii was a Roman town,
- [05:08] and not a Greek one.
- [05:09] This is how we capture facts and knowledge that we think we’re going to need -- like
- [05:13] I told you specifically to remember Leonidas’ name, you concentrated on that detail and
- [05:18] filed it away, if briefly.
- [05:20] But of course we’re not conscious of Every.
- [05:21] Tiny.
- [05:22] Thing that we take in.
- [05:23] Yet, our working memory often transfers stuff we’re not aware of to long-term storage.
- [05:29] We call that an implicit process, the kind you don’t have to actively concentrate on.
- [05:33] A good example might be classically conditioned associations, like, if you get all sweaty
- [05:37] and nervous at the dentist because you had a root canal last year.
- [05:39] You don’t need to pull up that file on the last time you got your face drilled to think
- [05:44] oh hey, oral surgery!
- [05:45] Not my favorite!
- [05:47] Instead, implicit processes cover all that stuff automatically.
- [05:49] This kind of automatic processing is hard to shut off-- unless you’ve got something
- [05:53] unusual going on in your brain, you may not have much choice but to learn this way, like
- [05:58] how you learned how to not put your hand into a fire.
- [06:01] That learning would have happened pretty much automatically as soon as you first yanked
- [06:04] your hand away from an open flame.
- [06:05] Whether things are lodged in there explicitly or implicitly, or both, there are also different
- [06:10] kinds of long-term memory.
- [06:12] For instance, procedural memory refers to how we remember to do things -- like riding
- [06:16] a bike or reading - it’s effortful to learn at first, but eventually you can do it without
- [06:21] thinking about it.
- [06:22] Long-term memory can also be episodic, tied to specific episodes of your life -- like
- [06:27] “remember that time that Bernice fell out of her chair in chemistry lab and started
- [06:30] laughing uncontrollably?”
- [06:31] Man, good times.
- [06:32] There are other types of long-term memory, too, and we’re continually learning more
- [06:36] about the biology and psychology of the whole complex phenomenon.
- [06:40] For instance, while Clive Wearing’s episodic memories (among others) seem to be deeply
- [06:45] affected, his procedural memories for things seems to be in one piece.
- [06:49] This has to do with neuroanatomy that we don’t have time to explore here, and that we don’t
- [06:53] yet fully understand -- Wearing and others have a lot to teach us about the different
- [06:57] types of long-term memory storage.
- [06:59] Now, for healthy memories, there are lots of little tricks you can use to help remember
- [07:02] information.
- [07:03] Mnemonics, for one, help with memorization, and I’m sure you know a few that take the
- [07:07] form of acronyms--ROY G. BIV for the colors of the rainbow, for instance.
- [07:11] Mnemonics work in part by organizing items into familiar, manageable units, in a process
- [07:16] called chunking.
- [07:17] For example, it may be hard to recall a seven-digit number, but it’ll be easier to commit it
- [07:22] to memory in the rhythm of a phone number: 867-5309.
- [07:24] Or you could just, you know, write a song about it.
- [07:28] Strategies like mnemonics and chunking can help you with explicit processing, but how
- [07:32] well you retain your data can depend on how deep you dig through the different levels
- [07:37] of processing.
- [07:38] Shallow processing, for instance, lets you encode information on really basic auditory
- [07:42] or visual levels, based on the sound, structure or appearance of a word.
- [07:46] So if you’re trying to commit the name Leonidas to your explicit memory, using shallow processing
- [07:51] you might encode the word by recalling the cool font you saw it in.
- [07:54] But to really retain that information, you’d want to activate your deep processing, which
- [07:59] encodes semantically, based on actual meaning associated with the word.
- [08:04] In this case, you might remember the story of the mega-tough yet very scantily clad warrior
- [08:09] of ancient Greece.
- [08:10] Or you might remember that “leon” means “lion” in Greek, that lions are tough
- [08:14] fighters, and that Leonidas was a tough Spartan warrior-king.
- [08:18] And then to really, really make it stick, you want to connect it to something meaningful
- [08:21] or related to your own personal, emotional experience.
- [08:24] Like maybe Gerard Butler’s bronzed eight-pack torso and unconquerable blood-lust helped
- [08:28] lock down the words Spartan and Leonidas in your forever memory.
- [08:32] I mean, maybe.
- [08:33] If … if that helps you.
- [08:34] In the end, how much information you encode and remember depends on both the time you
- [08:38] took to learn it and how you made it personally relevant to YOU.
- [08:42] Memory is extremely powerful.
- [08:44] It’s constantly shaping and reshaping your brain, your life, and your identity.
- [08:49] Clive Wearing is still himself on the outside, but in his inability to recall who he was,
- [08:53] or process what has happened, he has lost some critically important part of himself.
- [08:59] Our memories may haunt us or sustain us, but either way, they define us.
- [09:03] Without them, we are left to wander alone in the dark.
- [09:07] If you were committing this lesson to memory, you learned about how we encode and store
- [09:11] memory, the difference between implicit automatic and effortful explicit processing, how shallow
- [09:16] and deep processing work, and a few types of long-term storage.

### Transcript (reading)

It was midnight when Bernice got off work. She was exhausted after a long and terrible day, and just wanted to get home to a hot bath. She was driving down the street, flipping through radio stations, when she pulled up to a stop sign, and saw something weird. A shadowy figure ran up to an idling fruit truck, pushed the delivery man down, grabbed a crate of bananas, and ran off around the corner. Bernice was pretty shaken up, but she made sure the driver was okay, and then called the police, describing the thief as a pale, lanky man, wearing a dark jacket and a baseball cap. She gave the cops her information, and then she went home. A couple days later the police asked her to come down to the station to identify a potential

thief--a guy who more or less matched her description, and was found eating a banana early that morning, near the scene of the crime. Although the guy professed innocence, Bernice said it was him, and they locked him up. But at the trial, the defense called a memory expert to the stand, and soon after that, the suspect walked. Today’s lesson may not quite make you an expert worthy of the witness stand, but by the time we’re done, you’ll understand a lot more about how we retrieve memories we think we’ve stored, and why the accused banana thief was set free. [INTRO] We’re all constantly retrieving memories throughout the day-- you’re remembering where you parked your car, or if you fed the cat, or called your mom ‘cause it’s her birthday.

You’ll remember from last week that while our implicit memories--like how to talk and ride a bike--are dealt with on a mostly automatic and non-conscious level, our explicit memories--the chronicles of our personal experiences and general knowledge -- often require conscious, effortful work. Bernice had to notice, encode, store, and later consciously retrieve details about the crime she witnessed--what color was the guy’s jacket, what did he look like, what did he steal, and where did he run? It takes a lot of work to retrieve memories from long-term storage, and the truth is, a lot can go wrong along the way. In order to understand all of the many fascinating ways you forget things, we need to talk more about how we remember.

Our memories are not like books in the library of your mind. You don’t just pluck a neatly-packaged memory -- about where you left your phone or the hair color of a fruit thief. Instead your memories are more like the spider webs in the dank catacombs of your mind--a series of interconnected associations that link all sorts of diverse things, as bits of information get stuck to other bits of information. Like, maybe Bernice remembers that the night of the crime was chilly with a full moon, and that Beyonce was on the radio, and the fruit truck had plates from California, which is where her grandfather lives. All those bits of information in the web of memory--the weather, the song, the plates--can serve as retrieval cues, kind of like a trail of breadcrumbs leading back to a particular

memory. The more retrieval cues you inadvertently, or intentionally, build along the way, the better you can backtrack and find the memory you’re looking for. This way of activating associations non-consciously is called priming, sometimes called “memoryless memory”. It’s how “invisible memories” that you didn’t know you had can awaken old associations. Priming is how you often jog your memory. This kind of recall is sometimes referred to as context-dependent memory. Say you’re reading in bed, and you want to underline a quote, but you don’t have a pen. You get up and go into the other room to find your special light-up Hello Kitty pen, but you get distracted and suddenly you find yourself in the kitchen; you’re like “Why?

Why, mind? Why am I in the kitchen? What is here? Why am- there was a rea- and I don’t know but I’m here now and agh!” It’s only when you retrace your steps and return to bed, to the initial context where you read that quote and encoded that first thought of wanting that pen, that the memory comes back. And then you’re like ‘oh, I need to go get the pen. Ugh’ If some memories are context-dependent, others are state-dependent, and also mood-congruent. This just means that our states and our emotions can also serve as retrieval cues. If I had a throbbing headache and a super bad day, I’m more likely to start recalling bad memories, because I’m priming negative associations.

But of course if I’m relaxed and jolly, I’m prone to remember happy times, which are prolonging my good mood. Another funny memory-retrieval quirk speaks not to our location or emotions, but to the order in which we receive new information. So, say you make a grocery list in the morning, but a few hours later, you’re at the store, you realize you left it at home. You’d be more likely to recall the first items on the list--bananas and bread--and the last items--pickles and cheese--than anything in the middle. This is known as the serial position effect. This might be because the early words benefitted from what’s known as the primacy effect, and made it into your long-term memory because they were rehearsed more.

Meanwhile, the last words lingered in the working memory through the recency effect. But those poor middle words, they didn’t benefit from either effect and therefore escaped your brain, which is why you now have no toilet paper, dog food, toothpaste, or cookies. Who forgets cookies? But even with all these tricks and associations, things still go wrong--memory can fail or become distorted, and of course we forget things. Forgetfulness can be as minor as those frustrating moments where you’re like ‘Ah, it’s on the tip of my tongue. It’s the guy, the guy’s got hair, and a face, and, like, shoulders.’ Or as major as Clive Wearing, whose neurological damage made it impossible for him to recall the past or create new memories.

Of course, we all forget things, and typically we do it in one of three different ways: We fail to encode it, we fail to retrieve it, or we experience what psychologists call storage decay. Sometimes forgetting something just means it never really got through your encoding process in the first place. I mean, think of all the stuff that’s going around you at any given moment. We only actually notice a fraction of what we sense, and we can only consciously hold so many bits of information in our minds at any given time, so what we fail to notice, we tend to not encode, and thus don't remember. Bernice noticed a dark jacket, Beyonce, and bananas, but she didn’t encode much about the driver, or the color of the thief’s shoes.

Then again, even memories that have been encoded are still vulnerable to storage decay, or natural forgetting over time. Interestingly, even though we can forget things pretty quickly, the amount of data that we forget can actually levels off after a while. This means that Bernice would have forgotten about half of what she first noticed from the crime scene a couple days later, but what she still remembered, she’d likely hang on to, because the rate at which we forget tends to plateau. A lot of times forgetting doesn’t mean our memory just faded to black, it means we can’t call it up on demand because of retrieval failure. We all know the common tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon where you feel like you know the name of that weird-looking hard-backed animal that rolls up into ball.

It’s kind of cute and weird and I think they get leprosy or something…what is it?! This is where retrieval cues can come in handy. If I say is starts with the letter A, you may suddenly unlock the information--Armadillo! Sometimes these retrieval problems stem from interference from other memories getting in the way, essentially cluttering the brain. Sometimes, old stuff that you’ve learned keeps you from recalling new stuff -- like, if you change one of your passwords, but keep recalling your old one every time you try to log in. That’s called proactive, or forward-acting, interference. The flip side is retroactive, or backward-acting, interference, which happens when new learning gets in the way of recalling old information, like if you start studying Spanish, it may

interfere with the French that you’ve already learned. There’s a lot of reconstruction and inferring involved when you try to flesh out a memory, and every time you replay it in your mind, or relate it to a friend, it changes, just a little. So in a way, we’re all sort of perpetually re-writing our pasts. While this is an inevitable part of human nature, it can prove dangerous at times. Misleading information can get incorporated into a memory, and twist the truth - and yes there is an effect for this; it’s called the misinformation effect. American psychologist and memory expert Elizabeth Loftus has spent decades showing how eyewitnesses inadvertently tweak and reconstruct their memories after accidents or crimes.

In one experiment, two groups watched a film of a car accident. Those asked how fast the cars were going when they smashed into each other estimated much higher speeds than those who were asked about the cars hitting each other. Smash is the leading word that essentially altered the witnesses’ memories -- so much so that a week later, when both groups were asked if they saw any broken glass, those who heard the word smash were twice as likely to report seeing bits of glass, when in fact, the original film didn’t show any. In Bernice’s case, chances are her memory of the robbery would be altered if the prosecution said the thief assaulted, rather than pushed the driver. This sort of interfering or misleading information may also manifest itself as source misattribution,

like when we forget or misrecall the source of a memory. In the case of Bernice, when she saw the suspect in the courtroom, she thought she recognized him from the night of the crime, when in reality, he’d just served her coffee earlier that day. But her memory of the event had probably already been tweaked several times before she even made it into the courtroom. Like she re-lived the tale multiple times, in her own mind or when she told other people about it, and every time she introduced errors, filling in memory gaps with reasonable guesses. Not only that, but we know Bernice was already tired and stressed when she witnessed the event, and we know our emotions can influence both what we remember and what we forget.

Because memory is both a reconstruction and a reproduction of past events, we can’t ever really be sure if a memory is real just because it feels real. Elizabeth Loftus knows this. She’s frequently called in to testify against the accuracy of eyewitnesses. In fact, of all the U.S. prisoners who have been exonerated based on DNA evidence presented by Innocence Project, a non-profit legal group, 75 percent of them were convicted by mistaken eyewitnesses. That is a lot of innocent people. Bernice meant well of course, she’s an honest enough lady, but all these factors--the emotion, the retelling, the suggestions of outside sources-- combined with the darkness, the quick glimpse, the passing of time, maybe even the Beyonce, ended up leading to a mistake in the thief’s identification.

Turns out the human memory is actually a very fragile thing. We’re all largely the product of the stories that we tell ourselves. If you haven’t forgotten already, today you learned about how our memories are stored in webs of association, aided by retrieval cues and priming, and influenced by context and mood. You also learned how we forget information, how our memories are susceptible to interference and misinformation, and why eyewitnesses are often not as reliable as you might think.

- [03:19] It’s only when you retrace your steps and return to bed, to the initial context where
- [03:23] you read that quote and encoded that first thought of wanting that pen, that the memory
- [03:27] comes back.
- [03:28] And then you’re like ‘oh, I need to go get the pen.
- [03:31] Ugh’ If some memories are context-dependent, others
- [03:34] are state-dependent, and also mood-congruent.
- [03:37] This just means that our states and our emotions can also serve as retrieval cues.
- [03:40] If I had a throbbing headache and a super bad day, I’m more likely to start recalling
- [03:44] bad memories, because I’m priming negative associations.
- [03:48] But of course if I’m relaxed and jolly, I’m prone to remember happy times, which
- [03:51] are prolonging my good mood.
- [03:53] Another funny memory-retrieval quirk speaks not to our location or emotions, but to the
- [03:57] order in which we receive new information.
- [04:00] So, say you make a grocery list in the morning, but a few hours later, you’re at the store,
- [04:03] you realize you left it at home.
- [04:05] You’d be more likely to recall the first items on the list--bananas and bread--and
- [04:08] the last items--pickles and cheese--than anything in the middle.
- [04:11] This is known as the serial position effect.
- [04:14] This might be because the early words benefitted from what’s known as the primacy effect,
- [04:17] and made it into your long-term memory because they were rehearsed more.
- [04:21] Meanwhile, the last words lingered in the working memory through the recency effect.
- [04:25] But those poor middle words, they didn’t benefit from either effect and therefore escaped
- [04:29] your brain, which is why you now have no toilet paper, dog food, toothpaste, or cookies.
- [04:34] Who forgets cookies?
- [04:35] But even with all these tricks and associations, things still go wrong--memory can fail or
- [04:41] become distorted, and of course we forget things.
- [04:44] Forgetfulness can be as minor as those frustrating moments where you’re like ‘Ah, it’s
- [04:47] on the tip of my tongue.
- [04:48] It’s the guy, the guy’s got hair, and a face, and, like, shoulders.’
- [04:52] Or as major as Clive Wearing, whose neurological damage made it impossible for him to recall
- [04:56] the past or create new memories.
- [04:58] Of course, we all forget things, and typically we do it in one of three different ways: We
- [05:03] fail to encode it, we fail to retrieve it, or we experience what psychologists call storage
- [05:08] decay.
- [05:09] Sometimes forgetting something just means it never really got through your encoding
- [05:12] process in the first place.
- [05:13] I mean, think of all the stuff that’s going around you at any given moment.
- [05:17] We only actually notice a fraction of what we sense, and we can only consciously hold
- [05:21] so many bits of information in our minds at any given time, so what we fail to notice,
- [05:25] we tend to not encode, and thus don't remember.
- [05:28] Bernice noticed a dark jacket, Beyonce, and bananas, but she didn’t encode much about
- [05:33] the driver, or the color of the thief’s shoes.
- [05:35] Then again, even memories that have been encoded are still vulnerable to storage decay, or
- [05:39] natural forgetting over time.
- [05:41] Interestingly, even though we can forget things pretty quickly, the amount of data that we
- [05:45] forget can actually levels off after a while.
- [05:47] This means that Bernice would have forgotten about half of what she first noticed from
- [05:50] the crime scene a couple days later, but what she still remembered, she’d likely hang
- [05:54] on to, because the rate at which we forget tends to plateau.
- [05:57] A lot of times forgetting doesn’t mean our memory just faded to black, it means we can’t
- [06:01] call it up on demand because of retrieval failure.
- [06:04] We all know the common tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon where you feel like you know the name of that
- [06:08] weird-looking hard-backed animal that rolls up into ball.
- [06:12] It’s kind of cute and weird and I think they get leprosy or something…what is it?!
- [06:16] This is where retrieval cues can come in handy.
- [06:18] If I say is starts with the letter A, you may suddenly unlock the information--Armadillo!
- [06:22] Sometimes these retrieval problems stem from interference from other memories getting in
- [06:26] the way, essentially cluttering the brain.
- [06:28] Sometimes, old stuff that you’ve learned keeps you from recalling new stuff -- like,
- [06:31] if you change one of your passwords, but keep recalling your old one every time you try
- [06:35] to log in.
- [06:36] That’s called proactive, or forward-acting, interference.
- [06:38] The flip side is retroactive, or backward-acting, interference, which happens when new learning
- [06:43] gets in the way of recalling old information, like if you start studying Spanish, it may
- [06:47] interfere with the French that you’ve already learned.
- [06:49] There’s a lot of reconstruction and inferring involved when you try to flesh out a memory,
- [06:54] and every time you replay it in your mind, or relate it to a friend, it changes, just
- [06:58] a little.
- [06:59] So in a way, we’re all sort of perpetually re-writing our pasts.
- [07:03] While this is an inevitable part of human nature, it can prove dangerous at times.
- [07:08] Misleading information can get incorporated into a memory, and twist the truth - and yes
- [07:11] there is an effect for this; it’s called the misinformation effect.
- [07:14] American psychologist and memory expert Elizabeth Loftus has spent decades showing how eyewitnesses
- [07:19] inadvertently tweak and reconstruct their memories after accidents or crimes.
- [07:23] In one experiment, two groups watched a film of a car accident.
- [07:26] Those asked how fast the cars were going when they smashed into each other estimated much
- [07:30] higher speeds than those who were asked about the cars hitting each other.
- [07:35] Smash is the leading word that essentially altered the witnesses’ memories -- so much
- [07:39] so that a week later, when both groups were asked if they saw any broken glass, those
- [07:44] who heard the word smash were twice as likely to report seeing bits of glass, when in fact,
- [07:49] the original film didn’t show any.
- [07:50] In Bernice’s case, chances are her memory of the robbery would be altered if the prosecution
- [07:54] said the thief assaulted, rather than pushed the driver.
- [07:57] This sort of interfering or misleading information may also manifest itself as source misattribution,
- [08:02] like when we forget or misrecall the source of a memory.
- [08:05] In the case of Bernice, when she saw the suspect in the courtroom, she thought she recognized
- [08:09] him from the night of the crime, when in reality, he’d just served her coffee earlier that
- [08:13] day.
- [08:14] But her memory of the event had probably already been tweaked several times before she even
- [08:17] made it into the courtroom.
- [08:19] Like she re-lived the tale multiple times, in her own mind or when she told other people
- [08:23] about it, and every time she introduced errors, filling in memory gaps with reasonable guesses.
- [08:28] Not only that, but we know Bernice was already tired and stressed when she witnessed the
- [08:32] event, and we know our emotions can influence both what we remember and what we forget.
- [08:37] Because memory is both a reconstruction and a reproduction of past events, we can’t
- [08:41] ever really be sure if a memory is real just because it feels real.
- [08:45] Elizabeth Loftus knows this.
- [08:47] She’s frequently called in to testify against the accuracy of eyewitnesses.
- [08:50] In fact, of all the U.S. prisoners who have been exonerated based on DNA evidence presented
- [08:55] by Innocence Project, a non-profit legal group, 75 percent of them were convicted by mistaken
- [09:00] eyewitnesses.
- [09:01] That is a lot of innocent people.
- [09:03] Bernice meant well of course, she’s an honest enough lady, but all these factors--the emotion,
- [09:07] the retelling, the suggestions of outside sources-- combined with the darkness, the
- [09:11] quick glimpse, the passing of time, maybe even the Beyonce, ended up leading to a mistake
- [09:16] in the thief’s identification.
- [09:18] Turns out the human memory is actually a very fragile thing.
- [09:21] We’re all largely the product of the stories that we tell ourselves.
- [09:25] If you haven’t forgotten already, today you learned about how our memories are stored
- [09:29] in webs of association, aided by retrieval cues and priming, and influenced by context
- [09:34] and mood.
- [09:35] You also learned how we forget information, how our memories are susceptible to interference
- [09:40] and misinformation, and why eyewitnesses are often not as reliable as you might think.

### Transcript (reading)

Why do smart people make dumb decisions? Why do conspiracy theorists think that we didn’t land on the moon or that Hillary Clinton is a space alien? And why won’t Bernice admit that the new Superman movie just isn’t very good? We’ve talked about cognition before. We usually refer to it as the process that we use to think and solve crossword puzzles and stuff. But really, cognition involves knowing, remembering, understanding, communicating, and to a certain extent, learning. And as truly wonderful as our brains are, we can be spectacularly bad at ALL of these things. We used to think our cognition worked like a computer -- logically processing information. But that cabbage-sized chunk of pink, wet brain matter in your skull can do a lot more

than math, and the things that it does are certainly not always logical. Many experts argue that it’s cognition that makes us truly human, and that everything that comes with it -- our preferences, prejudices, fears, and intuitions -- are what make us the individuals that we are. We’re not the only animals that show some evidence of cognition, of course: Chimps and gorillas exhibit insight and planning; crows use tools; elephants teach each other. But our capacity as humans to figure stuff out is matched only by our ability to totally misjudge stuff. As prone as we are to brilliance and insight, we’re equally likely to succumb to irrational thinking and false intuition. So, to borrow a riff from Rene Descartes, you think, therefore you are.

Which means you’re brilliant a lot of the time. And sometimes, you’re just going to look stupid. [INTRO] We all want to make sense of the world. And one of the major ways our cognition allows us do that is by forming concepts -- mental groupings of similar objects, people, ideas, or events. We like to lump things together. Concepts simplify our thinking in such a fundamental way that we usually don’t have to stop and think about using them, they’re just there. And yet without concepts, we’d need a unique name for everything. You couldn’t just ask me to shake the anglerfish -- because there’d be no concept of shake or fish, let alone stuffed, blue anglerfish. And if I told you I was devastated that I lost my anglerfish -- which I probably would

be -- I’d also have to explain my emotions, their intensities, even the words themselves that I had to use. So basically, without concepts, no one would ever get anything done. We’d all be like a bunch of ents taking all morning to say “Hey, what’s up?” We often organize our concepts by forming prototypes--mental images or pinnacle examples of a certain thing. For example, if I say “bird”--the general shape of a songbird probably pops into your head before like, a penguin or chicken or emu, because robins and cardinals more closely resemble our bird prototype. Still, if I show you a picture of some crazy creature you’ve never seen before, and you note that it has feathers and a beak, you’ll probably file it under the bird category because

it more closely resembles your concept of bird than your concept of rodent or overcoat or footstool. Concepts and prototypes speed up our thinking, but they also can box in our thinking, and lead to prejudice if we see something that doesn’t fit our prototypes. A hundred years ago the sight of a female doctor might have caused some heads to explode, because in peoples’ tiny minds, the prototypes of “doctor” and “woman” didn’t have any overlap. And actually some people today still feel that way. Haters gonna hate. So it’s important to actively keep your mind open mind to make room for evolving concepts, and remember that concepts may sometimes hurt as much as they help. One of the biggest ways our cognition works to our benefit, though, is through our ability to solve problems.

We use our problem-solving skills all the time: How to assemble Scandinavian furniture, bake muffins with a missing ingredient, or handle the crushing disappointment of the new Superman movie. And we approach problem-solving in different ways -- sometimes we value speed; other times, accuracy. Some problems we figure out using trial and error--you know, you try something and if it doesn’t work, try it a different way, and keep at it until something works. Trial and error is slow and deliberate--which may be good or bad, depending on the problem. We can also use algorithms and heuristics to come up with solutions. Algorithms are logical, methodical, step-by-step procedures that guarantee an eventual solution, though they may be slow to work through.

Heuristics, on the other hand, are more like mental shortcuts -- simple strategies that allow us to solve problems faster, although they’re more error-prone than algorithms. Say you’re at the store, looking for a family-sized bottle of Sriracha. You could use an algorithm and methodically check every shelf and aisle in the store. Or you could use heuristics and first search the Asian or condiment sections--the places that make the most sense based on what you already know. Heuristics may be way faster, but the algorithmic approach guarantees you won’t overlook the sauce along the way, because they stuck it in the deli or whatever dumb thing they did this week. So algorithms, heuristics, and trial-and-error are problem-solving strategies that involve a plan of attack.

But sometimes we get lucky while puzzling out a problem, and Aha!, out of nowhere a sudden flash of insight that solves our problem. I’ll use orange in the muffin recipe instead of lemon! Or, Sriracha lives in the Mexican section! For some reason! Neuroscientists have actually watched that kind of sudden, happy brain flash on neuroimaging screens. In one experiment, they gave subjects a problem to solve: What word can be added to the three words CRAB, PINE, and SAUCE to create a new compound word? Then they asked the subjects to press a button when they had the answer. While the subjects thought about it, scans showed activity in their frontal lobes, the areas involved in the focused attention of typical problem-solving.

But right at the Aha! moment, just as they pushed the button, there was a clear burst of activity just above the ear in the right temporal lobe, which, among many other things, is involved with recognition. The answer, by the way, we already gave you the hint earlier in the episode. Where’s my fish? Those sudden bursts of insight are awesome, but you can’t count on them to solve all your problems. And just because something feels, doesn’t mean it’s truly correct. Because as inventive and smartypants as we may be, our cognition often leads us astray in all kinds of ways. For instance, we often look for, and favor, evidence that verifies our ideas, while we’re more likely to avoid or ignore contradictory evidence -- a tendency known as confirmation bias.

This is really similar to the overconfidence we’ve talked about, when you’re basically more confident than you are correct. When this kind of cognitive bias takes hold, you might cling to your initial conceptions in a kind of belief perseverance, even in the face of clear proof to the contrary. This happens all the time, and it can be maddening for people watching it happen. People still think that the earth is flat! It’s like...WHAT? HOW? There’s space pictures! I probably don’t need to tell you -- people can really get weird and defensive when they evade facts and choose to see only the information that confirms their beliefs. They may even become functionally fixed, unable to view a problem from a new perspective.

Instead they just keep approaching a situation with the same mental set, especially if it’s worked in the past. Say you’ve got a nail sticking out from a board, and you’re like “I need to take care of that!” There’s rocks, and bricks all around you. But because of your functional fixedness on the idea that only hammers work on nails, you don’t even consider hitting it with the brick, and instead you waste a bunch of time in the garage looking for a hammer, and you’re angry and frustrated, and there’s still a nail sticking up from the board. So, our mental set predisposes how we think, just as you’ll remember that our perceptual set predisposes how we perceive. This is what makes heuristics -- those super-convenient mental shortcuts that we all use -- so easily fallible.

In the 1970s, cognitive psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman researched how we make snap judgments, and discovered one way smart people make dumb decisions. They found that people believe an event will be more likely to occur if they can conjure up examples or memories of it, especially if those examples are particularly vivid, scary, or awesome. So, say you’re in a casino and you win two dollars at a slot machine. Suddenly every flashing light and ringing bell in the place goes off. But when you lose -- which is the vast majority of the time -- it’s just...crickets. With all their lights and noise-making, the casino makes sure that wins are super vivid and memorable, while losses just go away unacknowledged.

That way, the next time you’re standing there with 100 bucks in your pocket, you’re more likely to overestimate your chances of winning, because the memories of winning are more striking. The more mentally available those memories are, the more it seems that it’s going to happen again. This is known as the availability heuristic. And it can warp our judgements of people, too. If we keep remembering news footage that shows people of a given group shooting guns, that can shape our impression of the entire group -- even if what we saw was only a tiny minority within that group. Essentially, we are great at fearing the wrong things. We worry about being killed in a plane crash or getting bitten in half by a shark or accidentally choking on a dumpling.

Thanks to our brain’s b-roll of horrific images, we come to fear what’s actually very rare, instead of worrying about much more common, but less memorable ends like car accidents, cancer, and heart failure. Our thinking can also be swayed by framing, or how an issue is presented. Imagine you’re considering climbing Everest or getting a nose job or eating a bowl of raw blowfish. I can frame the risks in different ways. Telling you that you’ve got a 95 percent chance of survival sounds a lot different than saying five out of a hundred people die doing this activity, though the information is the same. Our cognitive minds are capable of incredible intellectual feats and tremendous failures.

We can solve problems better than any organism on the planet, but given the chance, we can also mess up a pretty simple judgment every day of the week. But if we’re mindful of our capacity for error -- and if we honor our ingenuity and intellect -- I think our ability to solve any problem is nearly infinite. And that, gives me a lot of hope. Seriously though where is my fish? Today you learned how we use concepts, prototypes, and our mental sets to think and communicate, and how algorithms, heuristics, and insight help us solve problems. You also learned about how fixation, the availability heuristic, fear, overconfidence, and belief perseverance can get in the way of good decision-making and thinking.

- [05:24] areas involved in the focused attention of typical problem-solving.
- [05:27] But right at the Aha!
- [05:29] moment, just as they pushed the button, there was a clear burst of activity just above the
- [05:34] ear in the right temporal lobe, which, among many other things, is involved with recognition.
- [05:39] The answer, by the way, we already gave you the hint earlier in the episode.
- [05:44] Where’s my fish?
- [05:46] Those sudden bursts of insight are awesome, but you can’t count on them to solve all
- [05:51] your problems.
- [05:52] And just because something feels, doesn’t mean it’s truly correct.
- [05:56] Because as inventive and smartypants as we may be, our cognition often leads us astray
- [06:01] in all kinds of ways.
- [06:02] For instance, we often look for, and favor, evidence that verifies our ideas, while we’re
- [06:07] more likely to avoid or ignore contradictory evidence -- a tendency known as confirmation
- [06:12] bias.
- [06:13] This is really similar to the overconfidence we’ve talked about, when you’re basically
- [06:17] more confident than you are correct.
- [06:18] When this kind of cognitive bias takes hold, you might cling to your initial conceptions
- [06:22] in a kind of belief perseverance, even in the face of clear proof to the contrary.
- [06:27] This happens all the time, and it can be maddening for people watching it happen.
- [06:32] People still think that the earth is flat!
- [06:35] It’s like...WHAT?
- [06:36] HOW?
- [06:37] There’s space pictures!
- [06:38] I probably don’t need to tell you -- people can really get weird and defensive when they
- [06:44] evade facts and choose to see only the information that confirms their beliefs.
- [06:48] They may even become functionally fixed, unable to view a problem from a new perspective.
- [06:53] Instead they just keep approaching a situation with the same mental set, especially if it’s
- [06:58] worked in the past.
- [06:59] Say you’ve got a nail sticking out from a board, and you’re like “I need to take
- [07:01] care of that!”
- [07:03] There’s rocks, and bricks all around you.
- [07:06] But because of your functional fixedness on the idea that only hammers work on nails,
- [07:10] you don’t even consider hitting it with the brick, and instead you waste a bunch of
- [07:13] time in the garage looking for a hammer, and you’re angry and frustrated, and there’s
- [07:17] still a nail sticking up from the board.
- [07:20] So, our mental set predisposes how we think, just as you’ll remember that our perceptual
- [07:24] set predisposes how we perceive.
- [07:27] This is what makes heuristics -- those super-convenient mental shortcuts that we all use -- so easily
- [07:32] fallible.
- [07:33] In the 1970s, cognitive psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman researched how
- [07:38] we make snap judgments, and discovered one way smart people make dumb decisions.
- [07:42] They found that people believe an event will be more likely to occur if they can conjure
- [07:46] up examples or memories of it, especially if those examples are particularly vivid,
- [07:51] scary, or awesome.
- [07:52] So, say you’re in a casino and you win two dollars at a slot machine.
- [07:56] Suddenly every flashing light and ringing bell in the place goes off.
- [08:00] But when you lose -- which is the vast majority of the time -- it’s just...crickets.
- [08:04] With all their lights and noise-making, the casino makes sure that wins are super vivid
- [08:08] and memorable, while losses just go away unacknowledged.
- [08:12] That way, the next time you’re standing there with 100 bucks in your pocket, you’re
- [08:15] more likely to overestimate your chances of winning, because the memories of winning are
- [08:19] more striking.
- [08:20] The more mentally available those memories are, the more it seems that it’s going to
- [08:23] happen again.
- [08:24] This is known as the availability heuristic.
- [08:27] And it can warp our judgements of people, too.
- [08:29] If we keep remembering news footage that shows people of a given group shooting guns, that
- [08:34] can shape our impression of the entire group -- even if what we saw was only a tiny minority
- [08:40] within that group.
- [08:41] Essentially, we are great at fearing the wrong things.
- [08:44] We worry about being killed in a plane crash or getting bitten in half by a shark or accidentally
- [08:49] choking on a dumpling.
- [08:50] Thanks to our brain’s b-roll of horrific images, we come to fear what’s actually
- [08:54] very rare, instead of worrying about much more common, but less memorable ends like
- [08:59] car accidents, cancer, and heart failure.
- [09:01] Our thinking can also be swayed by framing, or how an issue is presented.
- [09:05] Imagine you’re considering climbing Everest or getting a nose job or eating a bowl of
- [09:10] raw blowfish.
- [09:11] I can frame the risks in different ways.
- [09:13] Telling you that you’ve got a 95 percent chance of survival sounds a lot different
- [09:16] than saying five out of a hundred people die doing this activity, though the information
- [09:20] is the same.
- [09:21] Our cognitive minds are capable of incredible intellectual feats and tremendous failures.
- [09:27] We can solve problems better than any organism on the planet, but given the chance, we can
- [09:31] also mess up a pretty simple judgment every day of the week.
- [09:35] But if we’re mindful of our capacity for error -- and if we honor our ingenuity and
- [09:39] intellect -- I think our ability to solve any problem is nearly infinite.
- [09:43] And that, gives me a lot of hope.
- [09:45] Seriously though where is my fish?
- [09:47] Today you learned how we use concepts, prototypes, and our mental sets to think and communicate,
- [09:53] and how algorithms, heuristics, and insight help us solve problems.
- [09:57] You also learned about how fixation, the availability heuristic, fear, overconfidence, and belief
- [10:03] perseverance can get in the way of good decision-making and thinking.

### Transcript (reading)

In your lifetime, you have probably stared down any number of ability tests and course exams and PSATs, SATs, ACTs, GREs, GCSEs, whatever you got in your country. Humans, it seems, really get a thrill out of measuring, ranking, and comparing each other's intelligence. Unfortunately, as you saw last week, historically, we have been kind of bad at that. Today, we think of intelligence as determined by a series of factors related to genetics, environment, education, perhaps even randomness itself, some aspects of which may correlate with belonging to a particular social group, and others not. The key here, though, is that we don't fully understand how or how much some of these factors work.

How do elements like personal history and conditions like poverty, access to education, stress, even nutrition affect someone's scores on cognitive tests? And if a group of people share some of these conditions, how will they respond--both as individuals and as a group--to certain potentially biased intelligence tests? In the end, the irony is that in our ongoing effort to measure human intelligence, most of what we've learned is simply what we don't know. [Intro] What is a piano? Which one of these things is least like the others? Juice is to glass as hand is to what? Which one of these numbers does not belong in the series? Bernice had x number of jelly beans. She ate one, then gave half of what was left to Bruno, then she ate another and gave half of the remainder to her dog.

Now, she only has five beans. How many did she--ahheh uhhhh. These questions are similar to what you'd find on today's most widely-used intelligence tests. The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, or WAIS, and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, or WISC. Originally published by psychologist David Wechsler in 1955, the current edition of the exam consists of fifteen different sub-tests that assess things like vocabulary, similarities between objects and concepts, and patterns in letters and numbers. Cognitive tests usually fall into one of two categories: achievement, or the kind that reflect what you've learned, and aptitude - the kind that's supposed to predict your ability to learn something new.

So the WAIS and the WISC are aptitude tests, and your final exam at the end of your math class is an achievement test. So, how do we know if an intelligence test, or any other test for that matter, is actually any good? Well, today, we do have some standards. To be widely accepted, a test must hit three important marks. It has to be standardized, reliable, and valid. Standardization is basically about comparability. Whether you answer 15 or 50 questions correctly on a test actually means very little until you can compare those scores against how others performed. So, to achieve meaningful comparisons, test-makers must first give the test to a representative sample group, which sets a standard by which to compare future test-takers.

You've probably heard of a bell-curve. Whether you're measuring height or mental aptitude or love of the Beatles, it's often assumed that everyone you're measuring will fall into what's called a normal pattern: most scores will fall in the mid-range, while fewer hit the extremes. And actually, it's those extremes that intelligence tests are most widely and effectively used for. It might help an educator identify a gifted student who totally blows the roof off a test, but they're also useful in helping clinicians determine who might have a disability or be facing some specific barrier. With victims of traumatic brain injury or stroke, for example, a WAIS test can do a nice job of sussing out whether a patient who's struggling with language actually has

a problem remembering and identifying words, or if they're just having a hard time processing the information quickly. But these tests should be regarded more skeptically when it comes to issues that are either way more specific or way more broad. Like, they won't be able to answer questions along the lines of, "Will Jesse get into Harvard?" or "Are women smarter than men?" They're just not designed to do that. And in any case, simply knowing where you fall on a normal curve on a standardized test doesn't mean much if the test is poorly designed, so along with being standardized, a good test has high reliability, meaning it yields dependably consistent results. One way to determine this is to have people take the same test a second time, or some similar version of it.

If the two performances resemble one another -- if the scores correlate -- then the test is thought to have good reliability. And the third requirement for the testing trifecta is simply validity, or the extent to which a test measures or predicts what it's supposed to. And there are different kinds of validity -- for instance, if I take the WAIS IQ test and my scores accurately predict how good my grades in college will be, that's a simple kind of predictive or criterion validity. On the other hand, if I take the test and my scores correlate strongly with my results on another similar cognitive test, like the Stanford Binet, that falls under the broad category of construct validity.

The key is that all of these are ways to see if a test measures what it claims to measure. But the stickiest wicket of them all is what we make of the test scores themselves. We've all heard plenty about the influence of both nature and nurture in psychology, so the big question is: do our genetics influence our intelligence, or does our environment? And this is an easy question to answer because they both do. And that is important. If the history of intelligence testing has taught us anything, it's that assuming everyone is smart in the same way and for the same reason can lead to disastrously bad conclusions. So let's look at the scientific evidence, and the best place for that is the wealth of twin and adoption studies, which have been fascinatingly helpful in illustrating how

genetics and environment can both influence intelligence. For example, research has shown that identical twins who were raised together have the highest rate of similarity in intelligence scores of any group. Fraternal twins who share only half the genes tend to be much less similar in their scores, even when raised in the same home. Likewise, neuroimaging studies show that certain brain regions, like those associated with language, are structurally similar between identical twins, and show similar activity while doing the same kinds of mental tasks. The brains of fraternal twins raised in the same home are very similar in some areas, but less so in others. But identical twins who are raised together have the same brain, at least, according to neuroimaging scans.

Some studies even showed that identical twins raised apart from each other show higher intelligence correlation than fraternal twins raised together. And maybe even more interesting is that these intelligence correlations actually increase over time. In one mega-study of eleven thousand twin pairs in four countries, that correlation kept increasing from middle-childhood to adolescence to young adulthood and continued to increase through adulthood. Similar research has looked at adopted children and compared their scores with those of their adopted siblings, parents, and biological parents. And the results can be kind of surprising, because as adopted kids grow up, their mental similarities to their adoptive families actually get smaller over time until there's virtually

no correlation by adulthood. Instead, they become more similar in terms of mental aptitude to their biological parents over time, even if they never met. In other words: genes appear to matter. You could take a hundred kids and raise them in the exact same way, and as adults, they'd still have different aptitudes. But, does this mean that when it comes to intelligence, we're all nature and no nurture? Well, luckily, and somewhat obviously, no. Life experiences and environment also matter. One sad example of how early environments affect children can be found in the work of American psychologist J. McVicker Hunt in a destitute Iranian orphanage in the 1970s. Conditions were really, really bad; infants received minimal care, and whatever attention

they did get was on a routine schedule, never in response to whether they were cooing or crying or anything else. Basically, they were being raised with no cause and effect between their behaviors and the responses of their caregivers, and as a result, they didn't learn how to communicate. With no stimulation or social response, the kids were just kind of passive, vacant lumps. Deprivation was essentially trumping any inborn intelligence. So, Hunt started a program. He trained caregivers to actually talk to infants, to teach them how to mimic sounds and actions, and eventually, sounds and words from their language. The results were tremendous. The kids started to learn really quickly, and basically just came alive.

While it's an extreme example, Hunt's research showed how malleable early childhood intelligence can be, especially in disadvantaged and stressful conditions. So you can see that environment and heredity interact to affect intelligence, and that some tricky implications can come out of that conclusion. But that's hardly the only controversy when it comes to how we view and measure intelligence. There have been some sensational headline-courting studies of genetic and social influences that have suggested that fundamental differences in intelligence may exist between genders and races, but many of these studies are tangled up in questions of how potential testing bias may affect performance.

Basically, if a test inadvertently measures differences caused by cultural experiences or social factors instead of what we might call "innate intelligence", then you might say that the test is biased. Extreme example: in the past, immigrants to the US were classified as "feeble minded" if they couldn't answer distinctly American questions, like "Who was the first American president?" or "What's a milkshake?". Today, concerns about bias focuses on differences among members of the same general culture. Say, a poor, rural kid who might be plenty smart, but will test low if questions involve urban, upper-class concepts like taking taxis and drinking tea out of china cups or the rules of tennis.

So the questions themselves can skew performance results, but who administers the test can also affect outcomes. Women tend to do better with a fellow female administrator, and African Americans often score higher if their test is given by an African American instructor. And the risk of bias may even fall to the test-takers' own expectations. For example, many studies have found that if you give a math test to equally capable men and women, but just before starting, you tell the subjects that women usually score lower than men, you actually negatively affect the women's performance. This self-fulfilling concern that you might mess up and inadvertently fulfill some negative stereotype is called stereotype threat.

It was first described by social psychologist Claude Steele and Joshua Aronson, and it's been demonstrated frequently across a whole host of interesting studies. Now, we've only scratched the surface of this mess that is intelligence testing. An important thing to remember next time you ace or bomb a test is that you are far more complicated and nuanced than any test score. Don't let a number puff you up or drag you down, and don't let it define you. We all have room for self-improvement. We are all full of infinite surprising potential. Ah, and answers to the questions I asked earlier: A piano is a musical instrument played using a keyboard, banana is the least similar to the others, juice is to class as hand is to

glove, the number two does not belong in the series, and Bernice began with twenty-three jellybeans. Today, your intelligent mind learned how we currently use WAIS and WISC tests to measure intelligence, and how important it is that a test be standardized, reliable, and valid. We also looked at how genetics, environment, testing bias, and stereotype threat can affect IQ test performance.

- [07:28] Deprivation was essentially trumping any inborn intelligence.
- [07:31] So, Hunt started a program.
- [07:33] He trained caregivers to actually talk to infants, to teach them how to mimic sounds
- [07:37] and actions, and eventually, sounds and words from their language.
- [07:40] The results were tremendous.
- [07:42] The kids started to learn really quickly, and basically just came alive.
- [07:45] While it's an extreme example, Hunt's research showed how malleable early childhood intelligence
- [07:50] can be, especially in disadvantaged and stressful conditions.
- [07:53] So you can see that environment and heredity interact to affect intelligence, and that
- [07:57] some tricky implications can come out of that conclusion.
- [08:00] But that's hardly the only controversy when it comes to how we view and measure intelligence.
- [08:05] There have been some sensational headline-courting studies of genetic and social influences that
- [08:10] have suggested that fundamental differences in intelligence may exist between genders
- [08:15] and races, but many of these studies are tangled up in questions of how potential testing bias
- [08:20] may affect performance.
- [08:21] Basically, if a test inadvertently measures differences caused by cultural experiences
- [08:25] or social factors instead of what we might call "innate intelligence", then you might
- [08:30] say that the test is biased.
- [08:31] Extreme example: in the past, immigrants to the US were classified as "feeble minded"
- [08:36] if they couldn't answer distinctly American questions, like "Who was the first American
- [08:40] president?" or "What's a milkshake?".
- [08:43] Today, concerns about bias focuses on differences among members of the same general culture.
- [08:46] Say, a poor, rural kid who might be plenty smart, but will test low if questions involve
- [08:51] urban, upper-class concepts like taking taxis and drinking tea out of china cups or the
- [08:56] rules of tennis.
- [08:57] So the questions themselves can skew performance results, but who administers the test can
- [09:01] also affect outcomes.
- [09:03] Women tend to do better with a fellow female administrator, and African Americans often
- [09:07] score higher if their test is given by an African American instructor.
- [09:10] And the risk of bias may even fall to the test-takers' own expectations.
- [09:14] For example, many studies have found that if you give a math test to equally capable
- [09:19] men and women, but just before starting, you tell the subjects that women usually score
- [09:23] lower than men, you actually negatively affect the women's performance.
- [09:27] This self-fulfilling concern that you might mess up and inadvertently fulfill some negative
- [09:31] stereotype is called stereotype threat.
- [09:34] It was first described by social psychologist Claude Steele and Joshua Aronson, and it's
- [09:37] been demonstrated frequently across a whole host of interesting studies.
- [09:41] Now, we've only scratched the surface of this mess that is intelligence testing.
- [09:45] An important thing to remember next time you ace or bomb a test is that you are far more
- [09:49] complicated and nuanced than any test score.
- [09:52] Don't let a number puff you up or drag you down, and don't let it define you.
- [09:56] We all have room for self-improvement.
- [09:58] We are all full of infinite surprising potential.
- [10:02] Ah, and answers to the questions I asked earlier: A piano is a musical instrument played using
- [10:06] a keyboard, banana is the least similar to the others, juice is to class as hand is to
- [10:10] glove, the number two does not belong in the series, and Bernice began with twenty-three
- [10:15] jellybeans.
- [10:16] Today, your intelligent mind learned how we currently use WAIS and WISC tests to measure
- [10:21] intelligence, and how important it is that a test be standardized, reliable, and valid.
- [10:26] We also looked at how genetics, environment, testing bias, and stereotype threat can affect
- [10:30] IQ test performance.

Smarty pants, egg head, brainiac. You've heard terms like these before, maybe you've even been on the receiving end of one of them. But actually, defining intelligence is a lot trickier than just coming up with new names for smart people. I mean, intelligence isn't like height or weight; you can't just toss them on a scale and give it an exact measurement. It has different meanings for different cultures and ages and skill sets. So what is intelligence? It's a question that doesn't give us a lot of answers, but it does open a bunch of other equally important and interesting questions. Like, what influences it? And how can it be assessed? Is it a single, general ability, or does it cover a range of aptitudes and skills and talents?

How do things like creativity and innovation factor in? Or genetics or environment, or education? And what about emotional intelligence? Most agree that it's best to think of intelligence not of a concrete thing so much as a concept, the ability to learn from experience, solve problems, and use knowledge to adapt to new experiences. We've often used intelligence tests, to assess and compare mental aptitude, but these tests have a long, complex and dark history. I mean there are Nazis involved so, yeah. So as you'll see, there are reasons that intelligence is one of the most hotly debated subjects in psychology. It's complicated and controversial. [Intro] What if I'm the world's greatest Rubik's cube solver but a terrible speller?

Or a truly gifted artist who's barely mastered long division? Could anyone say I was intelligent or not based on those different aptitudes, or would it be more accurate to measure my brainpower on several different scales? Around the turn of the twentieth century, British psychologist Charles Spearman suggested that yes, we do have one comprehensive general intelligence that underlies all of specific mental abilities. He called it the G-Factor. Spearman conceded that while people may have special talents like basket weaving or saxophone solos or doing crossword puzzles, those things still fell under "G". And he helped develop a statistical procedure called factor analysis to try to determine how certain clusters of skills might correlate with another one.

Like, say someone who tests well in spatial skills might be good with numbers. We might then refer to that cluster of skills, that factor, as spatial-numeric reasoning. But to Spearman, the G-factor was something of an uber-factor connected to all intelligent behavior from architecture to healing to survival skills, and it's why people who do well on one kind of cognitive test tend to do well on others. But as you can imagine, reducing intelligence to a single numerical test score was and is problematic. L.L. Thurstone, an American pioneer of psychometrics and one of Spearman's first challengers, was not into ranking people on a single scale. Thurstone administered 56 different tests to his subjects then used them to identify seven clusters of mental abilities.

By this system, you might turn out to be great at like verbal comprehension but less stellar at something like numerical ability. Sounds fair. But when researchers followed up on his findings, they actually did see that high scores in one aptitude usually meant good scores in the others, essentially backing up some evidence for some kind of G-factor. Even though their ideas did not often align, Spearman and Thurstone together paved the way for more contemporary theories on intelligence. For example, American psychologist Howard Gardner views intelligence as multiple abilities that come in different forms. He references instances of brain damage where one ability may be destroyed while others stay perfectly intact.

Savants usually have some limited metal abilities but one exceptional ability when it comes to like, computing figures or memorizing the complete works of Shakespeare. To Gardner, this suggests that we have multiple intelligences beyond the G-factor. In fact, he believes that we have eight intelligences, ranging from our skills with numbers and words to our ability to understand physical space and the natural world. American psychologist Robert Sternberg tends to agree with Gardner, though he boils them down into three intelligences: analytical, or problem-solving intelligence, creative intelligence, or the ability to adapt to new situations, and practical intelligence for everyday tasks.

Both of these models seem reasonable, too, and Gardner and Sternberg's work has helped teachers appreciate students' variety of talents. But research has suggested that even these different ways to be smart are also linked by some underlying general intelligence factor. So what about other less tangible forms of intelligence, like creativity, our ability to produce ideas that are both novel and valuable? How can a test that demands one correct answer account for more creative solutions, so-called "divergent thinking". Well, traditional intelligence tests can't, and so far, while we do have some tests that look at creative potential, we don't have a standardized system for quantifying creativity.

But Sternberg and his colleagues have identified five main components of creativity, which are useful for framing our understanding of what creative intelligence is and how it works. If you go through the list, you know who I think is really great at almost all of them? Sherlock Holmes. Hear me out. First we've got expertise, or a well-developed base of knowledge. This just means knowing a lot about a lot. Whether it's arcane poisons, jellyfish behavior, or how to recognize a secret passage behind a book shelf, expertise provides the mind with all sorts of data to work with and combine in new ways. Obviously Sherlock has incredible imaginative thinking skills, too, which provide him with the ability to see things in new ways, recognize patterns and make connections.

He loves nothing more than rehashing these breadcrumb trails for the dopey constables at the end of the case. Sternberg also thought a venturesome personality contributes to creativity. By hanging around opium dens and chasing thugs and generally courting danger, Sherlock routinely seeks new experiences, tolerates risk, and perseveres in overcoming obstacles. And everyone knows he's driven by intrinsic motivation. I mean, he wants to help the widow discover the thief and everything, but really, Sherlock is driven by his own interest and sense of challenge. He gets pleasure from the work itself. And finally, Sherlock benefits from a creative environment which sparks, supports, and refines his ideas.

For so affectionately maintaining this environment on Sherlock's behalf, we largely have Dr. Watson to thank. Sherlock was obviously an academic and creative genius, but he was pretty weak in another form of intelligence: the emotional kind. Emotional intelligence, defined in 1997 by psychologist Peter Salovey and John Mayer -- no, not, not that one-- is the ability to perceive, understand, manage, and use emotions. I don't know about you, but I know plenty of smart people who have a hard time processing social information. The most brilliant mathematician may struggle to communicate with colleagues, neighbors, or staff at the local deli. Likewise, Sherlock often annoys, offends, or even baffles those around him.

Perceiving emotions means being able to recognize them in faces, and even in music, film, and stories. Understanding emotions relates to being able to predict them and how they might change. And managing emotions comes down to knowing how to appropriately express yourself in various situations. And finally, emotional intelligence also means using emotions to enable adaptive or creative thinking; like knowing how to manage conflict or comfort a grieving friend or work well with others. Much like creative intelligence, emotional intelligence can be measured to some degree through testing, but there's no standardized way to, like, assign a numerical value. So if we can't perfectly quantify things like creativity or emotional smarts, how did we come up with a way to measure intelligence?

Well, as I mentioned earlier, it's a sordid story. The first attempts to do it in the western world began with English scientist Francis Galton in the 1800s. Taking a page from his famous cousin Charles Darwin's theories on natural selection, Galton wondered how that premise might extend to humans' natural ability when it came to intelligence. He suggested that our smarts have a lot to do with heredity, so if we encouraged smart people to breed with each other, we could essentially create a master race of geniuses. If that sounds a little sketchy, it's because it was, like, really, really sketchy!! This study of how to selectively and supposedly improve the human population, especially by encouraging breeding in some people and discouraging it in others, is called "eugenics".

A term Galton himself coined, and I'll get back to, in a minute. But around the turn of the twentieth century when eugenics was taking off, the French government mandated that all children must attend school. Many of these kids had never been in a classroom and teachers wanted to figure out how they could identify kids who needed extra help. Enter Alfred Binet and Theodore Simon, two French psychologists who were commissioned to develop a test to measure a child's so-called mental age. The concept of a kid's mental age is essentially the level of performance associated with a certain chronological age. So if six year old Bruno tests as well as the average six year old, he'd have a mental age of six.

Binet believed that his tests could measure a child's current mental abilities, but that intelligence wasn't a fixed, inborn thing. He believed a person's capabilities could be raised with proper attention, self-discipline and practice. In other words, he was no eugenicist. He was hoping that his tests would improve children's education by identifying those who needed extra attention. But Binet also feared that these tests would, in the wrong hands, be used to do just the opposite: labeling children as "lost causes", limiting their opportunities. And wow, was he on to something because that is pretty much exactly what happened. German psychologist William Stern used revisions of Binet and Simon's work to create the famous intelligence quotient, or IQ measurement.

At the time, your IQ was simply your mental age, divided by your chronological age, multiplied by a hundred. So for example Bruno is six, and so is his mental age, so his IQ ranks at a hundred, but his little sister Betty is a four year-old with a mental age of five, so her IQ would be 125. That formula works pretty well for measuring kids, but it falls apart when it comes to adults who don't hit measurable developmental steps like kids do. I mean there's no real difference between a mental age of 34 and 35. But Stanford professor Lewis Terman started promoting the widespread use of intelligence tests in the early 1900s, and with his help the US government began the world's first massive ministration of intelligence tests, when it assessed World War I army recruits

and immigrants fresh off the boat. Unlike Binet, Terman did use these numerical findings as a kind of label, and he thought his tests could, as he put it: "ultimately result in curtailing the reproduction of feeble-mindedness". This kind of testing played right into eugenicists' sensibilities, and soon the eugenics movement in the US had a pretty good fanclub, raising money from the Carnegie's and Rockafeller's and with proponents working at Harvard and Columbia and Cornell. In the first half of the 21st century, intelligence tests were used to enforce the sterilization of about 60,000 people, around a third of whom were in California. Most were poor white women, often unwed mothers or prostitutes.

Other eugenics efforts persisted later into the century, and there is evidence of poor African American, Native American, or Latina women being forcibly or covertly sterilized in large numbers as recently as the 1970s. But do you know who really loved their eugenics? The Nazis. Hitler and his cronies took the idea of intelligence testing to even darker conclusions. The Nazis were all about selecting against so-called "feeble-mindedness" and other undesirable traits as they sought to strengthen what they saw as their Aryan nation. They sterilized or simply executed hundreds of thousands of victims based of their answers to IQ test questions that were really more abut adhering to social norms than measuring actual intelligence.

Questions like: "Who was Bismarck?" and "What does Christmas signify?" So you can see how this terrifying history still makes some people leery of how such tests are administered, interpreted, and weighted. Today we understand that intelligence, as defined by all the people we've talked about here, does appear to be a real and measurable phenomenon. But no one can say that they've disentangled all of the would-be genetic, environmental, educational, and socio-economic components of it. In the end, it's best to think of intelligence as something about which we've still got a lot to learn. And next week, we'll talk about how we test intelligence today and the problems we still face in doing it.

Today, your intelligent mind learned about the history of how we think about and define different types of intelligence, what the G-factor is, and how Sherlock Holmes is incredibly intelligent but emotionally unintelligent. You also learned about the history and methods of intelligence testing, IQ scores, and how eugenics turned to the dark side, and has since made even talking about intelligence kind of controversial.

- [08:47] He was hoping that his tests would improve children's education by identifying those
- [08:51] who needed extra attention.
- [08:52] But Binet also feared that these tests would, in the wrong hands, be used to do just the
- [08:57] opposite: labeling children as "lost causes", limiting their opportunities.
- [09:02] And wow, was he on to something because that is pretty much exactly what happened.
- [09:06] German psychologist William Stern used revisions of Binet and Simon's work to create the famous
- [09:11] intelligence quotient, or IQ measurement.
- [09:13] At the time, your IQ was simply your mental age, divided by your chronological age, multiplied
- [09:19] by a hundred.
- [09:20] So for example Bruno is six, and so is his mental age, so his IQ ranks at a hundred,
- [09:25] but his little sister Betty is a four year-old with a mental age of five, so her IQ would
- [09:29] be 125.
- [09:30] That formula works pretty well for measuring kids, but it falls apart when it comes to
- [09:34] adults who don't hit measurable developmental steps like kids do.
- [09:37] I mean there's no real difference between a mental age of 34 and 35.
- [09:41] But Stanford professor Lewis Terman started promoting the widespread use of intelligence
- [09:45] tests in the early 1900s, and with his help the US government began the world's first
- [09:50] massive ministration of intelligence tests, when it assessed World War I army recruits
- [09:55] and immigrants fresh off the boat.
- [09:57] Unlike Binet, Terman did use these numerical findings as a kind of label, and he thought
- [10:01] his tests could, as he put it: "ultimately result in curtailing the reproduction of feeble-mindedness".
- [10:08] This kind of testing played right into eugenicists' sensibilities, and soon the eugenics movement
- [10:12] in the US had a pretty good fanclub, raising money from the Carnegie's and Rockafeller's
- [10:16] and with proponents working at Harvard and Columbia and Cornell.
- [10:19] In the first half of the 21st century, intelligence tests were used to enforce the sterilization
- [10:24] of about 60,000 people, around a third of whom were in California.
- [10:28] Most were poor white women, often unwed mothers or prostitutes.
- [10:32] Other eugenics efforts persisted later into the century, and there is evidence of poor
- [10:36] African American, Native American, or Latina women being forcibly or covertly sterilized
- [10:41] in large numbers as recently as the 1970s.
- [10:43] But do you know who really loved their eugenics?
- [10:46] The Nazis.
- [10:47] Hitler and his cronies took the idea of intelligence testing to even darker conclusions.
- [10:51] The Nazis were all about selecting against so-called "feeble-mindedness" and other undesirable
- [10:56] traits as they sought to strengthen what they saw as their Aryan nation.
- [11:00] They sterilized or simply executed hundreds of thousands of victims based of their answers
- [11:04] to IQ test questions that were really more abut adhering to social norms than measuring
- [11:08] actual intelligence.
- [11:10] Questions like: "Who was Bismarck?"
- [11:11] and "What does Christmas signify?"
- [11:13] So you can see how this terrifying history still makes some people leery of how such
- [11:17] tests are administered, interpreted, and weighted.
- [11:20] Today we understand that intelligence, as defined by all the people we've talked about
- [11:24] here, does appear to be a real and measurable phenomenon.
- [11:27] But no one can say that they've disentangled all of the would-be genetic, environmental,
- [11:32] educational, and socio-economic components of it.
- [11:35] In the end, it's best to think of intelligence as something about which we've still got a
- [11:38] lot to learn.
- [11:39] And next week, we'll talk about how we test intelligence today and the problems we still
- [11:44] face in doing it.
- [11:45] Today, your intelligent mind learned about the history of how we think about and define
- [11:49] different types of intelligence, what the G-factor is, and how Sherlock Holmes is incredibly
- [11:54] intelligent but emotionally unintelligent.
- [11:57] You also learned about the history and methods of intelligence testing, IQ scores, and how
- [12:01] eugenics turned to the dark side, and has since made even talking about intelligence
- [12:05] kind of controversial.

### Transcript (reading)

Baby Kanzi was recently adopted and adjusting to life in his new home. His mother was working with a language coach to learn some English, and Kanzi usually came along, though he didn't appear to pay much attention. But the language coach noticed that he seemed to be picking up on how to communicate just by watching his mother's lessons. Oddly enough, it appeared that he was picking things up faster than his mom. For example, the phrases, "You tickle" and "tickle you" meant two different things. And Kanzi's mom, she was having a hard time understanding that syntax. One day, Kanzi was hanging out, playing with stuffed animals, and the coach asked him to make the dog bite the snake. Kanzi put the snake into the dog's mouth

like it was no big deal. It was a really big deal, because Kanzi is a bonobo. He's actually a language superstar. Even among the elite research primates, like Koko the gorilla, Kanzi was the first ape to demonstrate that language can be acquired spontaneously through observation, without planned training, and the first to show a rudimentary understanding of grammar, syntax, and semantics. Again, really big deal! Especially because for years, humans have been proclaiming that it's language that sets us apart from other animals. But are we really alone? Turns out, that question keeps getting more and more complicated. Technically, we define language as a set of spoken, written, or signed words, and the way

we combine them to communicate meaning. If we change that definition to include the use of complex grammar, then maybe we are alone. But if language is simply the ability to communicate through a meaningful sequence of symbols, as I might do while looking for a bathroom in Sweden, or Kanzi does when she's asking for roast marshmallows, well then welcome to the club, apes! [INTRO MUSIC] We communicate in part by engaging our brains and bodies to make sounds that let us transfer thoughts from our brain to other people's brains. But of course, language is more than just making air vibrate with sound. I can communicate by moving my hands, which you might have noticed I do pretty frequently, or by using visual symbols.

All of these forms of language allow us to comprehend things we've never actually witnessed, and exchange information with each other quickly and effectively to, y'know, get a job, or be a friend, or use a metaphor. It's hard to imagine a fulfilling life without some kind of language. Humans have nearly 7,000 different languages and no matter how different they sound, we can break down their basic structure in the same way, using the same three building blocks. The smallest of them are phonemes. These are very short, distinctive sound units like "a," "t," "ch," "sh," like, stuff like that. English uses about 40 of them. Phonemes go together to make morphemes, which are the smallest units that carry meaning. This can be words or parts of words, like a prefix

or a suffix for example. The word "speech" is a morpheme that contains four phoneme sound units: "s," "p," "ee," "ch." From there, you arrange morphemes into your language's grammar or system of rules, allowing you to say the things that you want to say. So those 40 English phonemes give us over 100,000 morphemes that produce the more than 616,000 words in the Oxford English Dictionary, which can be arranged into an infinite number of sentences, paragraphs, Wu-Tang lyrics, or Shakespearean plays. And just as the structure of language starts small, so does how we learn language. And we start very young. The word "infant" comes from the Latin "in fans," meaning "not speaking." But as early as four months, they can recognize differences in speech

and start to read lips, matching mouth movements with their corresponding sounds like, "ah," "e," "i," "o." And even at this age, you got to watch what you say about kids in their presence, because this also marks the beginning of receptive language, or the ability to understand what's being said, both to and about us. Soon, that receptive language blooms to accommodate productive language, when instead of just understanding other people, babies start developing the ability to produce words. Of course, that takes a while, but in the meantime, they get a lot of practice babbling. Beginning at about four months, they start to make all sorts of sounds. Although you may get a "dada" or a "mama," babbling is not an imitation of adult speech. In fact, it typically includes sounds

from many different languages, and a stranger couldn't tell if a kid was Italian or Kenyan or Korean just by the sound of her babbling. Similarly, deaf babies will watch their parents signing and start babbling with their hands by about 10 months. That babbling morphs into something that starts to make sense, and "mama" probably really means "mama" now. Without exposure to other languages, a child will actually lose the ability to both hear and create particular tones and sounds that aren't part of his or her household language. So someone who speaks English around the house soon won't be able to differentiate between certain phonemes in Mandarin if they heard them, for instance, or between aspirated and non-aspirated consonants

in Hindi. By the time they're mowing down the first birthday cake, most kids will be entering the one-word stage of language development. They now know that sounds carry specific meanings, and connect the sound "dog" to that furry thing across the room. By around 18 months, their capacity for learning new words jumps from about one a week to one a day, and by the time they're two they're probably speaking in two-word statements. These choppy sentences are kind of like a telegraphic speech -- they sound like clumsy texts or old-school telegrams, using mostly nouns and verbs. "Want juice," "No pants," that kind of stuff. These little sentences make sense and they follow the rules of their language's syntax. For example, an English-speaking child would put an

adjective before a noun: "Black cat" while a Spanish speaker would reverse that: "gato negro." From there, the average kid is soon uttering longer phrases in complete sentences -- refusing to put pants on and demanding more crackers. Most humans hit these same milestones during their language development, but there are competing theories about how our infant babbles turn into complex sentences and how we acquire language. You'll remember B.F. Skinner, the pioneering behaviorist who brought us learning through reinforcement. He believed language was a product of associative principles and operant conditioning. Skinner argued that a kid learned to associate words with meanings largely through reinforcement. So in the Skinner model, for example, if baby Bruno says "mmmm" and his mother

gives him some milk, he'll find that outcome (both the milk and the attention) rewarding, and eventually, work his way up to saying, "milk," through these learned associations and shaping processes. It's good to be understood, right? But as usual, not everyone was on board with Skinner. In particular, legendary American linguist Noam Chomsky argued that a kid like Bruno would never reach his full, complex, sonnet-writing potential if his learning was dependent on conditioning alone. Chonsky instead proposed the idea of innate learning and ubiquitous grammatical categories, pointing out that while the world's thousands of languages may sound wildly diverse, they're actually very similar, sharing some basic elements. He called this "universal grammar."

Chomsky's universal grammar posited that all human languages contain nouns, verbs, and adjectives, and humans are born with an innate ability to acquire language, and even a genetic predisposition to learn grammatical rules, rather than being linguistic blank slates. Chomsky suggested that we're hardwired for it from day one. In the end though, we're still not sure how we acquire language; however, developmental research and studies of other species have given us a sense that at least some of it is innate, while the role of learning and exposure is also important. So if it's true that all humans have some innate capacity for language, where in the brain is it sitting? We've talked a lot about how function is localized in the brain, and that is definitely

true for some aspects of language, but while speaking, reading, writing, and even singing all fall under the language umbrella, their locations in the brain are a little more complicated. Consider aphasia, a neurological impairment of language. People can experience lots of different kinds of aphasia, depending on whether they've suffered an injury, or stroke, or a tumor, or dementia. So maybe they can speak but not read, maybe they can sing but barely speak, or write but not read. The region of the brain known as Broca's Area and the left frontal lobe is involved with the production of speech. If i suffered a trauma to this area, I might still comprehend speech but struggled to speak, although I might still be able to sing, because that's conducted elsewhere in the brain.

On the other hand, that falling coconut struck another region called the Vernicas Area, a region in the left temporal lobe involved in the expression and comprehension of language, I'd still be able to speak, but my language wouldn't make any sense, so you might find me saying something like, "it was two pizza i called purple brother on the television." Aphasia and other brain injuries remind us how thinking and language are both separate and intricately entwined. For instance, it's hard to say if non-verbal ideas come to us first and we think of the words to name them, or if instead, our thoughts are born in language. Or if we'd be able to even think without it. And because language often helps to frame your ideas, your thinking might

actually be influenced by which language you're using. So what are the implications of this? If we expand the definition of language to include other species, how might Kanzi's ability to communicate that he wants a marshmallow affect his thinking, and how might that thinking influence his language progression and his identity? If only i had the words to describe how fascinating this all is. If you understood the language I was using today, you learned how languages are built from phonemes, morphemes, and grammar; and when children acquire receptive and productive language and pass through the babbling one-word and two-word phases of development. You also learned some theories on how we acquire language, what brain areas are involved, and

how thinking and language are connected. Thanks for watching, especially to all of our Subbable subscribers.

Even though you can't see me, you know that I am here talking to you. And I can probably persuade you that this container of water and this container of water have the same amount of water, which they do, even though they don't look like they do. And you'll see I left my anglerfish behind me. If someone were to move it without my knowing, you'd rightly expect me to look for it first where I originally left it. ...Nnnugh!! You can figure out all these things because you are far down the path of cognitive development. Your parents will be proud. But there was a time in your life, in all our lives, when simple concepts like these were totally baffling. Of course, lots of things influence how your mind and its relationship with the world grows over time.

Both our genetics and our environment begin to affect our development long before we're even born, and they continue to influence our learning until the day we die. And even though we're born with nearly the same number of brain cells we'll ever have, our complete set of brain hardware takes years to solidify as our neural networks grow more complex. The study of our physical changes, cognitive, social and emotional changes throughout our whole lives - from prenatal to preteen to post-retirement - is called developmental psychology. It's how we grow into who we are. And it begins with the growth of knowledge itself: the process by which you mature into the anglerfish-tracking water-beaker-estimating peekaboo-master that you are today.

[Intro] As we age, we tend to follow a sequence of changes in behavior and appearance called maturation. Everyone is affected differently by their personal experience, of course, but we all share inherent genetic growth tendencies. We roll over before we sit, we sit before stand, and we stand before we walk, and we walk before we break dance. The same thing applies to our cognitive development - how we learn to think, know, remember and communicate. And if you're gonna talk about cognitive development, you gotta start with Jean Piaget, developmental psychologist extraordinaire. Piaget was from Switzerland where he was kind of a wunderkind and got his PhD in zoology in 1918, began dabbling in Freud psychoanalysis. After graduation, he headed to France to work

on a method for testing children's aptitudes and abilities. While administering these tests, Piaget began to notice how younger kids kept giving wrong answers to certain questions. He became fascinated by the fact that children of a certain age consistently made particular mistakes that older kids and adults didn't. Like the younger kids would have a really hard time understanding the idea I just showed you, that this container has the same amount of water in it as in this container. Or that this row of coins has the same number as this row. While others might have dismissed these as childish mistakes, Piaget theorized that it was because humans go through specific stages of cognitive development and intellectual progression. His main game was asking 'How does knowledge grow?'

He proposed that as we grow and struggle to make sense of our experiences, we create schemas, or mental frameworks that help interpret information. Schemas are like concepts, ranging from physical things like birds and hats and eye patches to abstract ideas like friendship and betrayal. And we're constantly striving for cognitive equilibrium, or harmony, between our thought processes and our environments, which are always giving us new things to think about and adjust to. Piaget proposed that we adapt to new experiences through two processes that are closely related - assimilation and accommodation. When we assimilate new experiences, we interpret them in terms of our existing schemas. So if a toddler has never seen a deer but has a schema for a horse, she may call the first

deer she sees a horsey. She wants to fit it within her understanding. But with more interactions in the world, our minds expand to accommodate, or adjust to new experiences. So soon enough, that kid realizes that deer aren't just horses, and she adjusts her schema. From there, she'll be able to tell the difference between Bambi and Black Beauty in no time. But our knowledge base grows in ways that are much more complex than just those two steps, and Piaget knew that. He went on to devise a four-stage theory of cognitive development that described how we learn in different phases of our lives. He called stage one the sensorimotor stage, which begins at birth and continues on to about age two. This is the time when babies experience the world through their senses

and actions. Touching and grabbing and looking and hearing. And putting things in their mouth. From what I can tell, mostly just putting things in their mouth. Younger babies may get scared around strangers, seem to live only in the present, and have to see something to know it exists. This makes them very easy to trick, if you're into that - I mean if you have any experience with babies, just think about this: toss a blanket over a six-month-old's pacifier and they think it vanished. They lack object permanence, the awareness that things still exist when they're out of sight. And yet, we develop so quickly that just a month or two later that baby already understands better that objects and people don't disappear just because they're hidden.

Object permanence, in Piaget's view, was one of the major achievements of the sensorimotor stage. The second of Piaget's phases of development is the 'preoperational stage' and he believed it began around age two, and carried on through age six or seven. The thing about kids of this age is that it's all about them. The preoperational stage is characterized by 'egocentrism' which drives most of what a child thinks and says. Kids have a hard time imagining another person's point of view, so much so that when I was a kid, if you asked me if I had a brother, I'd say, 'sure, John', but if you asked me if John had a brother I'd say, 'Nah, I don't think so.' Egocentrism of course never fully disappears, even in adults who understand how the whole sibling thing works.

The preoperational stage is also marked by a child's ability to mentally represent objects and events with words and images and pretend plays in their imagination. They're big into animism now, and believe their favorite bunny, batman or stuffed anglerfish has feelings and opinions and possibly the intent to kiss or kill you when you're asleep - depending on how they're feeling. Still plenty of kinks to work out. Piaget suggests that early in this stage, kids don't yet understand the concept of conservation - like how 500 milliliters is the same as 500 milliliters, no matter what container it's in. They can also struggle with the notion of reversibility. It's hard for them to mentally reverse the process by which a ball of clay smashed flat can be rolled back into a ball.

It's a concept that takes some time to understand. And these challenges both have to do with 'Centration' - a child's tendency to fixate on just one aspect of a problem or object - like the shape of the container or the clay. But during the second half of stage two, things begin to blossom. Kids start forming their theory of mind or ability to understand other people's feelings, thoughts and perceptions- as well as their own- and also how to predict behavior... like remember when my anglerfish got moved when I wasn't looking? A child at this stage will begin to realize that while she knows that the fish is in a new place, I don't know it was moved, so when I start to look for it, she'll expect me to look where it originally was and not where it was moved to.

These new people skills have all kinds of awesome applications from trying to convince your parents to "PLEASE GIVE ME THAT EXTRA COOKIE I SO DESPERATELY NEED!" to showing empathy, which is better - and offering comfort to others when they seem sad. Piaget called the third stage of development - beginning around age six or seven and lasting until eleven or twelve - the 'Concrete Operational Stage'. Kids are starting to think logically about concrete events that they've actually experienced. And unlike children in the earlier phase, getting hung up on issues of centration, kids in this stage experience 'decentration', and become able to see beyond just one aspect of an object or problem.

So now, problems with reversibility and conservation just cease to be problems. And the last of Piaget's four stages is the 'Formal Operational Stage' which starts at about twelve and carries us through the rest of our lives. By now, our reasoning is expanding to include more abstract thinking, problem solving and hypothetical questions. Now Piaget's four-stage model has been criticized for over-simplifying things and for being too rigid in how it classifies certain abilities by age. Today, for example, researchers have detected these phases at earlier ages than Piaget ever did - sometimes way earlier - like some types of object permanence have been observed in three-month-olds.

Psychologists also see development as more of a continuous process rather than a series of stepping stones. But even Piaget understood that his stages weren't as fixed as he made them sound. And he wasn't the only guy on the block talking about development. For instance, his contemporary, Belarussian psychologist Lev Vygotsky, had some ideas of his own. While Piaget focused on how a kid's mind grows by interacting with his physical environment, Vygotsky emphasized how early development occurs through parental instruction and interaction with social environments. He believed less in set stages and more in the idea that care-giver adults provide a sort of scaffolding, that helps children climb to higher levels of thinking and learning.

Vgotsky put a lot of emphasis on language as a way of assigning meaning to things, and he also suggested that the ways kids develop might actually vary across cultures. In the end, there's room for lots of different theories here, but perhaps Piaget's greatest achievement was developing theoretical depth in the concept that kids actually think very differently than adults. This fact has helped a lot of parents and teachers, and his work spurred a new era of research in the field. While Piaget wasn't the only developmentalist, or even the first, he's definitely one of the most influential, and remains relevant to this day. As the brain and mind develop in children, so too do their social, emotional, and moral

behavior. How a child is raised and cared for can have a profound impact on their personality later in life, which is something we'll look at next week. This week, though, you learned how we use schemas, assimilation, and accommodation to make sense of the world around us, and about Piaget's four-stage theory of cognitive development, including sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational periods, and about Vgotsky's theory of scaffolding.

### Transcript (reading)

So you’ve probably seen a little kid react to a sudden bang or a terrifying clown or some strange Santa at the mall, right? Yeah, not pretty. That child probably immediately reached for a parent, looking for comfort, and that same kid might freak out if she was separated from her adult of choice, especially is she was in an unfamiliar environment. It’s called attachment and if you’ve ever seen a clingy kid you know why it’s called that. They attach. For a long time psychologists assumed that this was just an intense innate survival instinct; I mean it makes sense that babies would be attached to their food source and bigger kids would stick around to the people who helped them survive.

But in the 1950s American psychologists Harry and Margaret Harlow came along with a barrel of monkeys, complicating and illuminating our idea of bonding with caregivers in what has to be one of the saddest psychological experiments of all time. The Harlow’s were breeding Rhesus macaque monkeys for their research on learning. Part of the process involved separating babies from their mothers right after birth, which, yeah, pretty cruel already. They began noticing that baby monkeys were very attached to the blankets they had in their cages, so they set up an experiment. They created two artificial mothers. One was a bare wire cylinder with a feeding bottle attached; they called that Wire Mother, and the other was a cozier cloth and foam wrapped cylinder without a feeding bottle:

Cloth Mother. It took no time at all to see the baby’s preference. They overwhelming preferred the comfy cloth mama, clinging to it whenever they seemed to be anxious or in need of comfort, and sometimes they fed from the Wire Mother with the baby bottle while standing on the cloth one. This discovery that attachment wasn’t just about getting breakfast surprised a lot of people. It turns out that contact and touch are vital to attachment, learning, emotional well-being, and psychological development. As the brain and mind develop in infants so too do they’re emotions and social behavior. Caregivers can greatly influence this development, and most psychologists will tell you that how a child is raised early on can have a huge effect on how they view the world, other

people and themselves, not to mention how they react to stressful situations or sort out moral dilemmas. I mean, it’s a big complex challenging world out there and wire monkey baby mama just ain’t gonna cut it. [Intro] Touch. You can convey all sorts of emotions through touch. A hug, a slap, a pat on the back, a poke on the side all convey meaning. Babies learn a lot through touch. It’s how they feel security and trust. You can imagine how all those poor macaques, who were separated not just from their mothers, but everyone, grew up to have some social issues as adults. That is maybe putting it too mildly. Those monkeys showed many signs of being really disturbed, from trouble eating, to rocking back and forth in a trance, to even engaging in self-mutilation.

Most of the macaques used in this study never recovered, and those who were forced into pregnancy didn't know how to care for their own offspring. Although the Harlow's research taught us a lot, it was inhumane and would never pass today's ethical standards. Monkeys, like humans, need to be loved. And loving touch and care are tremendously important, but familiarity is also key to attachment. When you're little, a hug from a stranger is not the same as a hug from your mom or your grandma or your dad or your zookeeper or whomever you're most comfortable and familiar with. The unfamiliar can cause anxiety. And for some critters, all these factors need to come together sooner rather than later.

Some baby animals experience a critical period in early life when certain things have to happen for normal development to occur. For ducks and geese, that critical period occurs just after hatching when they accept the first moving object they see as their mother. This so-called "imprinting process" can be difficult to reverse, which can make things a bit awkward if that moving thing is a golden retriever or a person or a beach ball. Thankfully, human babies don't imprint. The world would be a lot different and a lot more bizarre if they did. Human babies do, however, feel a lot more comfortable around people, things, and settings that they're familiar with. They form emotional attachments, but not all attachments are created equal.

In the 1970's, American psychologist Mary Ainsworth created the "strange situation" experiment to observe children's different attachment styles. She'd put a one-year-old kid and their mom in an unfamiliar room, like a playroom at the lab and then observe the child playing with the mother. Eventually, the child would encounter something potentially stressful. Like, a stranger would come in and interact with the child and then the mom would leave. If the kid freaked out, the stranger would try to comfort them. And then mom would come back and the stranger would leave. Different children responded differently to the strange situation. Ainsworth measured and observed 4 different categories of behavior, including separation

anxiety, the child's willingness to explore, stranger anxiety, and reunion behavior, or how the child reacted when the mom returned, which was what she was particularly interested in. Ainsworth broke this behavior down into three main attachment styles: secure, insecure avoidant, and insecure ambivalent. About 70% of her subjects showed secure attachment and could happily explore their new digs and interact with the stranger, so long as their mom was nearby. If mom left, they might freak out a bit, but they greeted her return in a happy and positive way. About 15% of the kids demonstrated insecure ambivalent attachment. They were afraid of the stranger, cried more and explored less, and had a major freak out when mom left, only to act all salty and mad when she returned.

The last 15% or so showed insecure avoidant attachment. They were fine with the stranger, kinda indifferent actually, didn't cling to mom, didn't seem bothered when she left, showed little interest upon her return. Ainsworth observed that sensitive, attentive mothers usually raised securely attached kids, whereas less responsive mothers who often ignored their children, or super-anxious mothers who obsessed over every little thing, often raised insecurely attached toddlers. And then of course, on the extreme, the poor monkeys with their unresponsive, fake moms, they became absolutely terrified in unfamiliar situations. Attachment is vital. It builds the foundation for our sense of basic trust and quite possibly for our adult

relationships, our motivation to achieve and our willingness to be bold, like that toddler playing with new toys in a strange room. Given what those messed-up monkeys taught us, it should be no surprise that disruptions in attachment can bring a world of pain. Babies raised under abuse or extreme neglect are often withdrawn and frightened, and many parents who've engaged in abusive behavior were abused themselves as children. Young kids exposed to extended abuse, trauma, and neglect are at higher risk for psychological disorders, health problems, and substance abuse as adults. Studies of children raised in understaffed Romanian orphanages, for example, found that they scored lower in cognitive tests and were twice as likely to exhibit symptoms of anxiety

as their counterparts raised in quality foster homes. It's certainly true that some kids can show remarkable resilience, but disrupted attachment and care, often further complicated by social and economic marginalization of all kinds, can leave life-long scars. So if one of infancy's major social achievements is forming positive attachments, then one of the biggest achievements in childhood would have to be achieving a positive sense of self. This self-concept, or an understanding and evaluation of who we are, is usually pretty solid by about the time we turn 12. Charles Darwin proposed that our self-awareness begins when we can recognize ourselves in a mirror. This self-recognition typically doesn't occur in humans under 15 to 18 months.

And by the time that tot's heading to kindergarten, their self-concept is rapidly expanding. They probably know their age, hair color, and family name. Perhaps they know they're good at drawing and not so good at tree climbing, and they're noticing the differences and similarities they share with other people. Kids with positive self-images are more happy, confident, independent, and sociable. So, how can we instill these values and security in kids? And how does parenting affect development? Whether your parents were aloof or affectionate, strict or lax, and whether they spanked you or preferred to talk it out, one model of parenting would probably categorize them into one of three major styles, all related to control.

The authoritarian parent makes rules with consequences and expects you to follow them because "I said so!" and tends to not be very warm to their child. Whereas the permissive parent often caves to their child's demands and exerts little control over any of the child's behavior. The authoritative parent, meanwhile, seeks to find a balance between the two. They are demanding, but always explain the reasons for their rules, and are loving and responsive. And, of course, research indicates that finding that culturally appropriate sweet-spot between too hard and too soft is the best way to go. Now, in addition to that growing sense of self, two other important landmarks of childhood and adolescence are the ability to discern right from wrong and the formation of individual character.

When those two things combine, they give us morality. Last week, we talked about Jean Piaget and his three-tiered model for cognitive development. Well, American psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg modified and expanded on that, and blew it up into his own three-level theory of moral development, which emphasized the notion that our moral reasoning continues to develop throughout our lives. Kohlberg outlined his theory by posing a series of moral dilemmas to children, teens, and adults, and then analyzing their reasoning behind the judgments. One of his most famous questions is known as the Heinz Dilemma. A woman is dying of cancer; there's a special new drug that might save her, but the pharmacist wants to make a big profit, so he charges a lot of money for it.

Her husband, Heinz, can't afford it and has tried everything, from fundraising to begging the pharmacist, to no avail. So, he steals the drug. Was he wrong? Kohlberg was less interested in people's answers than in the reasoning behind their choice. He ended up organizing his subjects' responses into three basic levels of moral thinking. Kohlberg found that if the subject was younger than nine, they were likely in what he called the preconventional morality phase. In this phase, kids are concerned with self-interest, but they're also starting to judge people individually, based on their needs and point of view. So, Heinz needed the medicine, and stealing it best served his needs.

But in the second phase, in early adolescence, our moral compasses seem to shift, during what Kohlberg called the conventional morality phase. Here, his subjects put an emphasis on conformity and worry about what would happen to Heinz if he was seen as a criminal. This phase seems to worry "what would people think?". From adolescence on, Kohlberg believes, some people exist in the postconventional morality phase. This is a more complex adult morality, when we begin to account for differing values and basic rights. Laws are important, but some situations, like saving your beloved's life, might overrule them. This phase tops out with reasoning based on universal ethical principles and more abstract reasoning.

Heinz was right to steal the medicine because people have a right to live. Critics of Kohlberg's set up question his emphasis on moral thinking rather than moral action, arguing that there's a big difference between reasoning out what you should do and actually doing it. But one thing's for sure, what we experience during our first years on this planet, the nature and quality of our attachments, our sense of self, and our moral development, they all set the stage of our adolescence and adulthood. Today, your developing brain learned about Ainsworth's three styles of secure, insecure avoidant, and insecure ambivalent attachment. And about authoritarian, permissive, and authoritative parenting styles.

You also learned about developing self-concept and Kohlberg's stages of morality. Thanks for watching, especially to all of our Subbable subscribers who make Crash Course possible.

### Transcript (navigation)

- [00:00] So you’ve probably seen a little kid react to a sudden bang or a terrifying clown or
- [00:04] some strange Santa at the mall, right?
- [00:07] Yeah, not pretty.
- [00:08] That child probably immediately reached for a parent, looking for comfort, and that same
- [00:12] kid might freak out if she was separated from her adult of choice, especially is she was
- [00:17] in an unfamiliar environment.
- [00:18] It’s called attachment and if you’ve ever seen a clingy kid you know why it’s called
- [00:22] that.
- [00:23] They attach.
- [00:24] For a long time psychologists assumed that this was just an intense innate survival instinct;
- [00:28] I mean it makes sense that babies would be attached to their food source and bigger kids
- [00:32] would stick around to the people who helped them survive.
- [00:34] But in the 1950s American psychologists Harry and Margaret Harlow came along with a barrel
- [00:38] of monkeys, complicating and illuminating our idea of bonding with caregivers in what
- [00:43] has to be one of the saddest psychological experiments of all time.
- [00:47] The Harlow’s were breeding Rhesus macaque monkeys for their research on learning.
- [00:51] Part of the process involved separating babies from their mothers right after birth, which,
- [00:56] yeah, pretty cruel already.
- [00:57] They began noticing that baby monkeys were very attached to the blankets they had in
- [01:02] their cages, so they set up an experiment.
- [01:04] They created two artificial mothers.
- [01:07] One was a bare wire cylinder with a feeding bottle attached; they called that Wire Mother,
- [01:11] and the other was a cozier cloth and foam wrapped cylinder without a feeding bottle:
- [01:16] Cloth Mother.
- [01:17] It took no time at all to see the baby’s preference.
- [01:19] They overwhelming preferred the comfy cloth mama, clinging to it whenever they seemed
- [01:24] to be anxious or in need of comfort, and sometimes they fed from the Wire Mother with the baby
- [01:29] bottle while standing on the cloth one.
- [01:31] This discovery that attachment wasn’t just about getting breakfast surprised a lot of
- [01:35] people.
- [01:36] It turns out that contact and touch are vital to attachment, learning, emotional well-being,
- [01:40] and psychological development.
- [01:42] As the brain and mind develop in infants so too do they’re emotions and social behavior.
- [01:47] Caregivers can greatly influence this development, and most psychologists will tell you that
- [01:51] how a child is raised early on can have a huge effect on how they view the world, other
- [01:55] people and themselves, not to mention how they react to stressful situations or sort
- [02:00] out moral dilemmas.
- [02:01] I mean, it’s a big complex challenging world out there and wire monkey baby mama just ain’t
- [02:07] gonna cut it.
- [02:11] [Intro]
- [02:14] Touch.
- [02:18] You can convey all sorts of emotions through touch.
- [02:20] A hug, a slap, a pat on the back, a poke on the side all convey meaning.
- [02:25] Babies learn a lot through touch.
- [02:26] It’s how they feel security and trust.
- [02:29] You can imagine how all those poor macaques, who were separated not just from their mothers,
- [02:33] but everyone, grew up to have some social issues as adults.
- [02:37] That is maybe putting it too mildly.
- [02:39] Those monkeys showed many signs of being really disturbed, from trouble eating, to rocking
- [02:43] back and forth in a trance, to even engaging in self-mutilation.
- [02:45] Most of the macaques used in this study never recovered, and those who were forced into
- [02:50] pregnancy didn't know how to care for their own offspring.
- [02:53] Although the Harlow's research taught us a lot, it was inhumane and would never pass
- [02:57] today's ethical standards.
- [02:59] Monkeys, like humans, need to be loved.
- [03:02] And loving touch and care are tremendously important, but familiarity is also key to
- [03:07] attachment.
- [03:08] When you're little, a hug from a stranger is not the same as a hug from your mom or
- [03:10] your grandma or your dad or your zookeeper or whomever you're most comfortable and familiar
- [03:15] with.
- [03:16] The unfamiliar can cause anxiety.
- [03:17] And for some critters, all these factors need to come together sooner rather than later.
- [03:21] Some baby animals experience a critical period in early life when certain things have to
- [03:25] happen for normal development to occur.
- [03:27] For ducks and geese, that critical period occurs just after hatching when they accept
- [03:31] the first moving object they see as their mother.
- [03:33] This so-called "imprinting process" can be difficult to reverse, which can make things
- [03:37] a bit awkward if that moving thing is a golden retriever or a person or a beach ball.
- [03:42] Thankfully, human babies don't imprint.
- [03:44] The world would be a lot different and a lot more bizarre if they did.
- [03:48] Human babies do, however, feel a lot more comfortable around people, things, and settings
- [03:51] that they're familiar with.
- [03:53] They form emotional attachments, but not all attachments are created equal.
- [03:57] In the 1970's, American psychologist Mary Ainsworth created the "strange situation"
- [04:02] experiment to observe children's different attachment styles.
- [04:05] She'd put a one-year-old kid and their mom in an unfamiliar room, like a playroom at
- [04:09] the lab and then observe the child playing with the mother.
- [04:12] Eventually, the child would encounter something potentially stressful.
- [04:15] Like, a stranger would come in and interact with the child and then the mom would leave.
- [04:18] If the kid freaked out, the stranger would try to comfort them.
- [04:21] And then mom would come back and the stranger would leave.
- [04:24] Different children responded differently to the strange situation.
- [04:27] Ainsworth measured and observed 4 different categories of behavior, including separation
- [04:31] anxiety, the child's willingness to explore, stranger anxiety, and reunion behavior, or
- [04:36] how the child reacted when the mom returned, which was what she was particularly interested
- [04:40] in.
- [04:41] Ainsworth broke this behavior down into three main attachment styles: secure, insecure avoidant,
- [04:46] and insecure ambivalent.
- [04:47] About 70% of her subjects showed secure attachment and could happily explore their new digs and
- [04:52] interact with the stranger, so long as their mom was nearby.
- [04:55] If mom left, they might freak out a bit, but they greeted her return in a happy and positive
- [05:00] way.
- [05:01] About 15% of the kids demonstrated insecure ambivalent attachment.
- [05:04] They were afraid of the stranger, cried more and explored less, and had a major freak out
- [05:09] when mom left, only to act all salty and mad when she returned.
- [05:13] The last 15% or so showed insecure avoidant attachment.
- [05:17] They were fine with the stranger, kinda indifferent actually, didn't cling to mom, didn't seem
- [05:22] bothered when she left, showed little interest upon her return.
- [05:25] Ainsworth observed that sensitive, attentive mothers usually raised securely attached kids,
- [05:30] whereas less responsive mothers who often ignored their children, or super-anxious mothers
- [05:34] who obsessed over every little thing, often raised insecurely attached toddlers.
- [05:38] And then of course, on the extreme, the poor monkeys with their unresponsive, fake moms,
- [05:44] they became absolutely terrified in unfamiliar situations.
- [05:48] Attachment is vital.
- [05:49] It builds the foundation for our sense of basic trust and quite possibly for our adult
- [05:54] relationships, our motivation to achieve and our willingness to be bold, like that toddler
- [05:59] playing with new toys in a strange room.
- [06:01] Given what those messed-up monkeys taught us, it should be no surprise that disruptions
- [06:04] in attachment can bring a world of pain.
- [06:07] Babies raised under abuse or extreme neglect are often withdrawn and frightened, and many
- [06:11] parents who've engaged in abusive behavior were abused themselves as children.
- [06:15] Young kids exposed to extended abuse, trauma, and neglect are at higher risk for psychological
- [06:20] disorders, health problems, and substance abuse as adults.
- [06:23] Studies of children raised in understaffed Romanian orphanages, for example, found that
- [06:27] they scored lower in cognitive tests and were twice as likely to exhibit symptoms of anxiety
- [06:32] as their counterparts raised in quality foster homes.
- [06:35] It's certainly true that some kids can show remarkable resilience, but disrupted attachment
- [06:39] and care, often further complicated by social and economic marginalization of all kinds,
- [06:44] can leave life-long scars.
- [06:45] So if one of infancy's major social achievements is forming positive attachments, then one
- [06:50] of the biggest achievements in childhood would have to be achieving a positive sense of self.
- [06:55] This self-concept, or an understanding and evaluation of who we are, is usually pretty
- [06:59] solid by about the time we turn 12.
- [07:02] Charles Darwin proposed that our self-awareness begins when we can recognize ourselves in
- [07:06] a mirror.
- [07:07] This self-recognition typically doesn't occur in humans under 15 to 18 months.
- [07:10] And by the time that tot's heading to kindergarten, their self-concept is rapidly expanding.
- [07:15] They probably know their age, hair color, and family name.
- [07:18] Perhaps they know they're good at drawing and not so good at tree climbing, and they're
- [07:22] noticing the differences and similarities they share with other people.
- [07:25] Kids with positive self-images are more happy, confident, independent, and sociable.
- [07:29] So, how can we instill these values and security in kids?
- [07:34] And how does parenting affect development?
- [07:36] Whether your parents were aloof or affectionate, strict or lax, and whether they spanked you
- [07:40] or preferred to talk it out, one model of parenting would probably categorize them into

### Transcript (reading)

So far in our exploration of how the mind grows, we've talked about a lot of different philosophies and models and ways of looking at things. But here's a surprisingly useful tool for understanding developmental psychology: The Breakfast Club. This video, by the way, will contain Breakfast Club spoilers. That classic 80s movie about a band of teenagers stuck in detention one fateful Saturday morning. Do they do Saturday detentions anymore? That was never a "thing" at my school. That was crazy, the idea that kids would come in on a weekend for detention. You got the hoodlum, the jock, the nerd, the princess, and the so-called basketcase, And at first, they're all salty and standoffish with each other.

Because you know, let's face it, American high schools are sort of a breeding ground for that kind of thing. But as the day progresses, they start to open up and share things and have a little fun by way of a dance montage. And at some point they each kind of crack, revealing something very important about adolescence in the process, which is - The struggle between the need to stand out, and the need to belong. All these kids feel tremendous pressure to maintain their image in their particular group in part because there's just some security in belonging to a group, even if that group gets picked on by another group. And so they wear the corresponding diamond earrings, combat boots, lettermans jackets, and spectacles, and act how their roles dictate.

But the thing is, none of those kids are satisfied with their outward identities. Instead, they're all stuck in the classic teenage struggle, one that German psychoanalyst Erik Erikson - yes, his name is actually Erik Erikson - called the crisis between identity and role confusion. In other words, their newly-forming identities were at odds with other people's expectations of what roles they should play, hence the confusion. The past couple weeks, we've been talking about childhood as a crucial period of growth, learning, and change, and it definitely is, but anyone who's ever seen a John Hughes movie knows that there's way more to growing up than just that. And I got some news for you - from adolescence into adulthood and into old age,

the drama of your personal psychological development never ceases. Never! So get used to it. [INTRO] Today, most psychologists view our psychological development as a lifelong process from infant, to adolescent, to adult, to card-carrying senior citizen, people keep right on changing. Just as Piaget gave us a helpful framework for thinking about early development, other scholars have given us ideas about how we develop through the rest of our lives, particularly Erik Erikson. Like many others, Erikson believed our personalities develop in a predetermined order, which he outlined in an eight-stage model. And each stage, from infancy to old age, is defined by its own predominant issue or crisis.

If it freaks you out to think that you will always be dealing with a crisis at every stage of your life, we can just call them "issues." Since we already talked a lot about early childhood development, I'm gonna skip ahead to the teenage meat of it. But you can consult this table to learn about the rest. Erikson defined the adolescent years, or "Stage 5," as starting in our teens, and extending for some as far as our early twenties. And as The Breakfast Club so artfully depicted, its main crisis is the one of identity vs. role confusion. Teen years are marked by lots of physical changes in the body and brain and sex hormones, along with growing independence, but also a real need to belong to something.

This often angsty time is when teens reexamine their identities, figuring out how to both blend in and how to stand out, often by trying on different roles. Maybe they're experimenting with punk rock, or hockey, or theater, or ancient philosophy. Maybe sophomore year they're preppy. Junior year they've got green hair. Hopefully a person comes out of this stage with a reintegrated sense of self, but this stage can be particularly confusing as I'm sure anybody watching this video can attest to. But of course, that's not the last crisis - sorry, "issue." Erikson believed that young adulthood, which in his view, started in a person's 20s and ended as late as the early 40s, was marked by another struggle, one between intimacy and isolation.

By this stage in life, most of us have begun exploring intimate relationships, whether that's with a steady sweetheart, or just an active OkCupid profile. A good relationship here can lead to feelings of safety and caring and commitment, while a lack of intimacy can lead to loneliness and isolation and depression. Recently, a number of psychologists have begun to refer to the first few years of this stage as emerging adulthood, and some suggest that it warrants its own classification distinct from adolescence or full adulthood. And at least in modern western culture, many people in this stage do feel like they're stuck in a sort of in-between time. They know that they've pulled through all that high school stuff, but they're still pretty tied to their families.

In 2011, the U.S. Census found that 65% of people under 24 still live with their parents. Just a reminder of how things like economic factors can weigh on development. For Erikson, after young adulthood came the middle adulthood of our 40s to 60s. This stage, Stage 7, highlights our tendency toward either generativity or stagnation. By now, many people have established jobs or careers or perhaps families of their own. We better understand the bigger picture of life and contribute to society through productive, or generative, activities like work, community involvement, raising kids, paying taxes, all that grown-up stuff. The lack of those things, an overall boredom or absence of purpose, can make Stage 7-ers feel stagnant and unproductive,

hence the often cliched, but really real and potentially painful, mid-life crisis. And finally, at the end, comes Stage 8. In our late adulthood, from 65 and up, we often struggle with integrity vs. despair. Maybe you've hung out with a grandparent or some other senior and heard them contemplating their lives and accomplishments and reminiscing about how cheap a milkshake used to be. Well, if their overall vibe is positive, they've probably developed a sense of integrity and completeness, meaning they're pretty satisfied with a life well lived. The flip side of that is looking back on life and feeling guilt and regret, and that kind of retrospective disappointment can ruin old age with depression and feelings of hopelessness.

Again, Erikson's model isn't really a perfect contemporary one, but it gave us an early idea of conflict and growth over our whole lives. His ideas have been developed further and even challenged by other scholars, but like Piaget, he remains a crucial figure to know in Western psychology. So Erikson tackled our progressive psychosocial development, but what exactly happens to our bodies and brains after we hit adulthood and keep racking up the birthday cake candles? It's hard to generalize these stages of adulthood because we don't really hit yearly milestones like we did when we were kids, and adult lifestyles can vary a whole lot. I mean, in a lot of ways, 70-year-old Mick Jagger's still living a younger lifestyle than a lot of 20-somethings I know.

But despite all our differences, many of our life courses do have some similarities -- physically, cognitively, and socially. First, there are, yes, physical changes: the slow decline of reaction time, muscle tone, and strength, cardiac output, sex hormone production, and sharpness of senses like hearing and sight. For most of us, bifocals are inevitable, and perhaps hearing aids as well. None of this is to say that a jacked 50-year-old couldn't beat a lazy 20-year-old on a 100-meter dash, because, of course, how well you take care of your body counts for a lot. But still, you can't stop, let alone reverse the process of aging. The good news is our intelligence remains pretty stable throughout adulthood.

Although some people might feel that their wits get a bit fuzzy with age, research suggests that while one kind of intelligence decreases after adolescence, another kind keeps increasing throughout your lifetime. Psychologists Raymond Cattell and John Horn were the first to develop the concepts of fluid and crystallized intelligence, suggesting that intelligence itself is made up of different abilities that work together. Fluid intelligence deals with your ability to solve problems independent of your personal experience and education. It's typically associated with thinking both quickly and abstractly, like teasing out the logic of a puzzle, rather than remembering how to find the cosine of an angle.

So relatively inexperienced teens often show high fluid intelligence. The bummer is it peaks in adolescence, then typically starts its slow decline in the 30s... So I'm experiencing that now... Crystallized intelligence, on the other hand, is just what it sounds like: knowledge that's based on facts, solidified by past experiences and prior learning. This type of experiential intelligence gets stronger with age, as we continue to take in new knowledge and understanding, and it's part of why grandmas are so good at crossword puzzles! Both fluid and crystallized intelligence are equally important on any given day, and ideally, they work together to get the job of thinking done.

So in the end, some of our thinking gets rusty with age, but some of it keeps getting better. Of course, there are exceptions. While most people who live into their 90s are still pretty sharp, some will experience a substantial loss of brain cells and suffer serious consequences. Brain tumors, small strokes, or continued alcohol dependence can all progressively damage the brain, increasing the risk of dementia. Dementia isn't a specific disease, but rather a set of symptoms related to impaired thinking, memory loss, confusion, and potential changes in personality that become severe enough to interfere with regular functioning. Alzheimer's disease is a form of progressive, irreversible dementia.

First, memory declines, then reasoning, and then eventually basic physiological functions as vital brain neurons continue to deteriorate. It strikes about 3% of the world's population before age 75, although from there, the rate roughly doubles every five years. But again, not all dementia is related to Alzheimer's disease, nor is it as extreme. And while the risk of dementia certainly increases in older adults, it's important to remember that it is not part of normal, healthy aging. Some memory changes are normal, but most memories should remain intact. In the end, we still have a lot to learn about the aging process. As our lifespans continue to get longer, we might need to tweak what we think we know about its effects on human psychology.

In some ways, you might say that this is psychology's next frontier. By the time we figure out what that looks like, the cast of The Breakfast Club might just be ready for a reunion... and they'd better make a movie about it. Today, your developing brain learned about Erikson's eight stages of progressive psychosocial development and their accompanying issues. You also learned about emerging adulthood, the differences between fluid and crystalline intelligence, and some facts about dementia and Alzheimer's disease.

### Transcript (navigation)

- [00:00] So far in our exploration of how the mind grows,
- [00:03] we've talked about a lot of different philosophies and models and ways of looking at things.
- [00:07] But here's a surprisingly useful tool for understanding developmental psychology:
- [00:11] The Breakfast Club. This video, by the way, will contain Breakfast Club spoilers.
- [00:15] That classic 80s movie about a band of teenagers
- [00:18] stuck in detention one fateful Saturday morning.
- [00:20] Do they do Saturday detentions anymore?
- [00:23] That was never a "thing" at my school.
- [00:25] That was crazy, the idea that kids would come in on a weekend for detention.
- [00:29] You got the hoodlum, the jock, the nerd, the princess, and the so-called basketcase,
- [00:33] And at first, they're all salty and standoffish with each other.
- [00:36] Because you know, let's face it, American high schools are sort of a breeding ground for that kind of thing.
- [00:39] But as the day progresses, they start to open up and share things
- [00:42] and have a little fun by way of a dance montage.
- [00:45] And at some point they each kind of crack, revealing something very important
- [00:48] about adolescence in the process, which is -
- [00:51] The struggle between the need to stand out, and the need to belong.
- [00:54] All these kids feel tremendous pressure to maintain their image in their particular group
- [00:59] in part because there's just some security in belonging to a group,
- [01:02] even if that group gets picked on by another group.
- [01:05] And so they wear the corresponding diamond earrings,
- [01:07] combat boots, lettermans jackets, and spectacles, and act how their roles dictate.
- [01:12] But the thing is, none of those kids are satisfied with their outward identities.
- [01:16] Instead, they're all stuck in the classic teenage struggle,
- [01:19] one that German psychoanalyst Erik Erikson -
- [01:21] yes, his name is actually Erik Erikson -
- [01:23] called the crisis between identity and role confusion.
- [01:27] In other words, their newly-forming identities were at odds
- [01:30] with other people's expectations of what roles they should play, hence the confusion.
- [01:34] The past couple weeks, we've been talking about childhood as
- [01:37] a crucial period of growth, learning, and change, and it definitely is,
- [01:41] but anyone who's ever seen a John Hughes movie knows
- [01:43] that there's way more to growing up than just that.
- [01:46] And I got some news for you -
- [01:48] from adolescence into adulthood and into old age,
- [01:51] the drama of your personal psychological development never ceases.
- [01:54] Never! So get used to it.
- [01:57] [INTRO]
- [02:06] Today, most psychologists view our psychological development as a lifelong process
- [02:10] from infant, to adolescent, to adult,
- [02:12] to card-carrying senior citizen, people keep right on changing.
- [02:16] Just as Piaget gave us a helpful framework for thinking about early development,
- [02:20] other scholars have given us ideas about how we develop
- [02:23] through the rest of our lives, particularly Erik Erikson.
- [02:26] Like many others, Erikson believed our personalities develop in a predetermined order,
- [02:30] which he outlined in an eight-stage model.
- [02:32] And each stage, from infancy to old age, is defined by
- [02:35] its own predominant issue or crisis.
- [02:38] If it freaks you out to think that you will always be dealing with a crisis
- [02:41] at every stage of your life, we can just call them "issues."
- [02:44] Since we already talked a lot about early childhood development,
- [02:47] I'm gonna skip ahead to the teenage meat of it.
- [02:49] But you can consult this table to learn about the rest.
- [02:52] Erikson defined the adolescent years, or "Stage 5,"
- [02:54] as starting in our teens, and extending for some as far as our early twenties.
- [02:58] And as The Breakfast Club so artfully depicted,
- [03:01] its main crisis is the one of identity vs. role confusion.
- [03:04] Teen years are marked by lots of physical changes
- [03:07] in the body and brain and sex hormones, along with growing independence,
- [03:11] but also a real need to belong to something.
- [03:14] This often angsty time is when teens reexamine their identities,
- [03:18] figuring out how to both blend in and how to stand out,
- [03:21] often by trying on different roles.
- [03:23] Maybe they're experimenting with punk rock,
- [03:25] or hockey, or theater, or ancient philosophy.
- [03:28] Maybe sophomore year they're preppy. Junior year they've got green hair.
- [03:31] Hopefully a person comes out of this stage with a reintegrated sense of self,
- [03:34] but this stage can be particularly confusing as I'm sure anybody watching this video can attest to.
- [03:39] But of course, that's not the last crisis - sorry, "issue."
- [03:43] Erikson believed that young adulthood, which in his view,
- [03:45] started in a person's 20s and ended as late as the early 40s,
- [03:49] was marked by another struggle, one between intimacy and isolation.
- [03:52] By this stage in life, most of us have begun exploring intimate relationships,
- [03:56] whether that's with a steady sweetheart, or just an active OkCupid profile.
- [03:59] A good relationship here can lead to feelings of safety and caring and commitment,
- [04:03] while a lack of intimacy can lead to loneliness and isolation and depression.
- [04:06] Recently, a number of psychologists have begun to refer to the first few years of this stage as
- [04:10] emerging adulthood, and some suggest that it warrants its own classification
- [04:14] distinct from adolescence or full adulthood.
- [04:17] And at least in modern western culture, many people in this stage
- [04:20] do feel like they're stuck in a sort of in-between time.
- [04:23] They know that they've pulled through all that high school stuff, but they're still pretty tied to their families.
- [04:26] In 2011, the U.S. Census found that 65% of people under 24 still live with their parents.
- [04:32] Just a reminder of how things like economic factors can weigh on development.
- [04:35] For Erikson, after young adulthood came the middle adulthood of our 40s to 60s.
- [04:40] This stage, Stage 7, highlights our tendency toward either generativity or stagnation.
- [04:45] By now, many people have established jobs or careers or perhaps families of their own.
- [04:49] We better understand the bigger picture of life and contribute to society
- [04:52] through productive, or generative, activities
- [04:54] like work, community involvement, raising kids, paying taxes, all that grown-up stuff.
- [04:59] The lack of those things, an overall boredom or absence of purpose,
- [05:02] can make Stage 7-ers feel stagnant and unproductive,
- [05:06] hence the often cliched, but really real and potentially painful, mid-life crisis.
- [05:10] And finally, at the end, comes Stage 8.
- [05:13] In our late adulthood, from 65 and up, we often struggle with integrity vs. despair.
- [05:18] Maybe you've hung out with a grandparent or some other senior and heard them contemplating
- [05:21] their lives and accomplishments and reminiscing about how cheap a milkshake used to be.
- [05:25] Well, if their overall vibe is positive,
- [05:28] they've probably developed a sense of integrity and completeness,
- [05:31] meaning they're pretty satisfied with a life well lived.
- [05:33] The flip side of that is looking back on life and feeling guilt and regret, and that kind of
- [05:37] retrospective disappointment can ruin old age with depression and feelings of hopelessness.
- [05:41] Again, Erikson's model isn't really a perfect contemporary one,
- [05:45] but it gave us an early idea of conflict and growth over our whole lives.
- [05:49] His ideas have been developed further and even challenged by other scholars,
- [05:53] but like Piaget, he remains a crucial figure to know in Western psychology.
- [05:57] So Erikson tackled our progressive psychosocial development,
- [06:00] but what exactly happens to our bodies and brains after we hit adulthood
- [06:04] and keep racking up the birthday cake candles?
- [06:06] It's hard to generalize these stages of adulthood because
- [06:08] we don't really hit yearly milestones like we did when we were kids,
- [06:11] and adult lifestyles can vary a whole lot. I mean, in a lot of ways,
- [06:14] 70-year-old Mick Jagger's still living a younger lifestyle than a lot of 20-somethings I know.
- [06:18] But despite all our differences, many of our life courses do have some similarities --
- [06:22] physically, cognitively, and socially.
- [06:24] First, there are, yes, physical changes:
- [06:26] the slow decline of reaction time, muscle tone, and strength,
- [06:29] cardiac output, sex hormone production,
- [06:32] and sharpness of senses like hearing and sight.
- [06:34] For most of us, bifocals are inevitable, and perhaps hearing aids as well.
- [06:38] None of this is to say that a jacked 50-year-old couldn't beat a lazy 20-year-old on a 100-meter dash,
- [06:43] because, of course, how well you take care of your body counts for a lot.
- [06:46] But still, you can't stop, let alone reverse the process of aging.
- [06:50] The good news is our intelligence remains pretty stable throughout adulthood.
- [06:54] Although some people might feel that their wits get a bit fuzzy with age,
- [06:57] research suggests that while one kind of intelligence decreases after adolescence,
- [07:01] another kind keeps increasing throughout your lifetime.
- [07:04] Psychologists Raymond Cattell and John Horn were the first to develop the concepts of
- [07:07] fluid and crystallized intelligence, suggesting that
- [07:10] intelligence itself is made up of different abilities that work together.
- [07:14] Fluid intelligence deals with your ability to solve problems
- [07:17] independent of your personal experience and education.
- [07:19] It's typically associated with thinking both quickly and abstractly,
- [07:23] like teasing out the logic of a puzzle, rather than
- [07:25] remembering how to find the cosine of an angle.
- [07:28] So relatively inexperienced teens often show high fluid intelligence.
- [07:32] The bummer is it peaks in adolescence,
- [07:35] then typically starts its slow decline in the 30s...
- [07:38] So I'm experiencing that now...
- [07:40] Crystallized intelligence, on the other hand, is just what it sounds like:
- [07:43] knowledge that's based on facts, solidified by past experiences and prior learning.
- [07:47] This type of experiential intelligence gets stronger with age,
- [07:50] as we continue to take in new knowledge and understanding,
- [07:53] and it's part of why grandmas are so good at crossword puzzles!
- [07:56] Both fluid and crystallized intelligence are equally important on any given day,
- [08:00] and ideally, they work together to get the job of thinking done.
- [08:04] So in the end, some of our thinking gets rusty with age, but some of it keeps getting better.
- [08:09] Of course, there are exceptions.
- [08:11] While most people who live into their 90s are still pretty sharp,
- [08:14] some will experience a substantial loss of brain cells and suffer serious consequences.
- [08:19] Brain tumors, small strokes, or continued alcohol dependence
- [08:22] can all progressively damage the brain, increasing the risk of dementia.

Did you know that astronauts in space have a hard time communicating without words because their weightless bodily fluids make their faces all puffy and hard to read? Have you heard that Botox can actually improve your mood, and not by smoothing wrinkles but actually by easing depression? Or that this "come here" gesture is common in the US but is considered so rude in the Philippines that it could actually get you arrested. Yeah. All true! Emotions and the ways we express them are strange and powerful things. And emotions aren't just ephemeral psychological phenomena, they affect our bodies and our health. Because so many emotions have a certain contagious quality, our feelings and the behaviors they drive also affect the minds, and bodies, and health of those around us.

This is true whether your emotions of the moment are of the feel-good variety. Or not. The powers of both positivity and negativity are stronger than you may know. Lots of studies have shown that people with a positive outlook on life tend to live longer, more fulfilling lives than their mean and grumpy neighbors. Fear, anger, and other more difficult emotions and how we handle them are pretty closely related to this thing called stress. And stress is so powerful that it can straight up kill you in any number of ways, given the right opportunity. For better or worse we spend a lot of our lives swirling around like leaves on the winds of competing emotions. Before we can hope to harness these feelings, we first have to understand them.

[Intro] What do you think this person is feeling? How about him? And her? What about this one? It's not really hard to tell, is it? Most of us are better than we think at reading non-verbal cues and subtle expressions. The understanding among some, but not all, psychologists, like emotion expert Paul Ekman, is that facial expressions are culturally universal. So a Greek, Britain, American, Samoan, or Nigerian would all be able to discern the same basic emotions; happiness, sadness, disgust, anger, fear, and surprise, just by looking at your face. And our expressions don't just communicate emotions. According to the Facial Feedback Hypothesis, they can help regulate our emotions, too.

The act of smiling broadly, even if you aren't happy, can actually lift your mood just as scowling can lower it. This is how, bizarrely enough, a recent randomized controlled clinical trial suggested that a little Botox injection in the forehead might actually lessen depression. 'Cause it's apparently hard to feel down if your frowny muscles are frozen. Of course whether your face is paralyzed or not, some people are better at reading your emotions than others. For example, introverts are usually better at interpreting people's feelings, while extroverts are often better at expressing them. And you've probably heard embarrassing stories or even experienced first-hand how different cultures express emotions through particular gestures that are far from universal.

For example, in the United States, this is a peace sign, but you don't want to flip it around in the UK. And the iconic thumbs up gesture means "good job" in many cultures, but if you toss that thumb around in Greece, well let's just say you won't make any new friends. But of course emotions involve a lot more than making faces and hand gestures, they're also about our conscious experience of what we're feeling. So how do we actually feel all these feels, and how many different emotions are there? Back in the 1970s, American psychologist Carol Izard identified ten distinct basic human emotions present from infancy on. They are: joy, surprise, sadness, anger, disgust, contempt, shame, fear, guilt, and interest or excitement.

Others have since suggested that "pride" should be added to that list, and still others believe that love should be classified as a basic emotion as well, but Izard has argued that these and other emotions are just familiar combinations of the classic ten. Today, some psychologists describe our emotional experience as using a 2-dimensional model. The idea there is that any of the emotions you might feel while, like, reading Harry Potter or something are expressed on a spectrum, and as a combination of valence, roughly speaking "good" or "bad", and arousal--excited or not excited, basically. So if you're feeling both really excited and super positive when Harry finally bested Voldemort, you could say you were elated. On the other hand,

if you're at that part in Deathly Hallows when Harry, Ron and Hermoine are just sort of wandering around on the lam in a heavy mood, maybe your emotions fell more on the opposite side of the spectrum. In this instance, feeling depressed might be a combination of negative emotion and lack of excitement. So potentially every emotion can fall in degrees on this 2-dimensional scale. Like being terrified means you're more frightened than if you're just scared, just as being enraged is a more extreme form of anger than simply being mad. These polarities--positive versus negative, high arousal versus low arousal--affect our psychological states, and therefore our bodies as well. Because, you'll remember that what is psychological is ultimately

biological. And when it comes to the physical effects of our emotions, it pretty much goes the way you might expect. Happiness is helpful while chronic anger or depression makes us vulnerable to all kinds of problems with health and well-being. The good news is that if we're angry or sad, we often over-estimate the duration of our bad moods and under-estimate our capacity to adapt and bounce back from traumas, even if things feel hopeless, depressing, or stressful in the thick of it. And we've all experienced stress before, sometimes on a daily or even hourly basis. Much like anger or joy, stress can slowly build and simmer, or it can strike suddenly and with great intensity.

And yeah, stress, certainly the chronic or extreme type can be bad for your health, but defining stress is trickier than you might think. Psychologists would define stress as the process by which we perceive and respond to certain events, or stressors, that we view as challenging or threatening. In other words, stress isn't technically an emotion, it's more of a reaction to a disturbing or disruptive stimulus. And our reactions stem in part from our appraisal of that stimulus. A person can either roll with, or get worked up about a missed flight, an increased workload, or a strange thump in the house. These external stressors typically fall into three main categories: catastrophes, or unpredictable large scale events like war, natural

disasters and terrorist attacks; significant life changes, things like moving, having a child, losing or getting a job, or the death of a loved on; and then just everyday inconveniences like getting caught in traffic, running late, or feuding with your roommates. Any of these stressful events, big or small, even the good things, can fire up your sympathetic nervous system and trigger that old fight or flight response. In this way, it's important to understand that stress is ultimately natural. You experience it for a reason and a bit of short-lived stress can actually be a good thing. It can make you active and alert when you need to be, like an upcoming chemistry test might be stressing you out, but that might help you find focus so you can

dominate that thing. And in your body, moderate stress can kick the immune system into action to do things like heal wounds, and fight infections. It does this by triggering the release of stress hormones like adrenaline and cortisol. These chemical messengers are what get your organ systems to respond the way you need them to when you're getting charged by a bear, or focusing really hard on the gas law for your chemistry test. But to also why chronic stress can really wreck a body and mind, research has shown that abused children have a high risk of chronic disease and people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, which we'll talk about in an upcoming episode, experience higher rates of digestive, respiratory, circulatory, and infectious diseases. A lot of these

negative connections between your body's systems have to do with the fact that many of its most basic functions, like blood pressure, breathing, body temperature, digestion, and heartbeat, are in part regulated by the autonomic nervous system. We've talked before about how the sympathetic side of that system cranks you up, and the parasympathetic arm calms you down, but both those systems also interact with the so-called "brain-in-the-gut", the enteric nervous system, which helps regulate gastrointestional functioning. And it's this brain-gut connection that explains how stress causes digestive problems, because when that werewolf pops out of the bushes and a wave of cortisol washes through you, your body wants to focus its energy on sending blood to your

muscles so that you can react quickly. Which is good, right? But it may do that partly by shutting down digestion or decreasing the amount of digestive secretions and making your colon spasm; an anxious mind can lead to an anxious gut. Stress is an even bigger risk factor in North America's leading cause of death: heart disease, because it contributes to increased blood pressure, heart rate, and cholesterol levels in a number of different ways. Essentially, when your stressed out nervous system is redirecting all of its energy sources to your muscles and brain, it pulls flow away from your other organs. And one of those organs is the liver, whose job includes removing the fat and cholesterol from your blood. So basically, when a stressed liver

can't filter properly, that extra fat and cholesterol ends up circulating in your blood, which can settle around the heart. Don't believe me? One study monitored the blood cholesterol and clotting speed of 40 male tax accountants throughout the year, and it found that their cholesterol and clotting rates, and thus risk of heart attacks, increased dramatically during the weeks before tax day as they stressed out about finishing their work. And physiologically speaking, it's worth pointing out that some close relatives to stress, when it comes to their effects on the body, are pessimism and depression, which also have been linked to stress and heart disease. Many types of studies have found that people characterized by their optimism, happiness, love, and

positive feelings often live significantly longer than their grumpy, dour counterparts. Researchers don't quite know exactly how chronic negative emotional states influence health, but it may be some combination of lifestyle or behavioral factors, like neglecting your health, or not taking your heart meds when you're feeling blue, or social factors like the way the depression can be isolating and thus prevent others from helping you out. Or biological factors, like increases in certain kinds of inflammatory proteins released by the immune system in response to stress and sadness. So in the end, while stress may not directly cause disease, you could say that the two walk hand-in-hand.

In that way, it isn't a stretch to say that chronic stress can kill, so go ahead take a deep breath, feel your emotions, appreciate them, but don't let them run your life. Today, we talked more about how our emotions work and how we use facial expressions to help us communicate. We also looked at the 2-dimensional model of emotional experience and how anger, happiness, and depression can affect our health. We also discussed what stress does to your nervous system and how chronic stress can damage the functioning of your biological systems.

- [00:47] Lots of studies have shown that people with a positive
- [00:48] outlook on life tend to live longer, more fulfilling lives
- [00:52] than their mean and grumpy neighbors.
- [00:54] Fear, anger, and other more difficult emotions
- [00:56] and how we handle them are pretty closely
- [00:58] related to this thing called stress.
- [01:00] And stress is so powerful that it can straight up kill you
- [01:03] in any number of ways, given the right opportunity.
- [01:05] For better or worse we spend a lot of our lives
- [01:08] swirling around like leaves on the winds of
- [01:10] competing emotions. Before we can hope to harness
- [01:12] these feelings, we first have to understand them.
- [01:16] [Intro]
- [01:25] What do you think this person is feeling?
- [01:27] How about him?
- [01:28] And her?
- [01:29] What about this one?
- [01:30] It's not really hard to tell, is it?
- [01:31] Most of us are better than we think at
- [01:32] reading non-verbal cues and subtle expressions.
- [01:34] The understanding among some, but not all,
- [01:36] psychologists, like emotion expert Paul Ekman,
- [01:40] is that facial expressions are culturally universal.
- [01:42] So a Greek, Britain, American, Samoan, or Nigerian
- [01:46] would all be able to discern the same basic emotions;
- [01:48] happiness, sadness, disgust, anger, fear, and surprise,
- [01:52] just by looking at your face.
- [01:54] And our expressions don't just communicate emotions.
- [01:56] According to the Facial Feedback Hypothesis,
- [01:58] they can help regulate our emotions, too.
- [02:00] The act of smiling broadly, even if you aren't happy,
- [02:03] can actually lift your mood just as scowling can lower it.
- [02:06] This is how, bizarrely enough, a recent randomized
- [02:10] controlled clinical trial suggested that a little Botox
- [02:12] injection in the forehead might actually lessen
- [02:15] depression.
- [02:16] 'Cause it's apparently hard to feel down if your
- [02:18] frowny muscles are frozen.
- [02:19] Of course whether your face is paralyzed or not, some
- [02:21] people are better at reading your emotions than others.
- [02:24] For example, introverts are usually better at interpreting
- [02:26] people's feelings, while extroverts are often better at
- [02:28] expressing them.
- [02:30] And you've probably heard embarrassing stories or even
- [02:32] experienced first-hand how different cultures express
- [02:34] emotions through particular gestures that are far from universal.
- [02:38] For example, in the United States, this is a peace sign,
- [02:40] but you don't want to flip it around in the UK.
- [02:43] And the iconic thumbs up gesture means "good job" in
- [02:46] many cultures, but if you toss that thumb around in
- [02:48] Greece, well let's just say you won't make any new
- [02:50] friends.
- [02:50] But of course emotions involve a lot more than making faces
- [02:53] and hand gestures, they're also about our
- [02:55] conscious experience of what we're feeling.
- [02:58] So how do we actually feel all these feels, and how
- [03:01] many different emotions are there?
- [03:02] Back in the 1970s, American psychologist Carol Izard
- [03:05] identified ten distinct basic human emotions present
- [03:08] from infancy on.
- [03:09] They are: joy, surprise, sadness,  anger, disgust,
- [03:13] contempt, shame, fear, guilt, and interest or excitement.
- [03:17] Others have since suggested that "pride" should be
- [03:19] added to that list, and still others believe that love should
- [03:22] be classified as a basic emotion as well, but Izard has
- [03:24] argued that these and other emotions are just familiar
- [03:27] combinations of the classic ten.
- [03:29] Today, some psychologists describe our emotional
- [03:31] experience as using a 2-dimensional model.
- [03:33] The idea there is that any of the emotions you might feel
- [03:36] while, like, reading Harry Potter or something are
- [03:38] expressed on a spectrum, and as a combination of
- [03:40] valence, roughly speaking "good" or "bad", and
- [03:42] arousal--excited or not excited, basically.
- [03:46] So if you're feeling both really excited and super
- [03:48] positive when Harry finally bested Voldemort,
- [03:50] you could say you were elated. On the other hand,
- [03:52] if you're at that part in Deathly Hallows when Harry, Ron
- [03:54] and Hermoine are just sort of wandering around on the
- [03:57] lam in a heavy mood, maybe your emotions fell more on
- [04:00] the opposite side of the spectrum.
- [04:01] In this instance, feeling depressed might be a
- [04:03] combination of negative emotion and lack of excitement.
- [04:06] So potentially every emotion can fall in degrees on this
- [04:08] 2-dimensional scale. Like being terrified means you're
- [04:11] more frightened than if you're just scared, just as being
- [04:14] enraged is a more extreme form of anger than simply
- [04:16] being mad. These polarities--positive versus negative,
- [04:20] high arousal versus low arousal--affect our psychological
- [04:23] states, and therefore our bodies as well. Because, you'll
- [04:26] remember that what is psychological is ultimately
- [04:29] biological. And when it comes to the physical effects of
- [04:31] our emotions, it pretty much goes the way you might
- [04:33] expect. Happiness is helpful while chronic anger or
- [04:36] depression makes us vulnerable to all kinds of problems
- [04:38] with health and well-being. The good news is that if
- [04:41] we're angry or sad, we often over-estimate the duration
- [04:44] of our bad moods and under-estimate our capacity
- [04:46] to adapt and bounce back from traumas,
- [04:48] even if things feel hopeless, depressing, or stressful
- [04:52] in the thick of it.
- [04:52] And we've all experienced stress before, sometimes on
- [04:55] a daily or even hourly basis. Much like anger or joy,
- [04:59] stress can slowly build and simmer, or it can
- [05:02] strike suddenly and with great intensity.
- [05:04] And yeah, stress, certainly the chronic or extreme type
- [05:07] can be bad for your health, but defining stress
- [05:10] is trickier than you might think.
- [05:11] Psychologists would define stress as the process by
- [05:14] which we perceive and respond to certain events, or
- [05:16] stressors, that we view as challenging or threatening.
- [05:18] In other words, stress isn't technically an emotion, it's
- [05:20] more of a reaction to a disturbing or disruptive stimulus.
- [05:24] And our reactions stem in part from our appraisal of that
- [05:27] stimulus. A person can either roll with, or get worked up
- [05:30] about a missed flight, an increased workload, or a
- [05:32] strange thump in the house. These external stressors
- [05:35] typically fall into three main categories: catastrophes, or
- [05:38] unpredictable large scale events like war, natural
- [05:42] disasters and terrorist attacks; significant life changes,
- [05:44] things like moving, having a child,  losing or getting a
- [05:47] job, or the death of a loved on; and then just everyday
- [05:50] inconveniences like getting caught in traffic, running
- [05:52] late, or feuding with your roommates.
- [05:54] Any of these stressful events, big or small, even the
- [05:56] good things, can fire up your sympathetic nervous
- [05:58] system and trigger that old fight or flight response.
- [06:01] In this way, it's important to understand that stress
- [06:03] is ultimately natural. You experience it for a reason
- [06:06] and a bit of short-lived stress can actually be a good
- [06:08] thing. It can make you active and alert when you need to
- [06:11] be, like an upcoming chemistry test might be stressing
- [06:14] you out, but that might help you find focus so you can
- [06:16] dominate that thing. And in your body, moderate stress
- [06:18] can kick the immune system into action to do things
- [06:20] like heal wounds, and fight infections. It does this by
- [06:23] triggering the release of stress hormones like
- [06:26] adrenaline and cortisol. These chemical messengers
- [06:28] are what get your organ systems to respond the way
- [06:30] you need them to when you're getting charged by a
- [06:32] bear, or focusing really hard on the gas law
- [06:35] for your chemistry test. But to also why chronic stress
- [06:38] can really wreck a body and mind, research has shown
- [06:40] that abused children have a high risk of chronic disease
- [06:43] and people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder,
- [06:46] PTSD, which we'll talk about in an upcoming episode,
- [06:48] experience higher rates of digestive, respiratory,
- [06:51] circulatory, and infectious diseases. A lot of these
- [06:54] negative connections between your body's systems
- [06:56] have to do with the fact that many of its most basic
- [06:58] functions, like blood pressure, breathing, body
- [07:01] temperature, digestion, and heartbeat, are in part
- [07:04] regulated by the autonomic nervous system.
- [07:06] We've talked before about how the sympathetic side
- [07:08] of that system cranks you up, and the parasympathetic
- [07:11] arm calms you down, but both those systems also
- [07:13] interact with the so-called "brain-in-the-gut", the enteric
- [07:16] nervous system, which helps regulate gastrointestional
- [07:19] functioning. And it's this brain-gut connection that
- [07:21] explains how stress causes digestive problems,
- [07:24] because when that werewolf pops out of the bushes
- [07:26] and a wave of cortisol washes through you, your body
- [07:28] wants to focus its energy on sending blood to your
- [07:30] muscles so that you can react quickly.
- [07:33] Which is good, right?
- [07:34] But it may do that partly by shutting down digestion
- [07:36] or decreasing the amount of digestive secretions
- [07:38] and making your colon spasm; an anxious mind can
- [07:42] lead to an anxious gut. Stress is an even bigger risk
- [07:44] factor in North America's leading cause of death:
- [07:47] heart disease, because it contributes to increased blood
- [07:50] pressure, heart rate, and cholesterol levels in a number
- [07:52] of different ways. Essentially, when your stressed out
- [07:55] nervous system is redirecting all of its energy sources to
- [07:58] your muscles and brain, it pulls flow away from your
- [08:01] other organs. And one of those organs is the liver,
- [08:03] whose job includes removing the fat and cholesterol
- [08:06] from your blood. So basically, when a stressed liver
- [08:08] can't filter properly, that extra fat and cholesterol
- [08:11] ends up circulating in your blood, which can settle
- [08:14] around the heart.
- [08:14] Don't believe me?
- [08:15] One study monitored the blood cholesterol and clotting
- [08:18] speed of 40 male tax accountants throughout the year,
- [08:20] and it found that their cholesterol and clotting rates, and
- [08:23] thus risk of heart attacks, increased dramatically during
- [08:26] the weeks before tax day as they stressed out about
- [08:30] finishing their work.
- [08:30] And physiologically speaking, it's worth pointing out that
- [08:32] some close relatives to stress, when it comes to their
- [08:35] effects on the body, are pessimism and depression,
- [08:38] which also have been linked to stress and heart
- [08:41] disease. Many types of studies have found that people
- [08:43] characterized by their optimism, happiness, love, and
- [08:46] positive feelings often live significantly longer than their
- [08:49] grumpy, dour counterparts. Researchers
- [08:51] don't quite know exactly how chronic negative emotional
- [08:54] states influence health, but it may be some combination
- [08:57] of lifestyle or behavioral factors, like neglecting your
- [09:00] health, or not taking your heart meds when you're
- [09:02] feeling blue, or social factors like the way the depression
- [09:06] can be isolating and thus prevent others from helping
- [09:08] you out. Or biological factors, like increases in certain
- [09:11] kinds of inflammatory proteins released by the immune
- [09:13] system in response to stress and sadness.
- [09:16] So in the end, while stress may not directly cause
- [09:18] disease, you could say that the two walk hand-in-hand.
- [09:21] In that way, it isn't a stretch to say that chronic stress
- [09:24] can kill, so go ahead
- [09:25] take a deep breath,
- [09:26] feel your emotions,
- [09:28] appreciate them,
- [09:29] but don't let them run your life.
- [09:30] Today, we talked more about how our emotions work
- [09:32] and how we use facial expressions to help us
- [09:34] communicate. We also looked at the 2-dimensional
- [09:37] model of emotional experience and how anger,
- [09:39] happiness, and depression can affect our health.
- [09:42] We also discussed what stress does to your nervous
- [09:44] system and how chronic stress can damage the
- [09:46] functioning of your biological systems.

### Transcript (reading)

You've probably heard this story. Aron Ralston was out climbing in Utah's Bluejohn Canyon when a giant rock shifted under his feet, and he fell, pinning his right arm to the canyon wall. He was stuck, and worse, he hadn't told anyone where we was going. For the next five days, Ralston tried to move and chip away at the rock. He ate his remaining food, drank the last of his water. Eventually he drank his own urine, and started videotaping his goodbyes. But then something happened. Ralston had a dream. He saw himself as a father, picking up his son, and with that vision, an overpowering will to survive kicked in. He broke his arm bones, sawed through his flesh with a dull pocket knife, and freed himself.

Ralston harnessed some of our most powerful psychological forces -- hunger, thirst, desire to be part of a family, need to return to the human community -- they ignited his tenacity, which allowed him to do an incredible thing. He harnessed the power of motivation. Obviously, in a big, big way. [INTRO] In its most basic sense, motivation is the need or desire to do something. Whether that need is biological, social, or emotional, and whether that something is making dinner, going to college, or cutting off your arm, motivation is what gets you moving. But the big question is, why? Why do we do anything? I mean, why ever bother changing out of my sweatpants? Psychologists often view motivation in one of four ways. On their own, none of these

theories is perfect, but taken together, they help us understand what drives us. Let's start with the first theory: an evolutionary perspective. For a while in the early 20th century, it was popular to think of all behaviors as instincts, or innate drives to act a certain way. But this so-called Instinct Theory was misguided, in part because the presence of a tendency doesn't always mean it's supposed to be there. Like, we can imagine why a bunch of people might start rioting at a heated soccer match, but to say that they're supposed to -- a little short-sighted. Evolution is a far more complex, chaotic, and interesting process than that. Plenty of behaviors could just be accidents of evolution -- late paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould called

these accidents "spandrels," or traits that rather than being "adaptive" just stuck around as byproducts of other processes. Today we define instincts as complex, unlearned behaviors that have a fixed pattern throughout a species. For example, dogs instinctively shake their fur when wet, salmon return to the stream in which they hatched, and human babies know how to suckle just minutes after being born. These are true, genetically-predisposed instincts that do not require learning. But today we understand that while certain tendencies may be genetic, individual experience plays a major role in behavior and motivation, as well. So another theory of motivation suggests that a physiological need, or drive, simply compels

us to reduce that need. This is called the drive-reduction theory. This can be as simple as hearing my stomach growl, and looking for a burrito. My need is food, my drive is hunger, my drive-reduction behavior is burrito. Drive reduction is all about maintaining your body's homeostasis -- the physiological balance of its systems. As much as we're pushed to reduce our drives, we're also pulled along by incentives — the positive or negative stimuli that either entice or repel us. The mouth-watering smell of that burrito pulls me toward it, just as much as my hunger pushes me there. However, we're also clearly more complicated than our homeostatic systems, and drive-reduction theory may over-simplify a lot of our behavior. For example, a person may fast for days, ignoring

their body's hunger to honor some spiritual or political cause; and I know I'm not the only one who sometimes eats when I'm not actually hungry. So a third theory -- the theory of optimal arousal -- attempts to fill in some of those gaps. It suggests rather than just reducing a drive or tension, like hunger, we're motivated to maintain a balance between stimulation and relaxation. Say you're holed up in your house all weekend studying. You're bored and lonely and gettin' weird, so you call up some friends to go mountain biking or to a karaoke bar or whatever you like to do to for stimulation. The idea here is that you want to hit the right level of arousal -- which, take note, psychologists often use in a non-sexual sense -- without getting overstimulated and stressed.

So if you nearly break your face on that bike ride, or if the Journey covers at karaoke start getting too intense, you may need to back off and take a nap. Of course everyone has a different level of optimal arousal, and I'm guessing Aron Ralston's was fairly high. Adrenaline junkies may jump out of planes to hit their ideal level, whereas others might be satiated by an engaging book, or new knitting pattern. No matter which, the optimal arousal theory suggests that we're motivated to avoid both boredom and stress. And obviously not all needs are created equally. If I'm suffocating and can't catch a breath, I'm not going to be thinking about eating that burrito. And if I'm about to be ravaged by lions, I'm not going to worrying about my paycheck.

American psychologist Abraham Maslow illustrated this shuffling of priorities in the mid-1900's with his famous hierarchy of needs. Down at the bottom of the pyramid you'll find our most basic physiological needs for food, water, air, and moderate temperatures. The next rung up speaks to our need for safety, then comes love and belonging, followed by esteem or respect, and finally, once all those needs have been met, we have the relative luxury of being motivated by self-actualization and spiritual growth, and yoga retreats and stuff. Of course there are problems with Maslow's vision. Empirical research hasn't really supported his hierarchy. We tend to skip around on that pyramid all the time, and the importance of

those higher-level needs may vary depending on our culture and finances and personalities. But still, everyone is restricted by the lowest levels of the pyramid. So, regardless of the theories about why we have them, most schools of psychological thought agree that we are driven by at least three big motivators: sex, hunger, and the need to belong. We'll do a whole lesson later about all sorts of sex-related stuff, including how it motivates us. There's a lot there. For now, let's just say that sexual motivation is how we promote the survival of our species through recreation and/or procreation - both of which help human communities bond and expand. Without it, none of us would be here today, thinking about burritos and severed arms and sex and stuff.

Internally, we are biologically driven to knock boots by our sex hormones. We're also motivated by psychological and sociocultural influences - ranging from suggestive external stimuli plastered all over billboards, magazines, and TVs in the form of, you know, scantily-clad bodies sprawled out on beaches to more genteel desires like love, family, or adherence to personal, religious, or cultural values. Sex is a big motivator, but it isn't precisely a need, no matter what anyone has told you. People do not die without it. Hunger, though... After air and water, food is our body's greatest need, and thus obtaining food is one of our greatest motivations. Hunger may seem pretty simple. Eat food, stay alive. But physiologically and psychologically,

there is a lot going on. And like so many things, it starts in the brain. The sensation of hunger usually begins with a drop in your blood-sugar level. Glucose is our body's primary source of energy, and while you might not initially feel it drop, your brain will. Your hypothalamus monitors your blood chemistry, and responds to both high levels of the "hunger hormone" ghrelin, and low levels of glucose by triggering that feeling of hunger reminding you to eat something. I am in fact experiencing it right now! Once you've eaten that burrito, your metabolism takes over, converting that food into energy. But while our physiological need for calories varies depending on our body size and composition, your gender, and your age, our hunger is also shaped by our psychology, culture, and mood.

And these factors don't just rule when we're hungry, they also guide what we're hungry for. Biologically speaking, most humans, and many other animals, have a genetic taste for sweets and fatty foods, because they're typically high in energy. But other taste preferences are conditioned through experience and culture. I may have an aversion to oysters because they once made me sick, and love gingerbread cookies because my grandma used to make them. Although popular in Cambodia, I'm not too keen on eating fried tarantulas, just as lots of folks around the world think that the very idea of peanut butter is gross. Still, the feeling of hunger affects us the same. During World War Two in the US, some conscientious objectors volunteered for medical research

as an alternative way to serve their country. Perhaps the most famous of these studies was physiologist Ancel Keys' Minnesota Hunger Experiment, which measured the effects of semistarvation, by partially starving its volunteers. While ethically dubious, the experiment was geared toward understanding the many small and large effects of hunger, which was plaguing Europe at the time. The study started in 1944, by feeding 36 young, healthy men a normal diet for three months, then halving their caloric intake for six months, then slowly rehabilitating them to normal weight during the last three months. They ate mostly wartime-foods like root vegetables, bread, and pastas, and were required to walk 22 miles, and participate in various work and educational activities, for 40 hours each

week. The goal was to see a 25 percent drop in body weight during the starvation period. As you can imagine, the changes were dramatic. The men became gaunt and listless, and showed a decrease in strength, heart rate, and body temperature. But the psychological effects were perhaps even more dramatic. The men became totally obsessed with food. They dreamed about it, talked about it all the time, read cookbooks. They lost interest in sex and jokes and social activities. They were irritable, anxious, and depressed. In the end, they were all rehabilitated, but the study gave us some understanding of the devastating psychological effects of starvation. It also showed us something of the social effects, as the men withdrew from one another and isolated themselves. As one fundamental

need was frustrated, these men experienced the decline of another - the need to belong. Humans are social animals. Evolutionarily speaking, it's fair to say that social bonding has helped us survive. It's a tough world out there, and we've got a lot better shot at thriving if we're sharing resources and responsibilities, protecting and supporting each other in groups. That isn't say you need to be joined at the hip with everyone--our social needs have to be balanced with our autonomy, or sense of personal control, so we feel both connected and independent. But sometimes we're denied that sense of belonging. We've all experienced the pain of being ignored or rejected at some point in our lives. It's worse than just about anything.

The evidence for this is abundant - one recent study suggested that teenagers who had a sense of belonging to their community had better health and emotional outcomes than those who didn't feel like they belonged. Cultures all over the world actually use ostracism, or social exclusion, as a type of punishment. Whether it's kids in time-out, adults in exile, or prisoners in solitary confinement, separation feels like a punch in the gut. Never underestimate the power behind what motivates us. The need to survive, the need to belong... if you can harness that motivation, you can do just about anything. Just ask Aron Ralston. If you were motivated to learn today, hopefully you took in four theories of motivation including

the evolutionary perspective, drive-reduction, optimal arousal, and Maslow's hierarchy of needs, and how sex, hunger, and the need to belong motivate us.

- [01:23] But the big question is, why? Why do we do anything? I mean, why ever bother changing
- [01:29] out of my sweatpants?
- [01:30] Psychologists often view motivation in one of four ways. On their own, none of these
- [01:35] theories is perfect, but taken together, they help us understand what drives us. Let's start
- [01:40] with the first theory: an evolutionary perspective.
- [01:42] For a while in the early 20th century, it was popular to think of all behaviors as instincts,
- [01:47] or innate drives to act a certain way. But this so-called Instinct Theory was misguided,
- [01:52] in part because the presence of a tendency doesn't always mean it's supposed to be there.
- [01:56] Like, we can imagine why a bunch of people might start rioting at a heated soccer match,
- [02:00] but to say that they're supposed to -- a little short-sighted.
- [02:03] Evolution is a far more complex, chaotic, and interesting process than that. Plenty
- [02:07] of behaviors could just be accidents of evolution -- late paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould called
- [02:11] these accidents "spandrels," or traits that rather than being "adaptive" just stuck around
- [02:16] as byproducts of other processes.
- [02:18] Today we define instincts as complex, unlearned behaviors that have a fixed pattern throughout
- [02:23] a species. For example, dogs instinctively shake their fur when wet, salmon return to
- [02:28] the stream in which they hatched, and human babies know how to suckle just minutes after
- [02:33] being born.
- [02:34] These are true, genetically-predisposed instincts that do not require learning.
- [02:38] But today we understand that while certain tendencies may be genetic, individual experience
- [02:42] plays a major role in behavior and motivation, as well.
- [02:46] So another theory of motivation suggests that a physiological need, or drive, simply compels
- [02:51] us to reduce that need. This is called the drive-reduction theory. This can be as simple
- [02:55] as hearing my stomach growl, and looking for a burrito. My need is food, my drive is hunger,
- [03:01] my drive-reduction behavior is burrito.
- [03:03] Drive reduction is all about maintaining your body's homeostasis -- the physiological balance
- [03:07] of its systems.
- [03:08] As much as we're pushed to reduce our drives, we're also pulled along by incentives — the
- [03:12] positive or negative stimuli that either entice or repel us. The mouth-watering smell of that
- [03:18] burrito pulls me toward it, just as much as my hunger pushes me there.
- [03:21] However, we're also clearly more complicated than our homeostatic systems, and drive-reduction
- [03:26] theory may over-simplify a lot of our behavior. For example, a person may fast for days, ignoring
- [03:32] their body's hunger to honor some spiritual or political cause; and I know I'm not the
- [03:37] only one who sometimes eats when I'm not actually hungry.
- [03:39] So a third theory -- the theory of optimal arousal -- attempts to fill in some of those
- [03:44] gaps. It suggests rather than just reducing a drive or tension, like hunger, we're motivated
- [03:49] to maintain a balance between stimulation and relaxation.
- [03:53] Say you're holed up in your house all weekend studying. You're bored and lonely and gettin'
- [03:57] weird, so you call up some friends to go mountain biking or to a karaoke bar or whatever you
- [04:02] like to do to for stimulation.
- [04:03] The idea here is that you want to hit the right level of arousal -- which, take note,
- [04:08] psychologists often use in a non-sexual sense -- without getting overstimulated and stressed.
- [04:12] So if you nearly break your face on that bike ride, or if the Journey covers at karaoke
- [04:16] start getting too intense, you may need to back off and take a nap.
- [04:19] Of course everyone has a different level of optimal arousal, and I'm guessing Aron Ralston's
- [04:24] was fairly high. Adrenaline junkies may jump out of planes to hit their ideal level, whereas
- [04:29] others might be satiated by an engaging book, or new knitting pattern. No matter which,
- [04:34] the optimal arousal theory suggests that we're motivated to avoid both boredom and stress.
- [04:39] And obviously not all needs are created equally. If I'm suffocating and can't catch a breath,
- [04:44] I'm not going to be thinking about eating that burrito. And if I'm about to be ravaged
- [04:47] by lions, I'm not going to worrying about my paycheck.
- [04:50] American psychologist Abraham Maslow illustrated this shuffling of priorities in the mid-1900's
- [04:55] with his famous hierarchy of needs.
- [04:58] Down at the bottom of the pyramid you'll find our most basic physiological needs for food,
- [05:01] water, air, and moderate temperatures.
- [05:03] The next rung up speaks to our need for safety, then comes love and belonging, followed by
- [05:08] esteem or respect, and finally, once all those needs have been met, we have the relative
- [05:12] luxury of being motivated by self-actualization and spiritual growth, and yoga retreats and
- [05:18] stuff.
- [05:18] Of course there are problems with Maslow's vision. Empirical research hasn't really supported
- [05:21] his hierarchy. We tend to skip around on that pyramid all the time, and the importance of
- [05:25] those higher-level needs may vary depending on our culture and finances and personalities.
- [05:29] But still, everyone is restricted by the lowest levels of the pyramid. So, regardless of the
- [05:34] theories about why we have them, most schools of psychological thought agree that we are
- [05:38] driven by at least three big motivators: sex, hunger, and the need to belong.
- [05:43] We'll do a whole lesson later about all sorts of sex-related stuff, including how it motivates
- [05:47] us. There's a lot there. For now, let's just say that sexual motivation is how we promote
- [05:52] the survival of our species through recreation and/or procreation - both of which help human
- [05:57] communities bond and expand. Without it, none of us would be here today, thinking about
- [06:02] burritos and severed arms and sex and stuff.
- [06:04] Internally, we are biologically driven to knock boots by our sex hormones. We're also
- [06:09] motivated by psychological and sociocultural influences - ranging from suggestive external
- [06:14] stimuli plastered all over billboards, magazines, and TVs in the form of, you know, scantily-clad
- [06:19] bodies sprawled out on beaches to more genteel desires like love, family, or adherence to
- [06:24] personal, religious, or cultural values.
- [06:26] Sex is a big motivator, but it isn't precisely a need, no matter what anyone has told you.
- [06:31] People do not die without it.
- [06:33] Hunger, though...
- [06:33] After air and water, food is our body's greatest need, and thus obtaining food is one of our
- [06:39] greatest motivations.
- [06:40] Hunger may seem pretty simple. Eat food, stay alive. But physiologically and psychologically,
- [06:45] there is a lot going on. And like so many things, it starts in the brain.
- [06:50] The sensation of hunger usually begins with a drop in your blood-sugar level. Glucose
- [06:54] is our body's primary source of energy, and while you might not initially feel it drop,
- [06:59] your brain will.
- [07:00] Your hypothalamus monitors your blood chemistry, and responds to both high levels of the "hunger
- [07:05] hormone" ghrelin, and low levels of glucose by triggering that feeling of hunger reminding
- [07:10] you to eat something. I am in fact experiencing it right now!
- [07:13] Once you've eaten that burrito, your metabolism takes over, converting that food into energy.
- [07:17] But while our physiological need for calories varies depending on our body size and composition,
- [07:22] your gender, and your age, our hunger is also shaped by our psychology, culture, and mood.
- [07:28] And these factors don't just rule when we're hungry, they also guide what we're hungry
- [07:32] for.
- [07:33] Biologically speaking, most humans, and many other animals, have a genetic taste for sweets
- [07:37] and fatty foods, because they're typically high in energy. But other taste preferences
- [07:41] are conditioned through experience and culture.
- [07:43] I may have an aversion to oysters because they once made me sick, and love gingerbread
- [07:47] cookies because my grandma used to make them. Although popular in Cambodia, I'm not too
- [07:51] keen on eating fried tarantulas, just as lots of folks around the world think that the very
- [07:55] idea of peanut butter is gross.
- [07:57] Still, the feeling of hunger affects us the same.
- [08:00] During World War Two in the US, some conscientious objectors volunteered for medical research
- [08:04] as an alternative way to serve their country.
- [08:07] Perhaps the most famous of these studies was physiologist Ancel Keys' Minnesota Hunger
- [08:11] Experiment, which measured the effects of semistarvation, by partially starving its
- [08:16] volunteers.
- [08:17] While ethically dubious, the experiment was geared toward understanding the many small
- [08:21] and large effects of hunger, which was plaguing Europe at the time.
- [08:25] The study started in 1944, by feeding 36 young, healthy men a normal diet for three months,
- [08:31] then halving their caloric intake for six months, then slowly rehabilitating them to
- [08:36] normal weight during the last three months.
- [08:38] They ate mostly wartime-foods like root vegetables, bread, and pastas, and were required to walk
- [08:43] 22 miles, and participate in various work and educational activities, for 40 hours each
- [08:49] week. The goal was to see a 25 percent drop in body weight during the starvation period.
- [08:54] As you can imagine, the changes were dramatic. The men became gaunt and listless, and showed
- [08:59] a decrease in strength, heart rate, and body temperature.
- [09:02] But the psychological effects were perhaps even more dramatic. The men became totally
- [09:06] obsessed with food. They dreamed about it, talked about it all the time, read cookbooks.
- [09:10] They lost interest in sex and jokes and social activities. They were irritable, anxious,
- [09:15] and depressed.
- [09:16] In the end, they were all rehabilitated, but the study gave us some understanding of the
- [09:20] devastating psychological effects of starvation. It also showed us something of the social
- [09:24] effects, as the men withdrew from one another and isolated themselves. As one fundamental
- [09:29] need was frustrated, these men experienced the decline of another - the need to belong.
- [09:34] Humans are social animals. Evolutionarily speaking, it's fair to say that social bonding
- [09:38] has helped us survive. It's a tough world out there, and we've got a lot better shot
- [09:42] at thriving if we're sharing resources and responsibilities, protecting and supporting
- [09:46] each other in groups.
- [09:47] That isn't say you need to be joined at the hip with everyone--our social needs have to
- [09:51] be balanced with our autonomy, or sense of personal control, so we feel both connected
- [09:56] and independent.
- [09:57] But sometimes we're denied that sense of belonging. We've all experienced the pain of being ignored
- [10:01] or rejected at some point in our lives. It's worse than just about anything.
- [10:05] The evidence for this is abundant - one recent study suggested that teenagers who had a sense
- [10:09] of belonging to their community had better health and emotional outcomes than those who
- [10:13] didn't feel like they belonged.
- [10:14] Cultures all over the world actually use ostracism, or social exclusion, as a type of punishment.
- [10:19] Whether it's kids in time-out, adults in exile, or prisoners in solitary confinement, separation
- [10:24] feels like a punch in the gut.
- [10:25] Never underestimate the power behind what motivates us. The need to survive, the need
- [10:29] to belong... if you can harness that motivation, you can do just about anything. Just ask Aron
- [10:34] Ralston.
- [10:34] If you were motivated to learn today, hopefully you took in four theories of motivation including
- [10:39] the evolutionary perspective, drive-reduction, optimal arousal, and Maslow's hierarchy of
- [10:44] needs, and how sex, hunger, and the need to belong motivate us.

### Transcript (reading)

Mel Gibson did it, Tom Cruise nearly busted Oprah's couch doing it, and Kanye pretty much has owned it for years now. I'm talking about expressing too much emotion, usually in public and in weird and often insensitive ways. Such regrettable outbursts are not unique to celebrities, of course, and they can be enough to make us think of our emotions as irrational. But they're not... well, not usually. When they're not getting the better of us, they have work to do. Part of their job is to provide the energy and motivation that lets us meet our goals and our needs, and despite the occasional public fail, they often improve our performance in a given situation. So emotions play an important role in how we think and behave.

Of course, when they blow up and someone screams at a flight attendant or punches a paparazzo or jumps on stage and grabs the mic away from a teenager in the middle of her acceptance speech to say that someone else deserve the honor more - all hail Beyoncé - you're kind of off the rails of normal emotional function. Okay, definition time, general idea. Emotion is a mind and body's integrated response to a stimulus of some kind. Emotions involve physiological arousal, expressive behaviors and conscious experience. These can be short flashes or long, lingering responses, and they can be very clear or very confusing. Say, you're walking home at night and you hear footsteps behind you.

Physiological arousal occurs in the form of your heart pounding, your expressive behaviors could be like quickening your pace or moving toward a streetlight, and your conscious experience may include thinking "Oh I'm... I'm... gonna get mugged now? Is this like a werewolf behind me?" Feeling, you know, fear and panic. We know those three pieces are there, but psychologists are still puzzling out exactly how they fit together. How do thinking and feeling interact? Which one comes first? And do these bodily reactions - the pounding heart, the need to pee, the sweaty palms - come as a result of the thought "I"m scared", or did my tweaking out body trigger the thought in my brain?

These are just some of the questions that we'll be looking at in this messy, exhilarating, and terrifying world of emotions - no one gets out unscathed. [Intro] Our emotions represent and construct a big part of who we are. Think of how boring we would be - how boring the world would be without joy, embarrassment, heartache, or fear. What would motivate us to make decisions, be cautious, or bold, or strive to understand each other? What would keep our humanity intact? Where would punk rock come from? No doubt, we need our emotions, but how do they work? Well, like, apparently everything in psychology, there are a few different theories. In the late 1800s, pioneering American psychologist William James suggested that our feelings

follow our bodily reactions to external situations; that, for example, you feel sad because you are crying, or you're scared because you're shaking like a leaf. This idea was also proposed by Danish psychologist Carl Lange, and so, this concept that physiological arousal precedes emotion is called the James-Lange theory. But American physiologist Walter Cannon wasn't feeling it. He thought that too many of the body's reactions were too similar: a racing heart, fluttering stomach, and sweaty hands could be attributed to passion, fear, excitement, or anger. So how could they cause such different emotions? His colleague, Philip Bard, agreed, concluding that bodily responses and emotions occur separately, but simultaneously - and this idea is the base of the Cannon-Bard theory of emotion.

In other words, a racing heart doesn't cause fear, nor does the feeling of fear result in a racing heart, rather, both things just happen together. Today, most psychologists agree that our emotions are also tangled up with our cognition: whether or not we're afraid of a dog on the sidewalk depends a lot on whether we're interpreting the animal's behavior as threatening or friendly, probably also, what our personal history with dogs is. In the 1960s, American psychologist Stanley Schachter and Jerome Singer interpreted this idea that cognition can define emotion, into what they called their "two-factor theory". They believed that to experience emotion, you must both fear physiological arousal, and cognitively label that arousal.

And again, please remember that in psychology, arousal is different from how you're used to using it. Here, arousal can be thought of as activation or stress, or even energy - an increase in reactivity or wakefulness that primes us for some kind of action. So sometimes, arousal can spill over from one event to the next: say you just watched a heated soccer match, and you're all revved up, and someone looks at you funny. Suddenly, you might label that lingering arousal as anger, and the next thing you know, the whole stadium is one big rioting aggro chain reaction. Schachter and Singer examine this so-called "spillover effect" with an experiment that involved an usual combination of college guys and drugs.

First, they injected a bunch of college guys with the hormone epinephrine. This is basically adrenaline, and as you yourself have probably experienced, it induces a level of physiological activation that can go any number of ways emotionally. But then they threw a curve ball - some of the subjects were told to expect symptoms of feeling all revved up, while others were told the injection wouldn't produce any effects at all. Then, after being injected, each subject was left in a waiting room, and with them in the room was an actor, pretending to wait as well, and acting either all jerky and irritated, or super happy and euphoric. So the dude's just sitting there, jacked up on this hormone, and his heart is racing,

and his cheeks are all flushed, and in the case where the subject was told not to expect the effects, the study found that the guy would actually adopt the emotion of the actor in the room, becoming happy or testy, depending on how the person was acting. His body was having a physiological response to the hormone, but he ended up effectively deciding which emotion he was feeling. But, if the subject had been told that the injection would make him feel all pumped up, he'd actually report very little emotion, just because he was blaming that racing heart and flushed face on the drug, not a particular state of mind. So in terms of the two-factor theory, the cause of physiological arousal had to be identified before a person could feel and label the response as a particular emotion.

To Schachter, Singer, and their disciples, this meant that arousal spurs emotion, but cognition directs it. And yet, some researchers like Polish-born American psychologist Robert Zajonc, contend that all emotions are the result of just putting a name to our arousal - he suggests that many of our emotional reactions occur separately, or even before our cognition kicks in. If you hear a sudden crash outside your window, you'll automatically react with a jolt before your brain has the chance to think, "Gee, what was that crazy noise? Should I feel startled?" This is, in part, because when it comes to emotions, it's thought that our brains process sensory input by two different kinds of roots - top-down, or bottom-up approaches, and neuroscientists

can actually chart these two pathways in action. Some bigger, more complex feelings, like love and hatred take what we call the "high-road." Say, you read a love letter from your sweetie. You can pin that mushy feeling in your heart to the sensory stimulus of reading traveling from your eyes all the way through your thalamus to your brain's cortex. There, it can be analyzed by means of your cognitive process, perhaps, consciously, perhaps implicitly - and labelled with, like, "Aw, so sweet," at which point, it heads to your limbic system, the central brain region that drives emotion, motivation. At that point, you respond with all the warm-fuzzies. Other emotions, like simple likes, aversions, and fears, don't have to involve actual thinking, and take a sort of "low-road" neural path.

Like, that crash outside, or a baseball flying at your head. Such "jump-out-of-your-chair" stimuli bypass the cortex and zip right from the ear or the eye to the amygdala in the limbic system. It's a knee-jerk reaction that allows us to react quickly, often in the face of potential danger. In other words, that slower, high-road cortex route allows thinking about feeling, while the quick low-road shortcut allows instant emotional reaction. The stomach flip that happens when you see your ex, or the ten thousand pee breaks you gotta take before you give a speech, or your heart racing after a really good kiss - it's hard to argue with the fact that we often feel emotions with our bodies as much as with our brains.

And you can thank your autonomic nervous system the next time you're freaking out or trying to calm yourself down. Perhaps, you recall when we talked about the roles of the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of our autonomic nervous system. The sympathetic division is what arouses you in a crisis - it makes you hyper aware, makes your heart rate and breathing increase, spikes your blood sugar for extra energy - all that fun stuff. It's like a pit crew readying you for action, and once it's done its job and the danger has passed, the parasympathetic division steps in and talks you back down from the edge, slowing down your heart and breathing rates, and shutting off those stress hormones.

Generally, rubbing your back and being all, "Everything's gonna be okay, baby." What you need is the right degree of arousal for the situation: for example, if you're navigating through fast moving traffic in an unfamiliar city, you wanna hit the sweet spot of optimal arousal that allows you to focus your attention without either freaking out or getting all mellow and sleepy. Like we said before, there's a lot of overlap in the symptoms of different emotions. If you monitor the heart rate, breathing, and perspiration of a group of people who are watching three different movies, you probably couldn't tell who was watching the grisly horror movie, an angry fight, or a hot sex scene.

Fear, anger, and sexual arousal often deliver some of the same biological signals. But those emotions certainly feel different to the people experiencing them, just as they usually look different to others observing their expressions. And though differences in emotion can appear subtle, or even undetectable on brain scans, many of them do show distinctive patterns. For most people, positive feelings tend to show more activity in the left frontal lobe, while negative ones show up more in the right frontal lobe. And someone who's very afraid will show increased activity in the amygdala, our more primal emotional center. Emotions are fascinating things that drive us to do all sorts of brilliant and weird stuff.

Understanding them and being able to read them both in yourself and others is vital if you wanna make it through even an average day. But misreading your emotions or someone else's can be confusing - even dangerous - and it's just one of the things that we'll be looking at next week. Today, you learned about what emotions are, how they work, and why we need them. We talked about the James-Lange, Cannon-Bard, Schachter & Singer, and Zajonc theories, and we also looked at the relationship between cognition and emotion, and how the autonomic nervous system mobilizes emotion.

- [03:36] Today, most psychologists agree that our emotions are also tangled up with our cognition: whether
- [03:41] or not we're afraid of a dog on the sidewalk depends a lot on whether we're interpreting
- [03:45] the animal's behavior as threatening or friendly, probably also, what our personal history with
- [03:50] dogs is.
- [03:51] In the 1960s, American psychologist Stanley Schachter and Jerome Singer interpreted this
- [03:56] idea that cognition can define emotion, into what they called their "two-factor theory".
- [04:01] They believed that to experience emotion, you must both fear physiological arousal,
- [04:05] and cognitively label that arousal.
- [04:08] And again, please remember that in psychology, arousal is different from how you're used
- [04:12] to using it.
- [04:13] Here, arousal can be thought of as activation or stress, or even energy - an increase in
- [04:19] reactivity or wakefulness that primes us for some kind of action.
- [04:22] So sometimes, arousal can spill over from one event to the next: say you just watched
- [04:27] a heated soccer match, and you're all revved up, and someone looks at you funny.
- [04:30] Suddenly, you might label that lingering arousal as anger, and the next thing you know, the
- [04:35] whole stadium is one big rioting aggro chain reaction.
- [04:38] Schachter and Singer examine this so-called "spillover effect" with an experiment that
- [04:42] involved an usual combination of college guys and drugs.
- [04:46] First, they injected a bunch of college guys with the hormone epinephrine.
- [04:49] This is basically adrenaline, and as you yourself have probably experienced, it induces a level
- [04:54] of physiological activation that can go any number of ways emotionally.
- [04:58] But then they threw a curve ball - some of the subjects were told to expect symptoms
- [05:01] of feeling all revved up, while others were told the injection wouldn't produce any effects
- [05:06] at all.
- [05:07] Then, after being injected, each subject was left in a waiting room, and with them in the
- [05:11] room was an actor, pretending to wait as well, and acting either all jerky and irritated,
- [05:17] or super happy and euphoric.
- [05:18] So the dude's just sitting there, jacked up on this hormone, and his heart is racing,
- [05:23] and his cheeks are all flushed, and in the case where the subject was told not to expect
- [05:26] the effects, the study found that the guy would actually adopt the emotion of the actor
- [05:31] in the room, becoming happy or testy, depending on how the person was acting.
- [05:35] His body was having a physiological response to the hormone, but he ended up effectively
- [05:39] deciding which emotion he was feeling.
- [05:41] But, if the subject had been told that the injection would make him feel all pumped up,
- [05:45] he'd actually report very little emotion, just because he was blaming that racing heart
- [05:50] and flushed face on the drug, not a particular state of mind.
- [05:54] So in terms of the two-factor theory, the cause of physiological arousal had to be identified
- [05:59] before a person could feel and label the response as a particular emotion.
- [06:02] To Schachter, Singer, and their disciples, this meant that arousal spurs emotion, but
- [06:07] cognition directs it.
- [06:09] And yet, some researchers like Polish-born American psychologist Robert Zajonc, contend
- [06:13] that all emotions are the result of just putting a name to our arousal - he suggests that many
- [06:19] of our emotional reactions occur separately, or even before our cognition kicks in.
- [06:24] If you hear a sudden crash outside your window, you'll automatically react with a jolt before
- [06:28] your brain has the chance to think, "Gee, what was that crazy noise?
- [06:31] Should I feel startled?"
- [06:33] This is, in part, because when it comes to emotions, it's thought that our brains process
- [06:37] sensory input by two different kinds of roots - top-down, or bottom-up approaches, and neuroscientists
- [06:43] can actually chart these two pathways in action.
- [06:46] Some bigger, more complex feelings, like love and hatred take what we call the "high-road."
- [06:50] Say, you read a love letter from your sweetie.
- [06:53] You can pin that mushy feeling in your heart to the sensory stimulus of reading traveling
- [06:58] from your eyes all the way through your thalamus to your brain's cortex.
- [07:01] There, it can be analyzed by means of your cognitive process, perhaps, consciously, perhaps
- [07:05] implicitly - and labelled with, like, "Aw, so sweet," at which point, it heads to your
- [07:11] limbic system, the central brain region that drives emotion, motivation.
- [07:14] At that point, you respond with all the warm-fuzzies.
- [07:17] Other emotions, like simple likes, aversions, and fears, don't have to involve actual thinking,
- [07:23] and take a sort of "low-road" neural path.
- [07:25] Like, that crash outside, or a baseball flying at your head.
- [07:28] Such "jump-out-of-your-chair" stimuli bypass the cortex and zip right from the ear or the
- [07:32] eye to the amygdala in the limbic system.
- [07:35] It's a knee-jerk reaction that allows us to react quickly, often in the face of potential
- [07:40] danger.
- [07:41] In other words, that slower, high-road cortex route allows thinking about feeling, while
- [07:45] the quick low-road shortcut allows instant emotional reaction.
- [07:48] The stomach flip that happens when you see your ex, or the ten thousand pee breaks you
- [07:52] gotta take before you give a speech, or your heart racing after a really good kiss - it's
- [07:57] hard to argue with the fact that we often feel emotions with our bodies as much as with
- [08:01] our brains.
- [08:02] And you can thank your autonomic nervous system the next time you're freaking out or trying
- [08:05] to calm yourself down.
- [08:06] Perhaps, you recall when we talked about the roles of the sympathetic and parasympathetic
- [08:10] branches of our autonomic nervous system.
- [08:12] The sympathetic division is what arouses you in a crisis - it makes you hyper aware, makes
- [08:17] your heart rate and breathing increase, spikes your blood sugar for extra energy - all that
- [08:21] fun stuff.
- [08:22] It's like a pit crew readying you for action, and once it's done its job and the danger
- [08:26] has passed, the parasympathetic division steps in and talks you back down from the edge,
- [08:31] slowing down your heart and breathing rates, and shutting off those stress hormones.
- [08:36] Generally, rubbing your back and being all, "Everything's gonna be okay, baby."
- [08:39] What you need is the right degree of arousal for the situation: for example, if you're
- [08:43] navigating through fast moving traffic in an unfamiliar city, you wanna hit the sweet
- [08:47] spot of optimal arousal that allows you to focus your attention without either freaking
- [08:51] out or getting all mellow and sleepy.
- [08:53] Like we said before, there's a lot of overlap in the symptoms of different emotions.
- [08:57] If you monitor the heart rate, breathing, and perspiration of a group of people who
- [09:01] are watching three different movies, you probably couldn't tell who was watching the grisly
- [09:05] horror movie, an angry fight, or a hot sex scene.
- [09:08] Fear, anger, and sexual arousal often deliver some of the same biological signals.
- [09:13] But those emotions certainly feel different to the people experiencing them, just as they
- [09:18] usually look different to others observing their expressions.
- [09:22] And though differences in emotion can appear subtle, or even undetectable on brain scans,
- [09:26] many of them do show distinctive patterns.
- [09:29] For most people, positive feelings tend to show more activity in the left frontal lobe,
- [09:33] while negative ones show up more in the right frontal lobe.
- [09:36] And someone who's very afraid will show increased activity in the amygdala, our more primal
- [09:41] emotional center.
- [09:42] Emotions are fascinating things that drive us to do all sorts of brilliant and weird
- [09:47] stuff.
- [09:48] Understanding them and being able to read them both in yourself and others is vital
- [09:53] if you wanna make it through even an average day.
- [09:55] But misreading your emotions or someone else's can be confusing - even dangerous - and it's
- [10:01] just one of the things that we'll be looking at next week.
- [10:04] Today, you learned about what emotions are, how they work, and why we need them.
- [10:08] We talked about the James-Lange, Cannon-Bard, Schachter & Singer, and Zajonc theories, and
- [10:13] we also looked at the relationship between cognition and emotion, and how the autonomic

Question: Why do people do horrible things? Slave owners, and Nazis, any of the perpetrators of history's atrocities. How do they so successfully dehumanize other people for so long? At a smaller scale, how do bullies in the lunchroom manage to treat other kids with such cruelty and then go home and pet their dog and call their grandma and say "happy birthday?" Most of what we've been studying so far has focused on the individual. We've covered sub-fields of psychology like cognitive, personality, and clinical psychology, which tend to address the phenomena contained within a single person's mind. But there's also social psychology, which focuses on the power of the situation. It examines how we think about, influence,

and relate to one another in certain conditions. And it's better equipped to answer this question about people doing horrible things. Social psychology can not only give us some of the tools we need to understand why people behave brutally, it can also help us understand why we sometimes act heroically. Like why did Jean Valjean reveal his true identity to save some stranger from being tried in his place? And why did Nazi Oskar Schindler risk his own hide to save over a thousand Jewish people? What made Darth Vader throw the Emperor down that hole, even as he was being electrocuted? I can't say there are any easy answers about humanity's greatness or it's horribleness. Certainly, there aren't any that we can find in the next ten minutes. But we can point

ourselves in the right direction, and it starts with social thinking. When we're trying to understand why people act like villains or heroes, one of the things we're really asking is, "Did they do what they did because of their personality? Or their situation?" Austrian psychologist Fritz Heider began plumbing the depths of this question in the 1920s when he was developing what's now known as the Attribution Theory. This theory simply suggests that we can explain someone's behavior by crediting either their stable, enduring traits - also known as their disposition - or the situation at hand. And we tend to attribute people's behavior to either one or the other. Sounds pretty simple, but it can be surprisingly hard to tell whether someone's behavior is dispositional or situational.

Say you see Bruno at a party and he's acting like a wallflower all night. You might assume that he just has a shy personality. But maybe he doesn't; maybe he'd ordinarily be re-enacting all the moves from Footloose at this party but on this night, he had a twisted ankle or a headache or he'd just seen his ex with somebody new - those are all situational explanations. Overestimating the forces of personality while underestimating the power of the situation is called the Fundamental Attribution Error. And as you can imagine, making this kind of error can really end up warping your opinion of another person and lead to false snap judgments. This might not be such a big deal when it comes to Bruno and his awesome dance moves

but according to one study of college students, 7 in 10 women report that men have misread their polite friendliness - which would be appropriate for the situation - as a sexual come-on. We choose how we explain other people's behavior everyday and what we choose to believe can have big consequences. For example, our political views will likely be strongly influenced by whether we decide to attribute poverty or homelessness to personal dispositions, like being lazy and looking for a hand-out, or social circumstances like lack of education and opportunity. And these attitudes can, in turn, affect our actions. Activists and politicians know this well and they can use it to their advantage to persuade people in different ways.

In the late 1970s and 80s, psychologist Richard Petty and John Cacioppo developed a dual process theory of understanding how persuasion works. The first part of their model is known as the Central Route Persuasion and it involves calling on basic thinking and reasoning to convince people. This is what's at work when interested people focus on the evidence and arguments at hand, and are persuaded by the actual content of the message. So when you're watching a political debate, you might be persuaded by a candidate's particular policies, positions or voting history. That is, the stuff they're actually sayin'. But we all know that persuasion involves more than that. There is also Peripheral Route Persuasion at work. This influences people by the way of incidental cues, like a speaker's

physical attractiveness or personal relatability. There's not a lot of hard thinking going on here, it's more of a gut reaction. So you might decide to vote for a particular candidate because you think they're cute or they're from your home town. Peripheral Route Persuasion happens more readily when you're not paying a ton of attention, which is why billboards and television ads can be scarily effective. So that's how politicians and advertisers and maybe bosses and teachers and pushy friends try to change our behavior by changing our attitudes. But, it turns out that the reverse is true too. Our attitudes can be affected by our behaviors. You might have heard about the phrase, "Fake it till you make it." Meaning,

if you smile when you're actually sad the act of smiling may carry you through an attitude change until you actually feel better. Sometimes we can manipulate ourselves this way, but it's also an incredibly effective method people use to persuade each other. It generally works best in increments, through what psychologists call the foot-in-the-door phenomenon. People tend to more readily comply with a big request after they've first agreed to smaller more innocuous requests. Like Darth Vader didn't just go from "Go get 'em Anakin," to Dark Lord overnight. He was slowly enticed to the dark side, by a series of escalating actions and attitude changes. Do this favor for me, now run this errand, now kill these Padawans. Now blow up a planet!

What started this small actions went on to become big ones, suddenly transforming Vader's belief's about himself and others. There's plenty of experimental evidence that moral action really does strengthens moral convictions, just as amoral action strengthen amoral attitudes. And there is perhaps no better example of this than the Stanford Prison Experiment. Back in 1971 Stanford psych professor Philip Zimbardo and his team put an ad in the local paper looking for volunteers to participate in a 14 day experiment. After screening around 70 applicants, 24 male college students were deemed physically and mentally fit enough to participate in the study. For their troubles they'd each be given $15 a day.

The participants didn't know the exact nature of the experiment, just that it involved a fake prison situation. And with a coin flip, half were randomly deemed prisoners and the other half guards. The guards were told that it was the prisoner's behavior that was being studied. The prisoners weren't told much of anything, aside from that they had been arrested and taken to prison. Other than that neither group had many specific instructions. Zimbardo wanted to observe how each party adapted to their roles, and so, on a quiet Sunday summer morning in Palo Alto, real cops swooped in and arrested the prisoners in their homes under charges of robbery. They were frisked, handcuffed, and read their rights.

Back at the station, they were formally booked and then blindfolded in a holding cell wearing only hospital gowns. The researchers had taken great care to make sure that the setting was extremely realistic, which is one reason they used real cops in the arrest before handing the prisoners over to the fake guards. And it took no time at all for this role-playing to become really, really real. The initial trauma of the humiliation of the arrest, the booking, strip-searching and waiting, immediately kicked off a loss of identity in the prisoners. A few prisoners only made it through the first night before they became too emotionally distressed and had to be released. Things only went downhill from there. Though the guards could act any way they wanted as

long as they didn't physically hurt anyone, encounters quickly became cruel, hostile, and dehumanizing. Guards hurled insults and commands, referred to the prisoners only by number, and put some of them in solitary confinement. Prisoners started breaking down, others rebelled, and still others became passively resigned as if they deserved to be treated so badly. Things got bad enough that the experiment ended after only six days, causing relief in the fake prisoners, while interestingly leaving some fake guards feeling angry. Luckily, everyone involved bounced back to normal once out of the prison setting. All of those negative moods and abusive behaviors were situational, and that fact reinforced the important concept that the power of a given situation can easily override individual

differences in personality. Although it would never fly by today's ethical standards, Zimbardo's famous study remains influential today because it sheds such a harsh light on the nature of power and corruption. And yet, people differ. Many people succumb and become compliant in terrible situations, but not everyone does. Lots of people risked their lives to hide Jewish people in World War II, help runaway slaves along the Underground Railroad, keep Tutsi refugees safe during the Rwandan genocide, or generally refuse to comply or participate in actions they didn't believe in. Some people can, and do resist turning to the dark side, even when it seems like everyone around them is going mad. And yet, the fact is, these people tend to be in the minority.

So why? Why does it seem so easy to rationalize a negative action or attitude and so hard to muster the positive ones? One partial explanation comes from American social psychologist Leon Festinger's theory of cognitive dissonance. It's one of the most important concepts in psychology. Festinger's theory begins with the notion that we experience discomfort - or dissonance - when our thoughts, beliefs, or behaviors are inconsistent with each other. Basically, we don't like to confuse ourselves. For example, if Bruno was generally considered a peaceful person but finds himself suddenly punching at his friend over a fender-bender, he's likely experiencing some level of cognitive dissonance.

So, by Festinger's thinking, Bruno might relieve this tension by actually modifying his beliefs in order to match the action's he's already committed, like telling himself, "Turns out, I'm not such a nice guy after all, maybe I'm actually a bully." On the other hand, he might resolve his internal tension by changing how he thinks about the situation. He might still think of himself as a peaceful person, but realize that an unusual situation led to an unusual action, like, he'd had a bad day and it was his mom's new car, or his friend was just really askin' for it. So, he can keep being the ordinarily peaceful guy he was before. It's kind of an inverted fundamental attribution error if you think about it. Attributing a

person's actions mainly to the situation, instead of his personality. The point is that this mismatch between what we do and who we think we are induces tension - cognitive dissonance - and that we tend to want to resolve that tension. That's part of what turns an Anakin into a Darth Vader, and then, if we're lucky, back into an Anakin. Today you learned that social psychology studies how people relate to each other. We discussed Fritz Heider's attribution theory, and fundamental attribution error. You also learned how attitudes can affect actions, like through the duel-process theory of persuasion, and also how behavior can change attitudes, like through the foot-in-the-door phenomenon. The Stanford prison experiment

illustrated how a situation can override individual differences in personality, while Leon Festinger's theory of cognitive dissonance explained how we ease the tension between conflicting thoughts and actions.

- [05:45] The participants didn't know the exact nature of the experiment, just that it involved a
- [05:49] fake prison situation. And with a coin flip, half were randomly deemed prisoners and the
- [05:54] other half guards. The guards were told that it was the prisoner's behavior that was being
- [05:58] studied. The prisoners weren't told much of anything, aside from that they had been arrested
- [06:02] and taken to prison. Other than that neither group had many specific instructions.
- [06:07] Zimbardo wanted to observe how each party adapted to their roles, and so, on a quiet
- [06:12] Sunday summer morning in Palo Alto, real cops swooped in and arrested the prisoners in their
- [06:18] homes under charges of robbery. They were frisked, handcuffed, and read their rights.
- [06:23] Back at the station, they were formally booked and then blindfolded in a holding cell wearing
- [06:27] only hospital gowns. The researchers had taken great care to make sure that the setting was
- [06:31] extremely realistic, which is one reason they used real cops in the arrest before handing
- [06:36] the prisoners over to the fake guards. And it took no time at all for this role-playing
- [06:41] to become really, really real.
- [06:43] The initial trauma of the humiliation of the arrest, the booking, strip-searching and waiting,
- [06:48] immediately kicked off a loss of identity in the prisoners. A few prisoners only made
- [06:52] it through the first night before they became too emotionally distressed and had to be released.
- [06:57] Things only went downhill from there. Though the guards could act any way they wanted as
- [07:01] long as they didn't physically hurt anyone, encounters quickly became cruel, hostile,
- [07:05] and dehumanizing. Guards hurled insults and commands, referred to the prisoners only by
- [07:09] number, and put some of them in solitary confinement. Prisoners started breaking down, others rebelled,
- [07:14] and still others became passively resigned as if they deserved to be treated so badly.
- [07:19] Things got bad enough that the experiment ended after only six days, causing relief
- [07:23] in the fake prisoners, while interestingly leaving some fake guards feeling angry.
- [07:28] Luckily, everyone involved bounced back to normal once out of the prison setting. All
- [07:32] of those negative moods and abusive behaviors were situational, and that fact reinforced
- [07:37] the important concept that the power of a given situation can easily override individual
- [07:42] differences in personality. Although it would never fly by today's ethical standards, Zimbardo's
- [07:46] famous study remains influential today because it sheds such a harsh light on the nature
- [07:50] of power and corruption.
- [07:52] And yet, people differ. Many people succumb and become compliant in terrible situations,
- [07:56] but not everyone does. Lots of people risked their lives to hide Jewish people in World
- [08:00] War II, help runaway slaves along the Underground Railroad, keep Tutsi refugees safe during
- [08:04] the Rwandan genocide, or generally refuse to comply or participate in actions they didn't
- [08:09] believe in. Some people can, and do resist turning to the dark side, even when it seems
- [08:13] like everyone around them is going mad. And yet,  the fact is, these people tend to be in the minority.
- [08:19] So why? Why does it seem so easy to rationalize a negative action or attitude and so hard
- [08:24] to muster the positive ones? One partial explanation comes from American social psychologist Leon
- [08:29] Festinger's theory of cognitive dissonance. It's one of the most important concepts in psychology.
- [08:34] Festinger's theory begins with the notion that we experience discomfort - or dissonance
- [08:38] - when our thoughts, beliefs, or behaviors are inconsistent with each other.
- [08:42] Basically, we don't like to confuse ourselves.
- [08:44] For example, if Bruno was generally considered a peaceful person but finds himself suddenly
- [08:48] punching at his friend over a fender-bender, he's likely experiencing some level of cognitive dissonance.
- [08:53] So, by Festinger's thinking, Bruno might relieve this tension by actually modifying his beliefs
- [08:58] in order to match the action's he's already committed, like telling himself, "Turns out,
- [09:02] I'm not such a nice guy after all, maybe I'm actually a bully." On the other hand, he might
- [09:06] resolve his internal tension by changing how he thinks about the situation. He might still
- [09:10] think of himself as a peaceful person, but realize that an unusual situation led to an
- [09:15] unusual action, like, he'd had a bad day and it was his mom's new car, or his friend was
- [09:20] just really askin' for it. So, he can keep being the ordinarily peaceful guy he was before.
- [09:25] It's kind of an inverted fundamental attribution error if you think about it. Attributing a
- [09:29] person's actions mainly to the situation, instead of his personality. The point is that
- [09:33] this mismatch between what we do and who we think we are induces tension - cognitive dissonance
- [09:38] - and that we tend to want to resolve that tension. That's part of what turns an Anakin
- [09:42] into a Darth Vader, and then, if we're lucky, back into an Anakin.
- [09:46] Today you learned that social psychology studies how people relate to each other. We discussed
- [09:50] Fritz Heider's attribution theory, and fundamental attribution error. You also learned how attitudes
- [09:56] can affect actions, like through the duel-process theory of persuasion, and also how behavior
- [10:01] can change attitudes, like through the foot-in-the-door phenomenon. The Stanford prison experiment
- [10:06] illustrated how a situation can override individual differences in personality, while Leon Festinger's
- [10:11] theory of cognitive dissonance explained how we ease the tension between conflicting thoughts and actions.

### Transcript (reading)

If someone in a position of authority told you to like, stop walking on the grass, you would stop walking on the grass, right? And if they told you to help someone's grandma cross the street, or pick up your dog's poop, or put your shoes on before you go into a store, you'd probably comply. But what if they ordered you to physically hurt another person? You're probably thinking "No way! I could never do something like that." But there's a good chance you're wrong. In the early 1960s, Yale University psychologist Stanley Milgram began what would become one of social psychology's most famed and chilling experiments. Milgram began his work during the widely publicized trial of World War II Nazi war criminal Adolf

Eichmann. Eichmann's defense, along with other Nazis', for sending millions of people to their deaths, was that he was simply following the orders of his superiors. And while that may have been true, it didn't fly in court and Eichmann was ultimately executed for his crimes. But the question got Milgram to thinking, what might the average person be capable of when under orders? So, for his initial experiment, Milgram recruited forty male volunteers using newspaper ads. He built a phony "shock generator" with a scale of thirty switches that could supposedly deliver shocks in increments from 30 volts up to 450 volts, labeled with terms like "slight shock" to "dangerous shock" up to simply "XXX." He then paired each volunteer participant

with someone who was also apparently a participant, but was in fact one of Milgram's colleagues, posing as a research subject. He had them draw straws to see who would be the "learner" and who would be the "teacher." The volunteers didn't realize that the draw was fixed so that they'd always be the teacher, while Milgram's buddy would be the learner. So the fake learner was put into a room, strapped to a chair, and wired up with electrodes. The teacher, the person who was being studied, and a researcher who was played by an actor, went into another room with a shock generator that the teacher had no idea was fake. The learner was asked to memorize a list of word pairs, and the participant was told that he'd

be testing the learner's recall of those words and should administer an electric shock for every wrong answer, increasing the shock level a little bit each time. From here, the pretend learner purposely gave mainly wrong answers, eliciting shocks from the participant. If a participant hesitated, perhaps swayed by the learner's yelps of pain, the researcher gave orders to make sure he continued. These orders were delivered in a series of four prods. The first was just "Please continue," and if the participant didn't comply, the researcher issued other prods until he did. He'd say "The experiment requires you to continue" and then "It's absolutely essential that you continue" and finally "You have no choice but to continue."

Even Milgram was surprised by the first round of experiments. About two-thirds of the participants ended up delivering the maximum 450 volt shock. All of the volunteers continued to at least 300 volts. Over years, Milgram kept conducting this experiment, changing the situation in different ways to see if it had any effect on people's obedience. What he repeatedly found was that obedience was highest when the person giving the orders was nearby and was perceived as an authority figure, especially if they were from a prestigious institution. This was also true if the victim was depersonalized, or placed at a distance such as in another room. Plus, subjects were more likely to comply with the orders if they didn't see anyone else disobeying, if there were no role models of defiance.

In the end, Milgram's path-breaking work sheds some seriously harsh light on the enormous power of two of the key cornerstone topics of social psychology: social influence and We all conform to some sort of social norms, like following traffic laws or even obeying the dress codes for different roles and environments. When we know how to act in a certain group or setting, life just seems to go more smoothly. Some of this conformity is non-conscious automatic mimicry, like how you're likely to laugh if you see someone else laughing or nod your head when they're nodding. In this way, group behavior can be contagious. But overall, conformity describes how we adjust our behavior or thinking to follow the behavior

or rules of the group we belong to. Social psychologists have always been curious about the degree to which a person might follow or rebel against their group's social norms. During the early 1950s, Polish-American psychologist Solomon Ash expressed the power of conformity through a simple test. In this experiment, the volunteer is told that they're participating in a study on visual perception and is seated at a table with five other people. The experimenter shows the group a picture of a standard line and three comparison lines of various lengths, and then asked the people to say which of the three lines matches the comparison line. It's clear to anyone with any kind of good vision that the second line is the right answer, but the thing is,

most, if not all of the other people in the group start choosing the wrong line. The participant doesn't know that those other people are all actors, a common deception used in social-psychological research, and they're intentionally giving the wrong answer. This causes the real participant to struggle with trusting their own eyes or going with the group. In the end most subjects still gave what they knew was the correct answer, but more than a third were essentially just willing to give the wrong answer to mesh with the group. Ash, and subsequent researchers, found that people are more likely to conform to a group if they're made to feel incompetent or insecure and are in a group of three or more people, especially

if all those people agree. It also certainly doesn't hurt if the person admires the group because of maybe their status or their attractiveness, and if they feel that others are watching their behavior. We also tend to conform more if we're from a culture that puts particular emphasis on respect for social standards. This might sound a little bit familiar, like, all of high school, fraternities or sororities, the big company you work for, or any other group that you've ever been a part of. The classic experiments of Milgram and Ash showed us that people conform for lots of different reasons, but they both underscored the power of situation in conformity - whether that situation elicits respect for authority, fear of being different, fear of rejection,

or simply a desire for approval. This is known as normative social influence, the idea that we comply in order to fuel our need to be liked or belong. But, of course, groups influence our behavior in more ways than just conformity and obedience. For example, we may perform better or worse in front of a group. This is called social facilitation and it's what might, say, help you sprint the last hundred meters of a race if people are cheering you on, but it's also what can make you nervous enough to forget the words to that poetry you were supposed to be slamming in front of a crowd. But that's what can happen in front of a group, what happens when you're actually part of a group? Do you work harder or start slacking? One study found that if you blindfold students,

hand them a rope and tell them to pull as hard as they can in a game of tug-of-war, the subjects will put in less work if they think they're part of the team instead of pulling by themselves. About 20% less, it turns out. This tendency to exert less effort when you're not individually accountable is called social loafing. That's pretty good. You can now add the word "loafing" to your scientific vocabulary. But a group's ability to either arouse or lessen our feelings of personal responsibility can make us do more dangerous things than just phone in some group homework assignment. It can also lead to deindividuation, the loss of self-awareness and restraint that can occur in group situations. Being part of a crowd can create a powerful combination of arousal

and anonymity; it's part of what fuels riots and lynch mobs and online trolling. The less individual we feel, the more we're at the mercy of the experience of our group, whether it's good or bad. And it should come as no surprise that the attitudes and beliefs we bring to a group grow stronger when we talk with others who share them. This is a process psychologists know as group polarization, and it often translates into a nasty "us" vs "them" dynamic. And you know what is great at polarizing groups? The internet. The internet has made it easier than ever to connect like-minded people and magnify their inclinations. This can of course breed haters, like racists may become more racist in the absence of conflicting viewpoints,

but it can, and often does, work for good, promoting education, crowd-sourcing things like fundraising, and organizing people to fight all kinds of worldsuck. And group dynamics can not only affect our personal decisions, they can also influence really big decisions on a larger, even national scale. Groupthink is a term coined by social psychologist Irving Janis, to describe what happens when a group makes bad decisions because they're too caught up in the unique internal logic of their group. When a group gets wrapped up in itself and everyone agrees with each other, no one stops to think about other perspectives. As a result, you get some big and bad ideas, including some enormous historical fiascoes,

like the Watergate cover-up and the Bay of Pigs invasion and the Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident. So while two heads may often be better than one, it's important to make sure those heads are still open to different opinions or they could do some really dumb stuff. In the end, it's best to understand ourselves and our decisions as informed simultaneously by both individual and group factors, personality, and situation. And don't get too freaked out about what people are capable of; I mean, just think back to Milgram's experiment. For the two-thirds of us who would shock someone to death in the right circumstance, there's another third who wouldn't, reminding us that while group behavior is powerful, so is individual choice.

Today you learned about the power of social influence, conformity, and authority. We looked at the shocking results of the famous Milgram experiment, the concept of automatic mimicry, and how Solomon Ash proved the power of conformity in situation. You also learned how normative social influence sways us, how social facilitation can make or break your performance and how social loafing makes people lazy in a group. And finally, we discussed how harmful deindividuation, group polarization, and groupthink can be.

### Transcript (reading)

Let me tell you about Robber's Cave. In 1954, a group of 11 boys, all about 12 years old, were invited to a special summer camp in the deep woods of southeastern Oklahoma, at a place called Robber's Cave State Park. None of the boys knew each other, although they all came from similar backgrounds. They spent their days bonding over things like games and swimming and treasure hunts, and in no time, they formed a tight friendly group. They even came up with a name for themselves: the Rattlers. But soon they began to notice something. No, not a guy in the woods with a hockey mask, there was another group of boys also 11 of them, also the same age, that had been staying at the other end of the park the whole time. The Rattlers never interacted with these other

boys, so they didn't know that those kids were also spending time bonding over games and swimming and treasure hunts, and that they'd come up with a name for themselves, too: the Eagles. But the Rattlers didn't like the look of the Eagles, oh, no, they didn't like them using their baseball diamond or their dining hall. And the feeling was mutual. It didn't take long for each group to start complaining to the camp's counselors about the other gang, and eventually, they both said that they wanted to set up a contest to determine once and for all which group was better. The counselors were only too happy to comply, because as I'm sure you've figured out by now, those counselors were actually researchers.

The man who set up what would be remembered as the Robber's Cave Experiment was Turkish American social psychologist Muzafer Sherif. He was interested in what it would take for rivals to overcome their differences and resolve their conflicts. Specifically, Sherif wanted to test something called Realistic Conflict Theory. He hypothesized that conflict happens when you combine negative prejudices with competition over resources, and the boys at Robber's Cave were well on their way to proving him right. Over the next couple of days, the Rattlers and the Eagles competed against each other for prizes in a series of games, like tug-of-war and foot races, and soon, what started as your basic trash talking and taunting and name-calling morphed into fist-fights, thefts,

and raids on each others' cabins. But then their dynamics changed or were changed for them. After the games were over, the researchers integrated the groups and gave the kids shared goals that they could only achieve through cooperation. The tide quickly turned. All 22 boys worked together to move a stalled truck that was carrying their food, they took care of a partially felled tree that was deemed a danger to the camp, they collaborated in setting up tents, even though they weren't given complete sets of equipment. While isolation and competition made enemies of the strangers, shared goals and cooperation turned enemies into friends. Over the past 39 weeks, we've learned a lot about ourselves, our emotions and our personalities,

how our minds can get sick, how we can help them get well again, why we can do vicious things and then turn around and act like heroes. So maybe it's fitting that we wrap up this course by looking at a couple of opposing forces that some consider the very definition of human nature: aggression and altruism. Conflict and cooperation. You might think of it as the psychology of war and peace, or simply, what we can all learn from a bunch of 12 year olds. In psychology, aggression is defined as "behavior intended to hurt or destroy someone, something, or even yourself." People aggress, as psychologists say, in all kinds of ways, verbally, emotionally, and physically, and for lots of different reasons: out of anger, to assert dominance,

or as a response to fear. But that's just a glimpse into why someone might become aggressive. Where does the aggression actually come from? Like a lot of behaviors we've talked about it, it seems to emerge from that familiar combination of biological factors, like genetic, neurological, and biochemical influences, and our environment and experience. In terms of genetic influences, studies of twins, and yes, Crash Course Psychology might have been called Crash Course Studies of Twins, showed that if one identical twin has a violent temper, often the other one does, too, but fraternal twins are much less likely to be so similar. Neurologically speaking, no single area of the brain controls aggression, but certain

areas like the limbic system do appear to facilitate it. Research on violence and criminality has also revealed a link between aggression and diminished activity in the frontal lobes, which play a vital role in impulse control. And finally, our aggressiveness can be influenced by our own biochemistry, hormones like testosterone and glucocorticoids and pheromones have all been implicated in animal models of aggression. It's a little trickier in humans, it's a lot trickier in humans, but it's highly likely that our hormones are intimately linked with feeling and showing aggression. Obviously, aggression isn't just about biology. Psychological and cultural factors also play an important role, as does the power of the situation. For example, there's the Frustration-Aggression

Hypothesis, the simple idea that people become aggressive when they're blocked from reaching a goal. To demonstrate, consider the not-very aggressive sport of baseball. There's a study that analyzed 44 years worth of baseball stats, and focused on the more than 27,000 incidents when a pitcher hit a batter with a ball. It turned out that this was most likely to occur if the pitcher was frustrated by a recent home run or if one of his own teammates had been hit by a pitch in the previous inning. But we also learn aggression by watching others. Like, if you grew up watching your parents throw popcorn and jeering lewdly at their most hated soccer team, you might have learned something from their behavior. So combine all of those biological factors and funnel

them through a particular person with a particular history in a particular situation, and you can begin to see how aggression can have many roots that grow together. Thankfully, though, humans are more than their bad tempers. While some things in people will leave us annoyed and angry, others breed friendship and affection. So yes, there are positive topics in social psychology, like altruism, our selfless, even self-sacrificing regard for the welfare of others. This could be something as simple as jumpstarting a stranger's car or as heroic as running into a burning building to save someone. But if being altruistic is so awesome, why aren't we all that way all the time? Or maybe the better question is, why do we ever do anything selfless, like, what's in it for us?

In the late 1960s, social psychologists Bibb Latane and John Darley conducted a series of experiments examining when and why we help others. In one experiment, they placed a subject in a room, sometimes alone, sometimes with two other subjects, and sometimes with two actors posing as subjects. Then, they simulated an emergency by filling the room with smoke and waited to see if the subject would do anything to alert the others or help themselves. If the subject was alone, they'd report the smoke 75% of the time. But subjects in a group of three only spoke up 38% of the time. And when they were stuck in the room with two oblivious actors, only 10% of the participants said anything to the others. Darley and Latane

found that people typically helped others only if they noticed the incident, interpreted it as an emergency, and then finally, assumed responsibility, and all of these things were much more likely to occur if a person was alone, while the presence of others deterred the person from helping. This kind of diffusion of responsibility referred to as the bystander effect, can weaken our instinct for altruism. The bystander effect is a bit like the concept of social loafing that we talked about. If you're around other people, it's easier to think that someone else is going to pick up the slack or in this case, come to the rescue. When people do decide to help others, they may do it for a number of reasons. One perspective

is that we tend to help others mainly out of self-interest. By this thinking, helping really isn't altruistic at all, and instead, our actions boil down to a sort of cost-benefit analysis. Like, maybe we'd turn in a lost wallet because we're hoping for a reward or we pitch in on a project at work because we think we'll get recognized and promoted by our bosses. Social psychologists contextualize these kinds of examples in the broader theory of social exchange. When it comes to doing things for other people, we're always trying to maximize our personal rewards while minimizing our costs. But social exchange doesn't have to be as selfish as that, it can also mean that we act altruistically because we expect

that the people we help will go on to help others, so if we give someone a hand changing a tire, maybe they'll stop next time they see someone else, maybe even us, broken down on the side of the road. You might know this concept, sometimes it's called the norm of reciprocity, sometimes it's called paying it forward. And then there's the social responsibility norm, which is the simple expectation that people will help those who depend on them, like any parent can expect to give more help than they're going to receive from young children. That's just part of being a parent. Naturally, the world would be a delightful place if altruism were the standard for human behavior, but then, psychology wouldn't be nearly so interesting.

In some ways, you might say that what fuels conflict is the opposite of altruism: self-interest. Social psychologists view conflict as any perceived incompatibility of actions, goals, or ideas. That could mean two nations fighting over a border, sparring religious or political groups, or you and your boo fighting over whose turn it is to do the dishes. And in a weird conundrum of human behavior a lot of conflicts arise from what psychologists call "a social trap," where people act in their own short term self-interest, even though it takes a toll on the larger group and on themselves over the long-term. You see this kind of thing all the time on an individual scale, like in a crime movie, when a criminal

just betrays all of his criminal friends to get the big payout, it doesn't turn out very well for him in the end. But on a larger scale, you can find social traps taking their toll on the environment, like when we poach elephants to sell their ivory or cut down old growth forests to make a quick buck in the lumber market. Either way, when self-interest succeeds in wrecking the collective interest by, say, depleting some limited resource, it becomes easy to start viewing our neighbors as competitors, taking us right back to the ingroup vs. outgroup mindset that we all know causes big problems. So as long as there's self interest, there's gonna be conflict. But before you get all down on humanity, remember those Robber's Cave boys. They were ready

to go full-on Lord of the Flies before shared goals forced them to cooperate and ultimately, make peace. The power of cooperation to make friends of former enemies is one of the most hopeful areas of psychological research. If greed and self-interest can destroy the world, perhaps cooperation can save it. Today, you learned about the Robber's Cave experiment and what it taught us about realistic conflict theory and how shared goals can overcome conflict. We looked at the physical and environmental triggers of aggression, and the frustration-aggression hypothesis. You also learned about altruism, the bystander effect, and when we are more or less likely to help a person in need, and also about the social exchange theory, the reciprocity norm, the social responsibility

norm, and social traps. Thanks for watching, especially to all of our Subbable subscribers who make Crash Course possible.

### Transcript (reading)

What do you see in this image? A scary face? A couple of squirrels fighting? Or this one? A squashed frog? Or tumbling poodles? A bleeding bat? Hermann Rorschach wants to know. Eh, he wanted to know–he's dead now He believed that your answers, what you saw in the ink, said something about your personality. Rorschach was a Swiss psychoanalyst who, in his youth, was fascinated by the childhood game of making pictures out of inkblots called klecksography As an adult, Rorschach was intrigued with Carl Jung's use of word association in attempts to access patients' unconscious minds. Jung would ask patients to say the first thing that came to mind when they saw words like "dead" or "window" or "abuse" and Rorschach thought, "Why not do the same thing with amorphous blobs?"

So he'd show a patient a series of ink blots and record what they saw to determine how people "projected" their personal associations onto random shapes. Assuming there are important differences between those who saw dancing bunnies versus those who saw severed, screaming heads, he drew conclusions about a patient's personality. And yeah, this was controversial. Some clinicians still do think that Rorschach test can be a helpful diagnostic tool when used correctly and cautiously. But others remain critical of the test, calling them unscientific and unreliable. It's even been called "the Dracula of psychological tests" because no one has been able to drive a stake through its heart yet.

So I guess this is that part when I apologize for the set design. Sorry. But love it or hate it, the Rorschach test is one of the many methods psychologists have used in an ongoing quest to understand personality. And of all of the concepts we cover in this course, personality is one of the most complex, and one of the most contested. This is where we bring in the household names. Not just Rorschach, but Freud, and Jung, as well as other influential thinkers like Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers. It's where some of the most familiar concepts in early psychology come into play, ones that people with even passing knowledge of the field have heard of: the ego, the Oedipus complex, penis envy, inferiority complexes, even the idea of self-help itself.

Whether you've heard of these as hard facts or simply as historical curiosities, these notions represent the starting points for some of the biggest and most compelling questions in the field. But they all come back to the same question: What makes us who we are? ♪ [Crash Course intro] ♪ We always gotta start out with defining things. Personality. You think you know what that means, but we're gonna define it as your distinctive and enduring characteristic patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving. And psychologists typically study personality in two broad ways: 1. By trying to understand differences in specific characteristics, like introvertedness versus extrovertedness.

And 2. By looking at how all the various parts of each person mesh together as a whole. Basically, what are our characteristics and how do they combine to make me me and you you? And guess what? As you might expect, there are a number of competing perspectives on personality theory. 4 to be exact. The first, and one of the most influential has been the psychoanalytic perspective, first championed by our coke-loving, cigar-chewing friend, Sigmund Freud. It was through his clinical observation of patients that Freud came to theorize the existence of the unconscious. For Freud, the unconscious represented a vast reservoir of often unacceptable and frequently hard-to-tolerate thoughts, feelings, desires, and memories.

Usually involving a lots of weird sex stuff. You gotta point out, by the way, that the Freudian unconscious is a different thing from the contemporary idea of non-conscious information processing when we're, like, processing information that we don't know we're processing. Freud's thing is, you know, a lot more titillating, but, the non-conscious is like empirically validated a real thing that we study now. Anyway, Freud believed that our personalities are largely shaped by the enduring conflict between our impulses to do whatever we feel like, and our restraint to control those urges between our pleasure-seeking aggressive urges and our inner social control over them. He theorized our minds as being divided into three interacting parts— the id, the ego, and the superego—

that provide the battleground for this internal conflict that shaped our personalities. You can think of the classic Freudian mind like this iceberg. It's mostly hidden, and that big underwater chunk is your id: your unconscious, primitive, and instinctive self. Freud thought the id was all about sex and agression, the so-called pleasure principle of immediate gratification. To him, infants were all id. That's in part why babies freak out when they don't get a snack like "Right now!", instead of just taking a deep breath for a second. For that matter, a lot of the off-the-wall celebrities and dictators are big ids. The id's like a honey badger—they don't care. Eventually kids develop the ego part of their personality,

that largely conscious component that's charged with dealing with reality. The ego works on getting the id what it wants in a reasonable, timely, and realistic way without, you know, getting arrested or beaten up. The final aspect to form in Freud's personality trifecta is the superego, the Jiminy Cricket of voice of our conscience that represents not just the real, but also the ideal. As you can imagine, the superego and the id don't much like each other, and it's up the the Referee Ego to sort everything out. And it's hard to be the ego. Freud believed that anxiety comes in part from the ego getting all stressed out about losing control over the id and superego. So he proposed that our egos use a series of indirect and unconscious defense mechanisms to protect themselves from this fear.

And each person's particular configuration of defense mechanisms, in turn, makes up part of what we're referring to here as personality. You might already have heard of repression, the defense that's thought to work by banishing any thoughts, feelings, or memories that cause anxiety to the unconscious. And repression, Freud thought, allows our many other defense mechanisms to do their work. Regression, for example, involves a retreat to a more infantile psychosexual stage, like, when a second-grader sucks their thumb when they're nervous. Reaction formation is kinda like passive-aggression. It involves flipping unacceptable impulses like desire to punch someone in the face with their opposites, like offering them cookies with a fake smile.

Projection is when you disguise your own impulses by calling them out in other people, and rationalization is just what it sounds like, when we offer explanations and excuses for our behaviors instead of getting to the real unconscious reasons. Like, "Yeah, well, I ate six hot pockets at the party just 'cause I was being social!" Displacement is the typical you got yelled at by your boss, and then came home and yelled at your roommate. It's when you shift your impulses toward a less threatening victim. And then there's denial, which is when you refuse to believe or sometimes even perceive some kind of painful reality. Like, "No, my boyfriend isn't cheating on me." and "I'm not gonna fail that class," and "These pants TOTALLY STILL FIT!"

Our defense mechanisms, as theorized by Freud, are pretty tied in with our personalities. Someone who engages in a lot of denial and not as much projection would probably look and act a lot differently from someone who chronically does the reverse. Still, Freud was convince our personalities form in our first few years as we pass through a series of five psychosexual stages, essentially during which the id seeks to get its rocks off in different pleasure-sensitive areas. Infants start out in the oral stage because they get pleasure from eating. From there, a child enters the anal stage, focused on peeing and pooping; then on to the phallic stage, as they discover their boy and girl bits.

It was during this stage that Freud believed the infamous Oedipus complex reared up, characterized by a boy experiencing a form of sexual desire toward his mother and a parallel jealousy or hatred of his father. Freud called from about age 6 to puberty the latency stage, marked by dormant sexual feelings which eventually evolved into the fifth and final, adult, genital stage of mature sexual interests. Now, he believed if certain conflicts weren't resolved in any of these given stages, a person could develop a fixation, or a lingering focus on a younger stage. Like if a baby was overfed or neglected and underfed, they might be fixate in the oral stage; an orally fixated adult might seek oral gratification through excessive eating or chain smoking

and may develop issues with dependency or aggression. Now of course, not everyone was on board with Freud's model of personality development. Many of his ideas were controversial and remain so to this day; even most modern psychoanalysts now dispute the whole Oedipal thing. In fact, while many pioneering psychoanalysts built on Freud's theories -- these are so-called neo-Freudians -- many disagree with lots of his ideas, and instead either emphasize the role of the conscious mind or focus on non-sexual motivations. Take Karen Horney, for instance, a German-born psychoanalyst credited with founding feminist psychology. She wasn't down with the idea that our personalities are primarily shaped by sex and aggression.

She especially rejected the notion of penis envy, which she thought was more than a little insulting to women. She actually proposed that womb envy may occur as much in men who were envious they can't give birth. She encouraged patients to take charge of their own mental health and engage in self-help and analysis, believing people were often able to sorta be their own therapists. We mentioned Carl Jung, the famous Swiss psychoanalyst. Jung was a friend and disciple of Freud, but eventually, theoretical differences took them in different directions. He agreed that the unconscious was a powerful force, but he believed it was more than just a holding cell for repressed sexual thoughts and feelings and memories.

Jung believed sexual drive was only part of the equation, and that we're also driven by a need to achieve a full knowledge of self. He also suggested that we have a collective unconscious, a group of shared images or archetypes that are universal to all humans, and this was why different cultures share similar myths and imagery. Vienna-born Alfred Adler was another former collaborator of Freud who struck out on his own. Adler agreed with Freud that childhood was important, but he emphasized ongoing social tensions, not sexual ones, as most crucial to the formation of personality. He coined the term "inferiority complex" and believed that much of our adult behavior is linked to childhood struggles with feeling inferior.

In the end, not all of their their theories have endured, but Freud and his contemporaries were key to the evolution of psychoanalytic theory because they explored ways in which our mental life and personality may be submerged beneath the veil of consciousness. But the psychoanalytical approach is only one perspective on what makes us who we are. Rather than focuseing on how messed up we can be, humanistic theorists focus on the basic goodness of people and how they strive to achieve their full potential. In other words, they believe in the potential for personal growth. Abraham Maslow is one of these guys; he believed we're motivated by that pyramid-shaped hierarchy of needs and that once basic needs are met, like food and shelter and whatnot, we're able to achieve higher goals.

Maslow believed the top two rungs of that pyramid are where the real growth in personality takes place. First, with self-actualization, or the need to live up to our full, unique potential, and then with self-transcendence, or finding meaning and purpose and identity beyond ourselves. Rather than study only troubled patients, Maslow look at healthy, creative types with whom he discovered this common thread of self-actualization. Bolstered by a secure sense of self, these people were more sure of themselves, more compassionate, caring, driven, and uneasy around cruelty and pettiness. American psychologist, Carl Rogers, was another pioneer of humanistic theory, who proposed a person-centered perspective on personality.

Like Maslow, Rogers believed we're all basically good eggs so long as we're nurtured in a growth-promoting environment that he thought required three conditions. The first is genuineness. Just the idea that parents and teachers should be transparent and open with their feelings. Then, there's acceptance; when folks are accepting, people around them won't be afraid to be themselves or make mistakes. And the third requirement, according to Rogers, is empathy, or the ability to share others' feelings and reflect their meanings. Rogers thought of these traits as the nutrients required to make a personality grow into a healthy self-concept, that mix of thoughts and feelings that answer the fundamental question, who am I?

So, psychoanalytic and humanistic theories of personality were and are incredibly influential, even if one was a little sorted, and the other, a little sunshine and rainbows. But they didn't always lend themselves to clear measurement, and as empirical standards began to take hold in the mid-20th century, this became a major concern. How did we deal with that? Well, tune in next week when we explore some of the newer ways of looking at personality and how we started measuring it. Today, you learned about personality theory and two of its early schools of thought: the psychoanalytic theory, including Freud's three-part model of the mind and defense mechanisms, along with the neo-Freudians.

You also learned about the humanistic theory, including Maslow's model of self-actualization and Roger's person-centered perspective.

- [00:00] What do you see in this image?
- [00:01] A scary face?
- [00:02] A couple of squirrels fighting?
- [00:04] Or this one?
- [00:04] A squashed frog?
- [00:05] Or tumbling poodles?
- [00:07] A bleeding bat?
- [00:08] Hermann Rorschach wants to know.
- [00:10] Eh, he wanted to know–he's dead now
- [00:12] He believed that your answers, what you saw in the ink, said something about your personality.
- [00:16] Rorschach was a Swiss psychoanalyst who, in his youth, was fascinated
- [00:20] by the childhood game of making pictures out of inkblots called klecksography
- [00:25] As an adult, Rorschach was intrigued with Carl Jung's use of word association
- [00:29] in attempts to access patients' unconscious minds.
- [00:32] Jung would ask patients to say the first thing that came to mind
- [00:35] when they saw words like
- [00:36] "dead"
- [00:36] or "window"
- [00:37] or "abuse"
- [00:38] and Rorschach thought,
- [00:39] "Why not do the same thing with amorphous blobs?"
- [00:41] So he'd show a patient a series of ink blots and record what they saw
- [00:45] to determine how people "projected" their personal associations onto random shapes.
- [00:49] Assuming there are important differences between those who saw
- [00:52] dancing bunnies versus those who saw severed, screaming heads,
- [00:55] he drew conclusions about a patient's personality.
- [00:58] And yeah, this was controversial.
- [01:00] Some clinicians still do think that Rorschach test can be a helpful diagnostic tool
- [01:03] when used correctly and cautiously.
- [01:06] But others remain critical of the test, calling them unscientific and unreliable.
- [01:10] It's even been called "the Dracula of psychological tests"
- [01:13] because no one has been able to drive a stake through its heart yet.
- [01:16] So I guess this is that part when I apologize for the set design.
- [01:19] Sorry.
- [01:20] But love it or hate it, the Rorschach test is one of the many methods
- [01:22] psychologists have used in an ongoing quest to understand personality.
- [01:26] And of all of the concepts we cover in this course, personality is one of the most complex,
- [01:30] and one of the most contested.
- [01:32] This is where we bring in the household names.
- [01:34] Not just Rorschach, but Freud, and Jung,
- [01:36] as well as other influential thinkers like Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers.
- [01:41] It's where some of the most familiar concepts in early psychology come into play,
- [01:43] ones that people with even passing knowledge of the field have heard of:
- [01:47] the ego, the Oedipus complex, penis envy, inferiority complexes, even the idea of self-help itself.
- [01:53] Whether you've heard of these as hard facts or simply as historical curiosities,
- [01:57] these notions represent the starting points for some of the biggest and most compelling questions in the field.
- [02:02] But they all come back to the same question:
- [02:04] What makes us who we are?
- [02:07] ♪ [Crash Course intro] ♪
- [02:16] We always gotta start out with defining things. Personality. You think you know what that means,
- [02:21] but we're gonna define it as your distinctive and enduring characteristic patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving.
- [02:26] And psychologists typically study personality in two broad ways:
- [02:29] 1. By trying to understand differences in specific characteristics,
- [02:33] like introvertedness versus extrovertedness.
- [02:36] And 2. By looking at how all the various parts of each person mesh together as a whole.
- [02:40] Basically, what are our characteristics and how do they combine to make me me and you you?
- [02:46] And guess what?
- [02:47] As you might expect, there are a number of competing perspectives on personality theory.
- [02:52] 4 to be exact.
- [02:53] The first, and one of the most influential has been the psychoanalytic perspective,
- [02:56] first championed by our coke-loving, cigar-chewing friend, Sigmund Freud.
- [03:00] It was through his clinical observation of patients that
- [03:02] Freud came to theorize the existence of the unconscious.
- [03:05] For Freud, the unconscious represented a vast reservoir
- [03:08] of often unacceptable and frequently hard-to-tolerate thoughts, feelings, desires, and memories.
- [03:13] Usually involving a lots of weird sex stuff.
- [03:16] You gotta point out, by the way,
- [03:16] that the Freudian unconscious is a different thing
- [03:19] from the contemporary idea of non-conscious information processing
- [03:22] when we're, like, processing information that we don't know we're processing.
- [03:26] Freud's thing is, you know, a lot more titillating,
- [03:28] but, the non-conscious is like empirically validated a real thing that we study now.
- [03:33] Anyway, Freud believed that our personalities are largely shaped by the enduring conflict
- [03:37] between our impulses to do whatever we feel like, and our restraint to control those urges
- [03:42] between our pleasure-seeking aggressive urges and our inner social control over them.
- [03:47] He theorized our minds as being divided into three interacting parts—
- [03:51] the id, the ego, and the superego—
- [03:53] that provide the battleground for this internal conflict that shaped our personalities.
- [03:58] You can think of the classic Freudian mind like this iceberg.
- [04:00] It's mostly hidden, and that big underwater chunk is your id:
- [04:04] your unconscious, primitive, and instinctive self.
- [04:07] Freud thought the id was all about sex and agression,
- [04:09] the so-called pleasure principle of immediate gratification.
- [04:13] To him, infants were all id.
- [04:15] That's in part why babies freak out when they don't get a snack like "Right now!",
- [04:19] instead of just taking a deep breath for a second.
- [04:21] For that matter, a lot of the off-the-wall celebrities and dictators are big ids.
- [04:25] The id's like a honey badger—they don't care.
- [04:27] Eventually kids develop the ego part of their personality,
- [04:30] that largely conscious component that's charged with dealing with reality.
- [04:34] The ego works on getting the id what it wants in a reasonable, timely, and realistic way
- [04:38] without, you know, getting arrested or beaten up.
- [04:41] The final aspect to form in Freud's personality trifecta is the superego,
- [04:45] the Jiminy Cricket of voice of our conscience that represents not just the real, but also the ideal.
- [04:50] As you can imagine, the superego and the id don't much like each other,
- [04:53] and it's up the the Referee Ego to sort everything out.
- [04:56] And it's hard to be the ego.
- [04:57] Freud believed that anxiety comes in part from the ego getting all stressed out about losing control
- [05:02] over the id and superego.
- [05:03] So he proposed that our egos use a series of indirect and unconscious defense mechanisms
- [05:08] to protect themselves from this fear.

- [06:21] Our defense mechanisms, as theorized by Freud, are pretty tied in with our personalities.
- [06:25] Someone who engages in a lot of denial and not as much projection would probably look and act

opportunities trait theory researchers look to define personality through stable and lasting behavior patterns and conscious motivations legend has it that it all began in 1919 when young American psychologist Gordon Allport paid a visit to none other than Freud himself Allport was telling Freud about his journey there on the train and how there was this little boy who was obsessed with staying clean and didn't want to sit next to anyone or touch anything Albert wondered if the boy's mother had a kind of dirt phobia that had rubbed off on him so yeah yeah yeah he's telling his tale and at the end of it Freud looks at him and says hmm was that little boy you all port was basically like no man that was just some kid on the train don't try to make this into

some big unconscious episode from my repressed childhood Allport thought Freud was digging a little too deep and that sometimes you just need to look at motives in the present not the past to describe behavior so all-ports started his own Club describing personality in terms of fundamental traits or characteristics and conscious motives it wasn't so much interested in explaining traits as he was in describing them modern trait researchers like Robert McRae and Paul Costa have since organized our fundamental characteristics into what's casually known as the big five openness conscientiousness extraversion agreeableness and neuroticism which you can remember using the mnemonic ocean or canoe whichever one you prefer each of these traits exists on a spectrum so for example your level of

openness can range on one end from being totally open to new things in variety or one thing strict regular routine on the other end your degree of conscientiousness can translate into being impulsive and care lists are careful and disciplined someone high on the extraversion in will be sociable while those on the low end will be shy and reserved a very agreeable person meanwhile is helpful and trusting while someone at the opposite end may be suspicious or uncooperative and finally on the neuroticism spectrum an emotionally stable person will be more calm and secure while a less stable person is often anxious insecure and self-pitying the important idea here is that these traits are hypothesized to predict behavior and attitude like an introvert might prefer communicating through email

more than an extroverted and agreeable person is much more likely to help their neighbor move that couch then a suspicious one who's just glaring through the window my adulthood trait theorists will tell you these characteristics are pretty stable but isn't to say that they can't flex a little in different situations like that same shy person might end up singing Elvis karaoke in a room full of people under the right conditions so our personality traits are better predicting our average behavior than what we do in any specific situation and research indicates that some traits like neuroticism seem to be better predictors of behavior than others this flexibility that we all seem to have leads to the fourth major theory on personality the

social cognitive perspective originally proposed by our Bovo beading friend alfred bandura the social cognitive school emphasizes the interaction between our traits and their social context ventura noted that we learn a lot of our behavior by watching and imitating others that's the social part of the equation but we also think a lot about how these social interactions affect our behavior which is the cognitive part so in this way people and their situations basically work together to create behavior bandura referred to this sort of interplay as reciprocal determinism meaning that for example the kind of books you read or music you listen to or friends you hang out with say something about your personality because different people choose to be in

different environments and then those environments in turn continue to reinforce our personalities so if Bernice has a kind of anxious suspicious personality and she has a serious Titanic crush on Sherlock Holmes she might be extra attuned to potentially dangerous or fishy situations the more she sees the world in that way the more anxious and suspicious she gets in this way we're both the creators and the products of the situation's we surround ourselves with that's why one of the key indicators of personality in this school of thought has to do with our sense of personal control that is the extent to which you perceive that you have control over your environment someone who believes that they control their own fate or make

their own luck is said to have an internal locus of control while those who feel like they're just guided by forces beyond their control are said to have an external locus now whether we're talking about control versus helplessness introversion versus extraversion calm versus anxious or whatever each of these different personality perspectives have their own methods of testing and measuring personality we talked before about how the psychoanalyst super hunk Hermann Rorschach used his ink blot test to infer information about a person's personality we know that Freud used dream analysis and both he and Young were fans of free association the broader school of theorists now known as the psychodynamic camp that descended from Freud and pals also use other projective psychological

tests including the famous Thematic Apperception tests in this kind of test you'd be presented with evocative but ambiguous pictures and then asked to provide information about them you might be asked to tell a story about the scenes considering things like how are the characters feeling or what's going on or what happened before this event and what will happen after like check it out is the woman crying because her brother just died from a bee sting or is she a maid laughing because some royal just passed out drunk in his bed or perhaps the object of her long burning affection has just confessed his love and a fever hazel jane austen style and she's having a mini breakdown in the hall the idea is that your responses will reveal something about your

concerns and motivations in real life or how you see the world or about your unconscious processes that drive you by contrast with that approach though modern trait personality researchers believe that you can assess personality traits by having people answer a series of test questions there are lots of so called personality trait inventories out there some provide a quick reading on a particular enduring trait like anxiety or self-esteem while others gauge a wide range of traits like our friends the Big Five these tests like the myers-briggs which you might have heard of involve long questionnaires of true false or agree/disagree questions like do you enjoy being the center of attention do you find it easy to empathize with

others or do you value justice over mercy but the classic Minnesota multiphasic personality inventory is probably the most widely used personality test the most recent version asks a series of five in 67 true/false questions varying from no one seems to understand me too I like mechanics magazines too I loved my father and is often used to identify emotional disorders and there's how bandura's social cognitive camp sizes you up because this school of thought emphasizes the interaction of environment and behavior rather than just traits alone they aren't solely into questions and answers instead they might measure personality in different contexts understanding behavior in one situation is best predicted by how you acted in a similar situation like if Bernice

freaked out and tried to hide under the bed during the last five thunderstorms we can predict the chip will do that again next time and if we conducted a controlled lab experiment where say we looked at the effects of thunderstorm noises on people's behavior we might get an even better sense of what baseline psychological factors could best predict storm induced freak-outs and finally there are the humanistic theorists like Maslow they often reject standardized assessments altogether instead they tend to measure your self-concept through therapy interviews and questionnaires that asked subjects to describe both how they would ideally like to be and how they actually are the idea is that the closer the actual and ideal are the more positive the subjects sense of self

which brings us back to that biggest motherlode question of them all who or what is the self all the books out there about self esteem self-help self awareness self control and so on are built upon one assumption that the self is the organizer of our thoughts and feelings and actions essentially the center of a personality but of course it's a sticky issue one way to think about self is through the concept of possible selves like your ideal self perhaps devastatingly attractive and intelligent successful and well loved as well as your most feared self the one who could end up unemployed and lonely and run down this balance of potential best and worst selves motivates us through life. In the end, once you factor in environment and childhood experiences,

culture, and all that mess, not to mention biology, which we haven't even touched on today, can we really firmly define self or answer certainly that we even have one? That, my friend, is one of life's biggest questions, insofar as it has yet to be universally answered. But you learned a lot, anyway, today, right? As we've talked about the trait and social cognitive perspectives and also about different ways these schools and others measure and test personality we also talked about what self is and how our self-esteem works thanks for watching especially to our subbable subscribers who make crash course possible to find out how you can become a supporter just go to subbable.com/crashcourse this episode was written by Kathleen Yale edited by Blake de pastino and our consultant is

- [02:17] stable and lasting behavior patterns and conscious motivations legend has it that
- [02:21] it all began in 1919 when young American psychologist Gordon Allport paid a visit
- [02:26] to none other than Freud himself Allport was telling Freud about his
- [02:30] journey there on the train and how there was this little boy who was obsessed
- [02:34] with staying clean and didn't want to sit next to anyone or touch anything
- [02:37] Albert wondered if the boy's mother had a kind of dirt phobia that had rubbed
- [02:42] off on him so yeah yeah yeah he's telling his tale and at the end of it
- [02:45] Freud looks at him and says hmm was that little boy you all port was basically
- [02:50] like no man that was just some kid on the train don't try to make this into
- [02:54] some big unconscious episode from my repressed childhood
- [02:57] Allport thought Freud was digging a little too deep and that sometimes you
- [03:00] just need to look at motives in the present not the past to describe
- [03:04] behavior so all-ports started his own Club describing personality in terms of
- [03:08] fundamental traits or characteristics and conscious motives it wasn't so much
- [03:13] interested in explaining traits as he was in describing them modern trait
- [03:16] researchers like Robert McRae and Paul Costa have since organized our
- [03:19] fundamental characteristics into what's casually known as the big five openness
- [03:24] conscientiousness extraversion agreeableness and neuroticism which you
- [03:28] can remember using the mnemonic ocean or canoe whichever one you prefer
- [03:33] each of these traits exists on a spectrum so for example your level of
- [03:36] openness can range on one end from being totally open to new things in variety or
- [03:41] one thing strict regular routine on the other end your degree of
- [03:44] conscientiousness can translate into being impulsive and care
- [03:47] lists are careful and disciplined someone high on the extraversion in will
- [03:51] be sociable while those on the low end will be shy and reserved a very
- [03:55] agreeable person meanwhile is helpful and trusting while someone at the
- [03:58] opposite end may be suspicious or uncooperative and finally on the
- [04:01] neuroticism spectrum an emotionally stable person will be more calm and
- [04:05] secure while a less stable person is often anxious insecure and self-pitying
- [04:10] the important idea here is that these traits are hypothesized to predict

- [04:17] more than an extroverted and agreeable person is much more likely to help their

- [04:25] characteristics are pretty stable but isn't to say that they can't flex a
- [04:29] little in different situations like that same shy person might end up singing
- [04:33] Elvis karaoke in a room full of people under the right conditions so our
- [04:36] personality traits are better predicting our average behavior than what we do in
- [04:40] any specific situation and research indicates that some traits like
- [04:43] neuroticism seem to be better predictors of behavior than others this flexibility
- [04:47] that we all seem to have leads to the fourth major theory on personality the

- [04:59] between our traits and their social context ventura noted that we learn a
- [05:03] lot of our behavior by watching and imitating others that's the social part
- [05:06] of the equation but we also think a lot about how these social interactions
- [05:10] affect our behavior which is the cognitive part so in this way people and
- [05:14] their situations basically work together to create behavior bandura referred to
- [05:18] this sort of interplay as reciprocal determinism meaning that for example the
- [05:23] kind of books you read or music you listen to or friends you hang out with
- [05:26] say something about your personality because different people choose to be in
- [05:30] different environments and then those environments in turn continue to
- [05:34] reinforce our personalities so if Bernice has a kind of anxious suspicious
- [05:38] personality and she has a serious Titanic crush on Sherlock Holmes she
- [05:41] might be extra attuned to potentially dangerous or fishy situations the more
- [05:46] she sees the world in that way the more anxious and suspicious she gets in this
- [05:49] way we're both the creators and the products of the situation's we surround
- [05:54] ourselves with that's why one of the key indicators of personality in this school

### Transcript (reading)

People have been having sex and writing songs about it and carving statues of it and changing fashion for it since the dawn of humanity, but it wasn't until fairly recently in the 1940s that serious Western scientific study of sex began. And by most accounts you can thank one guy for that: Alfred Kinsey. Kinsey was born in 1894 in New Jersey, to poor strict Methodist parents. He studied etymology in college, graduated with degrees in biology and psychology before heading to Harvard. His doctoral thesis was on the genealogy of Gall wasps, a subject he tackled with intensity; meticulously collecting over five million samples, measuring hundreds of thousands of specimens. And wasps are interesting and everything, but Kinsey's interests drifted toward human

sexuality and his research in Indiana University paved the way for decades of study into sex. He surveyed thousands of men and women about their sexual habits and histories, and found all sorts of interesting things related to sexual preferences, masturbation, orgasms, and pre-marital sex. He established the "Kinsey scale" indicating degrees of sexual orientation) and went on to write the seminal texts on sexual behavior in the human male and female respectively. Like many researchers of human behavior, Kinsey and his colleagues were - and in some ways still are - pretty controversial. But he definitely succeeded in two very important tasks. One: he was an early adopter of a scientific approach to studying sex, and two: he showed

that the popular perception of what people do and don't do sexually, versus what people actually do and feel, was often very different. Since then we've seen innumerable sex-related studies examining the physiological and psychological and social elements of sex. And, there's a whole lot of lingering misinformation and judging morality swirling around the subject of sex. It can be a tricky topic for sure but we are here to clear some things up. It's the entire purpose of life so there's no reason to blush. So. Sex. That one little word has complicated so many lives. The desire for or lack of sex has spawned poetry and made babies and transmitted diseases and cost money and driven people batty and kept late-night cable in business.

Even the word itself can mean many different things. First we've got the verb kind of sex, the physical process of engaging in sexual acts and intercourse, which, probably I don't need to describe to you. Then we've got the biological definition, having to do with the anatomical parts that go with the designations of male or female or intersex - those who were born with the reproductive parts that don't fall into the predominant definitions of male or female. And these are quite separate from gender, or an individual's sense of identifying as male or female or another gender identity regardless of how that corresponds with their actual reproductive plumbing. For transgender people, for instance, gender identity typically doesn't match biological sex.

And remember that gender identity is completely different from sexual orientation, which we'll talk about in a minute. So beyond definitions, we have the physiological and psychological aspects of sex. Let's start with the physiological, and with that, Masters and Johnson. In the late 1950's and 60's, American gynecologists Williams Masters, and his collaborator and future wife, sexologist Virginia Johnson, did something no researchers had ever done before. They invited nearly 700 male and female volunteers, many of them sex workers, to come into their lab and get it on, either alone or with their partners. Their aim? To record the body's physiological response to sex. This involved wearing a whole lot of wires and heart monitors and such, and is probably about as sexy as it sounds.

All the volunteers had to be willing and able to show arousal and be capable of orgasm. And over the years, Masters and Johnson recorded more than ten thousand "sexual cycles". The main thing they documented was that a complete sexual response cycle involved four distinct stages - excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution - which Masters and Johnson maintained happened in a linear way, one after the other. In the excitement phase, things are gettin' goin', blood is rushing to all the necessary places, genital areas are becoming engorged and secreting lubricant. Next comes the plateau phase. Pulse, blood pressure, and breathing rates keep increasing and genitals are becoming fully engorged.

The penis is often secreting pre-ejaculate as vaginal secretions increase until the big event orgasm during which muscles all over the body contract and breathing and pulse rates hit their peak. Of course, a biological male orgasm typically releases sperm that may lead to fertilization, depending on the situation, but female arousal and orgasm also help facilitate conception, again depending on the situation as those muscle contractions and lubrication help draw up and retain sperm in the uterus. Finally, the body comes back down to its normal state of affairs during the resolution phase. It's during this phase that biosex males enter a refractory period during which they're unable to orgasm again for a few minutes to a day or more whereas biological females refractory

period is very short in comparison. While the four stage model of sexual response is still taught today, some have criticized both its rigid linear setup, arguing that things don't always work so tidily in the bedroom, and it's insistence in including orgasm which doesn't happen for everyone all the time. Others also question the model's clinical focus on only physiological factors arguing the cultural attitudes, psychological and relationship factors, and other external details should also be considered when looking at sexual response. I'll get back to that in a minute, but before we move on to the psychology of sex, we got to talk about hormones. You remember hormones, those chemical messengers brewed up by the endocrine system that travel

through the bloodstream and regulate all sorts of physiological and behavioral activities from growth to digestion to sleep to sex. Our sex hormones serve two major purposes. One, they direct the physical development of biological sex characteristics, and two, they help activate sexual behavior. Estrogens like estradiol contribute to female sex characteristics and are secreted in greater amounts by females than males and while all humans make testosterone, it's the predominate sex hormone for males, stimulating the growth and development of male sex characteristics. Now most female mammals become sexually receptive when their estrogens peak during ovulation, but it doesn't really work that way for humans.

Our hormones are more loosely related to sexual behavior, although studies have found that in general female's sexual desire spikes slightly around ovulation, when woman are most fertile and males can also be affected by this spike, responding with higher levels of testosterone when ovulating women are around. But these short term changes hardly compare to the larger more major hormonal shifts that occur throughout a life time. Puberty, for one, tends to get everyone a lot more hot and bothered and interested in dating and gazing at posters of their favorite celebrity crushes and later in life, as sex hormone production normally decreases, our amorous urges and endeavors tend to decrease as well.

Age affects our libido. But in the end you might think of sex hormones as fuel for your sexual engine, and while an engine can't run on a totally empty tank, it also won't run any better or worse on a full tank versus a half tank. We need our sex hormones, but we also need the right psychological stimuli to turn us on and keep us going sexually. So, finally, let's look at some of these psychological aspects of sex. First, there are the very important social and cultural influences. Things like your families, your societies, your religions, and your personal values. Does your community view sex merely as the means for reproduction or can it be fun too? What are the views on premarital sex, and homosexuality, showing some skin or kissing in public?

Then there are the influences of external stimuli. In western society, we're constantly bombarded with sexually charged content from movies and TV to advertisements, R&B slow jams, and Victoria Secret catalogs. And constantly looking at images of things that you find extremely attractive can lead to folks viewing more average people, even their own partners, as being less attractive. But our sexual desire is also fueled by internal stimuli. Our imagination and memories and fantasies. According to plenty of studies, at least 95% of people fantasize about sex at some point. The thing you need to keep in mind is that none of these factors work independently of each other. How we respond to both external and internal stimuli can be really heavily influenced by

social and cultural factors, and that is where a lot of the thinking and studying of sex has gotten really complicated. Human judgment and morality is often entangled with sex and desire and sadly, a lot of people have been made to feel miserable for liking certain things or being attracted to certain people. There's also just been a lot of misinformation out there. For ages, a lot of folks believed that masturbation could make you go blind, become mentally ill, or kill the neighborhood kittens. It doesn't do that. And as I know, you're thinking right now one area of sexuality has been needlessly associated with conflict, fear, and shame in many cultures is sexual orientation.

For our purposes, sexual orientation can be defined as a relatively enduring physical or romantic attraction to another person. Heterosexual, homosexual, and bisexual are all types of sexual orientation. And although the field once stigmatized non-heterosexual orientations, we now know that homosexuality and bisexuality are in no way related to mental health. Psychologists are also beginning to look more in depth at other sexual orientations. For instance, Asexuality or nonsexuality, where no sexual attraction of any kind is experienced. In any case, whether a culture itself is friendly to or tyrannical against any of these orientations, all types prevail. Sexual orientation is neither chosen nor changed.

So, what might cause these differences? Hopefully you already know this but it's worth repeating. There's no evidence that sexual orientation is determined by things like dominating mother or passive father or sex hormone levels in your adult body or your history of childhood abuse or whether your parents were gay or straight. In other words, decades of research have led most researchers to believed that once you're born, there are no clear environmental factors that influence your sexual orientation. And there's been a lot of research into possible biological components of sexual orientation, like genetics, brain anatomy, prenatal conditions, or other things. It's also important to know that we're far from understanding sexual orientation on a purely biological level.

If anything, the evidence we've got simply strengthens the idea that sexual orientation isn't choice, but rather a naturally varying occurrence among human beings, like height. So. After all this talk about sex, perhaps you're wondering why we do it at all. I mean, it feels good obviously. But the biggest function of sex goes beyond pure pleasure. In fact, sexual intimacy serves many of life's most basic purposes: some times procreation, but also stress reduction, maintaining healthy relationships, social bonding, and the expression of love, and overall fulfillment. People say he brain is the most significant sex organ for a reason. And intimacy is often its own reward. Today, you learned about Alfred Kinsey's ground breaking sex surveys, the differences between

how we define biological sex and gender identity, and about Masters and Johnson's four-part sexual response cycle. We also looked at the role of sex hormones, in our development and drive, how psychological and social factors play into sex, how we think about sexual orientation and why we have sex in the first place.

### Transcript (navigation)

- [00:00] People have been having sex and writing songs about it and carving statues of it and changing
- [00:05] fashion for it since the dawn of humanity, but it wasn't until fairly recently in the
- [00:10] 1940s that serious Western scientific study of sex began.
- [00:13] And by most accounts you can thank one guy for that: Alfred Kinsey.
- [00:18] Kinsey was born in 1894 in New Jersey, to poor strict Methodist parents.
- [00:23] He studied etymology in college, graduated with degrees in biology and psychology before
- [00:27] heading to Harvard.
- [00:28] His doctoral thesis was on the genealogy of Gall wasps, a subject he tackled with intensity;
- [00:34] meticulously collecting over five million samples, measuring hundreds of thousands of
- [00:39] specimens.
- [00:40] And wasps are interesting and everything, but Kinsey's interests drifted toward human
- [00:43] sexuality and his research in Indiana University paved the way for decades of study into sex.
- [00:49] He surveyed thousands of men and women about their sexual habits and histories, and found
- [00:53] all sorts of interesting things related to sexual preferences, masturbation, orgasms,
- [00:58] and pre-marital sex.
- [00:59] He established the "Kinsey scale" indicating degrees of sexual orientation) and went on
- [01:03] to write the seminal texts on sexual behavior in the human male and female respectively.
- [01:09] Like many researchers of human behavior, Kinsey and his colleagues were - and in some ways
- [01:13] still are - pretty controversial.
- [01:15] But he definitely succeeded in two very important tasks.
- [01:18] One: he was an early adopter of a scientific approach to studying sex, and two: he showed
- [01:23] that the popular perception of what people do and don't do sexually, versus what people
- [01:28] actually do and feel, was often very different.
- [01:32] Since then we've seen innumerable sex-related studies examining the physiological and psychological
- [01:36] and social elements of sex.
- [01:38] And, there's a whole lot of lingering misinformation and judging morality swirling around the subject
- [01:43] of sex.
- [01:44] It can be a tricky topic for sure but we are here to clear some things up.
- [01:48] It's the entire purpose of life so there's no reason to blush.
- [01:58] So.
- [02:01] Sex.
- [02:04] That one little word has complicated so many lives.
- [02:08] The desire for or lack of sex has spawned poetry and made babies and transmitted diseases
- [02:12] and cost money and driven people batty and kept late-night cable in business.
- [02:17] Even the word itself can mean many different things.
- [02:20] First we've got the verb kind of sex, the physical process of engaging in sexual acts
- [02:24] and intercourse, which, probably I don't need to describe to you.
- [02:27] Then we've got the biological definition, having to do with the anatomical parts that
- [02:31] go with the designations of male or female or intersex - those who were born with the
- [02:36] reproductive parts that don't fall into the predominant definitions of male or female.
- [02:39] And these are quite separate from gender, or an individual's sense of identifying as
- [02:43] male or female or another gender identity regardless of how that corresponds with their
- [02:48] actual reproductive plumbing.
- [02:50] For transgender people, for instance, gender identity typically doesn't match biological
- [02:54] sex.
- [02:55] And remember that gender identity is completely different from sexual orientation, which we'll
- [02:59] talk about in a minute.
- [03:00] So beyond definitions, we have the physiological and psychological aspects of sex.
- [03:05] Let's start with the physiological, and with that, Masters and Johnson.
- [03:09] In the late 1950's and 60's, American gynecologists Williams Masters, and his collaborator and
- [03:13] future wife, sexologist Virginia Johnson, did something no researchers had ever done
- [03:18] before.
- [03:19] They invited nearly 700 male and female volunteers, many of them sex workers, to come into their
- [03:24] lab and get it on, either alone or with their partners.
- [03:28] Their aim?
- [03:29] To record the body's physiological response to sex.
- [03:32] This involved wearing a whole lot of wires and heart monitors and such, and is probably
- [03:36] about as sexy as it sounds.
- [03:38] All the volunteers had to be willing and able to show arousal and be capable of orgasm.
- [03:42] And over the years, Masters and Johnson recorded more than ten thousand "sexual cycles".
- [03:47] The main thing they documented was that a complete sexual response cycle involved four
- [03:52] distinct stages - excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution - which Masters and Johnson
- [03:58] maintained happened in a linear way, one after the other.
- [04:02] In the excitement phase, things are gettin' goin', blood is rushing to all the necessary
- [04:06] places, genital areas are becoming engorged and secreting lubricant.
- [04:10] Next comes the plateau phase.
- [04:11] Pulse, blood pressure, and breathing rates keep increasing and genitals are becoming
- [04:15] fully engorged.
- [04:16] The penis is often secreting pre-ejaculate as vaginal secretions increase until the big
- [04:22] event orgasm during which muscles all over the body contract and breathing and pulse
- [04:27] rates hit their peak.
- [04:28] Of course, a biological male orgasm typically releases sperm that may lead to fertilization,
- [04:32] depending on the situation, but female arousal and orgasm also help facilitate conception,
- [04:38] again depending on the situation as those muscle contractions and lubrication help draw
- [04:42] up and retain sperm in the uterus.
- [04:44] Finally, the body comes back down to its normal state of affairs during the resolution phase.
- [04:48] It's during this phase that biosex males enter a refractory period during which they're unable
- [04:53] to orgasm again for a few minutes to a day or more whereas biological females refractory
- [04:58] period is very short in comparison.
- [05:00] While the four stage model of sexual response is still taught today, some have criticized
- [05:04] both its rigid linear setup, arguing that things don't always work so tidily in the
- [05:09] bedroom, and it's insistence in including orgasm which doesn't happen for everyone all
- [05:13] the time.
- [05:14] Others also question the model's clinical focus on only physiological factors arguing
- [05:18] the cultural attitudes, psychological and relationship factors, and other external details
- [05:23] should also be considered when looking at sexual response.
- [05:26] I'll get back to that in a minute, but before we move on to the psychology of sex, we got
- [05:30] to talk about hormones.
- [05:31] You remember hormones, those chemical messengers brewed up by the endocrine system that travel
- [05:36] through the bloodstream and regulate all sorts of physiological and behavioral activities
- [05:40] from growth to digestion to sleep to sex.
- [05:43] Our sex hormones serve two major purposes.
- [05:45] One, they direct the physical development of biological sex characteristics, and two,
- [05:50] they help activate sexual behavior.
- [05:53] Estrogens like estradiol contribute to female sex characteristics and are secreted in greater
- [05:57] amounts by females than males and while all humans make testosterone, it's the predominate
- [06:01] sex hormone for males, stimulating the growth and development of male sex characteristics.
- [06:06] Now most female mammals become sexually receptive when their estrogens peak during ovulation,
- [06:11] but it doesn't really work that way for humans.
- [06:14] Our hormones are more loosely related to sexual behavior, although studies have found that
- [06:18] in general female's sexual desire spikes slightly around ovulation, when woman are most fertile
- [06:23] and males can also be affected by this spike, responding with higher levels of testosterone
- [06:28] when ovulating women are around.
- [06:30] But these short term changes hardly compare to the larger more major hormonal shifts that
- [06:35] occur throughout a life time.
- [06:37] Puberty, for one, tends to get everyone a lot more hot and bothered and interested in
- [06:41] dating and gazing at posters of their favorite celebrity crushes and later in life, as sex
- [06:46] hormone production normally decreases, our amorous urges and endeavors tend to decrease
- [06:51] as well.
- [06:52] Age affects our libido.
- [06:53] But in the end you might think of sex hormones as fuel for your sexual engine, and while
- [06:58] an engine can't run on a totally empty tank, it also won't run any better or worse on a
- [07:03] full tank versus a half tank.
- [07:05] We need our sex hormones, but we also need the right psychological stimuli to turn us
- [07:10] on and keep us going sexually.
- [07:13] So, finally, let's look at some of these psychological aspects of sex.
- [07:17] First, there are the very important social and cultural influences.
- [07:21] Things like your families, your societies, your religions, and your personal values.
- [07:25] Does your community view sex merely as the means for reproduction or can it be fun too?
- [07:30] What are the views on premarital sex, and homosexuality, showing some skin or kissing
- [07:34] in public?
- [07:35] Then there are the influences of external stimuli.
- [07:37] In western society, we're constantly bombarded with sexually charged content from movies
- [07:42] and TV to advertisements, R&B slow jams, and Victoria Secret catalogs.
- [07:47] And constantly looking at images of things that you find extremely attractive can lead
- [07:51] to folks viewing more average people, even their own partners, as being less attractive.
- [07:56] But our sexual desire is also fueled by internal stimuli.
- [07:59] Our imagination and memories and fantasies.
- [08:02] According to plenty of studies, at least 95% of people fantasize about sex at some point.
- [08:06] The thing you need to keep in mind is that none of these factors work independently of
- [08:09] each other.
- [08:10] How we respond to both external and internal stimuli can be really heavily influenced by
- [08:15] social and cultural factors, and that is where a lot of the thinking and studying of sex
- [08:21] has gotten really complicated.
- [08:23] Human judgment and morality is often entangled with sex and desire and sadly, a lot of people
- [08:28] have been made to feel miserable for liking certain things or being attracted to certain
- [08:32] people.
- [08:33] There's also just been a lot of misinformation out there.
- [08:35] For ages, a lot of folks believed that masturbation could make you go blind, become mentally ill,
- [08:40] or kill the neighborhood kittens.
- [08:42] It doesn't do that.
- [08:44] And as I know, you're thinking right now one area of sexuality has been needlessly associated
- [08:48] with conflict, fear, and shame in many cultures is sexual orientation.

- [08:56] or romantic attraction to another person.

In February 1999, four New York City police officers were on patrol in the Bronx when they saw a young black man standing on a stoop. They thought he looked suspicious. When they pulled over, he retreated into the doorway and began digging in his pocket. He kept digging as the police shouted at him to show his hands; a few seconds later, the man, Amadou Diallo, a 23-year-old immigrant from Guinea, was dead, hit by 19 of the 41 bullets that the police fired at him. What Diallo was reaching for was his wallet. He was going for his ID as he stood on the steps of his own apartment building. Diallo's story, and the officer's fatal pre-judgment of him, is recounted in Malcolm Gladwell's 2005 bestseller Blink. Gladwell, and the social psychologists whose

work he draws upon, explores Diallo's case as an example of that grey area between deliberate violence and an accident, propagated by non-conscious, or implicit biases. The officers did discriminate against Diallo, but the prejudice they acted on may have been driven by something more subtle than simple hatred. And that's an important thing to think about. Yes, there are lots of overtly bigoted people and policies at work all over the world, but what we're interested in today is the more insidious, non-conscious automatic bias, and how it can affect our behavior. The fact is, our implicit biases affect the way we relate to others in a very real way. Our race, gender, age, religion, or sexual orientation can make the difference between

whether we get a job or not, a fair paycheck, or a good rental, or whether we get randomly pulled over or shot and killed for reaching for a wallet. In the last two episodes, we've examined how we think about and how we influence one another, but social psychology is also about how we relate to one another. Like what factors might cause us to help another person, or harm them, or fear them? What are the social, and cognitive, and emotional roots of prejudice, racism, and sexism, and how do they shape our society? These are some of the aspects of ourselves that are the hardest and most uncomfortable for us to explore, which is why they're so important to understand. We've all been unfairly judged in our time, and let's not pretend that we haven't done

our fair share of uninformed judging too. Like it or not, prejudice is a common human condition. Prejudice just means "prejudgment." It's an unjustified, typically negative attitude toward an individual or group. Prejudicial attitudes are often directed along the lines of gender, ethnic, socioeconomic status, or culture, and by definition, prejudice is not the same thing as stereotyping or discrimination, although the three phenomena are intimately related. People may distrust a female mechanic. That's a prejudicial attitude, but it's rooted in a stereotype, or over-generalized belief about a particular group. Although it's often discussed in a negative way, stereotyping is really more of a general cognitive process that doesn't have to be negative. It can even be accurate at times.

Like, I have the stereotype that all crows have wings, injuries and birth defects aside. And that happens to be true. But on the negative end, your prejudice against female mechanics may be rooted in some inaccurate stereotype about women's skills with a socket wrench. And when stereotypical beliefs combine with prejudicial attitudes and emotions, like fear and hostility, they can drive the behavior we call discrimination. So a prejudiced person won't necessarily act on their attitude. Say you believe in the stereotype that overweight people are lazy. You might then feel a prejudiced distaste when you see someone who appears overweight. But if you act on your prejudice, and, say, refuse to hire them for a job or don't let

them sit at your lunch counter, then you've crossed over into discriminating against them. The former apartheid system of racial segregation in South Africa, the Nazis' mass killing of Gypsies, Jewish people, and other groups, and centuries of bloodshed between Protestants and Catholics, are all extreme examples of violent prejudice and discrimination. The good news is that in many cultures, certain forms of overt prejudice have waned over time. For example, in 1937 only 1/3 of Americans said that they'd vote for a qualified woman to be president, while in 2007, that figure was up to nearly 90 percent. But of course more subtle prejudices can still linger. In the past, we've talked about dual-process theories of thought, memories, and attitudes,

and that while we're aware of our explicit thoughts, or implicit cognition still operates under the radar, leaving us clueless about its effect on our attitudes and behavior. In the same way, prejudice can be non-conscious and automatic. And I mean it can be so non-conscious that even when people ask us point-blank about our attitudes, we unwillingly or unknowingly don't always give them an honest answer. Do you think that men are better at science the women? Or that Muslims are more violent than Christians? Or that overweight people are unhealthy? Our tendency to unwittingly doctor our answers to questions like these is why we have the implicit association test, or IAT. The test was implemented in the late 1990s to try to

gauge implicit attitudes, identities, beliefs, and biases that people are unwilling or unable to report. You can take the IAT online and measure your implicit attitudes in all kinds of topics, from race, religion, and gender to disability, weight, and sexuality. It's basically a timed categorization task. For example, the age-related IAT looks at implicit attitudes about older vs. younger people. In it, you might be shown a series of faces, old and young, and objects, pleasant and unpleasant, like pretty flowers vs. a pile of garbage. You're then asked to sort these pictures, so you'd press the left key if you see a young face or a pleasant object, and press the right key if you see an old face or an unpleasant

object. That's the stereotypic condition. Your keystrokes correspond to stereotypical pairs; in this case, associating good stuff with youth and bad stuff with older age. Then the test asks you to do the same thing in a counter-stereotypic condition, pressing the left key if you see a young face or an unpleasant object and the right key if you see an old face or a pleasant object. The core of the test is your reaction time. Are you faster at sorting when you're working with a stereotypical pairing than you are with counter-stereotypical pairings? If that's the case, even though you may think you're unprejudiced, you've got an implicit association between youth and goodness, which, as you might guess, may have some implications about how you think and act toward older people.

The test is widely used in research, and contrary to what some critics think, it's surprisingly predictive of discriminatory behavior in all kinds of experimental settings. So that's one way to measure subtle, implicit prejudice. But obviously, overt prejudice is far from dead. That's why discrimination studies are prominent in social psychology research, and they can also predict, sometimes with scary accuracy, how discrimination might show up in broad social patterns, like wage inequality and job opportunity gaps. For instance, the 2012 Yale study led by social scientist Corinne Moss-Racusin demonstrated that science faculty across the country systematically discriminated against female science students.

In a double-blind study, a representative sample of science faculty members were asked to hire a fictional student applicant for a lab-manager job. When the applicant's name was Jennifer, instead of John, they viewed her as less competent, were less likely to hire her, offered her less money, and were less likely to mentor her. And this prejudice was even exhibited by women faculty members. And that's an important point. People on both sides of the stereotype tend to respond similarly, with the subjects of prejudice themselves often holding the same stereotypical implicit attitudes or engaging in the same discriminatory behavior. So when we say that stereotypes are pervasive, we mean pervasive.

Now it's all too easy to hold up examples of how people are prejudiced, but the real root of the issue is why they are. Here are a few possibilities: For one, prejudices can come up as a way of justifying social inequalities. This happens when people on both sides of the power and wealth spectrum start believing that people get what they deserve, and they deserve what they get. This is called the just-world phenomenon. Prejudices can also be driven by the "us vs. them," or as social psychologists often call it, the ingroup-outgroup phenomenon. Whether you're in a soccer stadium, or the political arena or school lunchroom, or, you know, in the comments of this video, dividing the world into in-groups and out-groups definitely drives prejudice and discrimination.

But an in-group identity also gives its members the benefits of communal solidarity and a sort of safety in numbers. This in-group bias, or tendency to favor your own group at the expense of others, is powerful, even when it's totally irrational. One common social psychology exercise on in-group favoritism involves dividing a class into two arbitrary groups, say, those wearing sneakers and those not wearing sneakers. Each person sits with his or her group and is told to list differences between themselves and the opposing group. The lists usually start out pretty tame, but become more strident as they grow longer. Eventually, you have sneaker-wearing kids saying that they're just smarter than the people without

sneakers. The kids who don't have sneakers say that the other kids are trashy and low-class. Soon enough, each group has inflated itself and derided the opposing group, even though the division between the two was essentially meaningless to begin with. Little exercises like this illustrate the power of any ingroup-outgroup distinction in creating conflict between groups, and that brings us to the psychological nature of conflict itself. History is littered with examples of how the us vs. them mentality has fueled violence in warfare, which is exactly what we'll be talking about next time. Today, you learned about how prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination affect how we interact and relate to one another. You learned how prejudice can often be non-conscious and automatic

and how tools like the Implicit Association Test help reveal and measure it. We also looked at the implications of the ingroup-outgroup phenomenon, and how it can lead to strong in-group bias that often turns aggressive.

- [00:30] as he stood on the steps of his own apartment building.
- [00:32] Diallo's story, and the officer's fatal pre-judgment of him, is recounted in Malcolm Gladwell's
- [00:37] 2005 bestseller Blink. Gladwell, and the social psychologists whose
- [00:41] work he draws upon, explores Diallo's case as an example of that grey area between deliberate
- [00:47] violence and an accident, propagated by non-conscious, or implicit biases.
- [00:51] The officers did discriminate against Diallo, but the prejudice they acted on may have been
- [00:55] driven by something more subtle than simple hatred.
- [00:58] And that's an important thing to think about. Yes, there are lots of overtly bigoted people
- [01:02] and policies at work all over the world, but what we're interested in today is the more
- [01:07] insidious, non-conscious automatic bias, and how it can affect our behavior.
- [01:12] The fact is, our implicit biases affect the way we relate to others in a very real way.
- [01:17] Our race, gender, age, religion, or sexual orientation can make the difference between
- [01:22] whether we get a job or not, a fair paycheck, or a good rental, or whether we get randomly
- [01:26] pulled over or shot and killed for reaching for a wallet.
- [01:29] In the last two episodes, we've examined how we think about and how we influence one another,
- [01:34] but social psychology is also about how we relate to one another.
- [01:37] Like what factors might cause us to help another person, or harm them, or fear them? What are
- [01:41] the social, and cognitive, and emotional roots of prejudice, racism, and sexism, and how
- [01:45] do they shape our society? These are some of the aspects of ourselves that are the hardest
- [01:48] and most uncomfortable for us to explore, which is why they're so important to understand.
- [02:03] We've all been unfairly judged in our time, and let's not pretend that we haven't done
- [02:07] our fair share of uninformed judging too.
- [02:10] Like it or not, prejudice is a common human condition.
- [02:13] Prejudice just means "prejudgment." It's an unjustified, typically negative attitude toward
- [02:18] an individual or group. Prejudicial attitudes are often directed along
- [02:21] the lines of gender, ethnic, socioeconomic status, or culture, and by definition, prejudice
- [02:26] is not the same thing as stereotyping or discrimination, although the three phenomena are intimately related.
- [02:31] People may distrust a female mechanic. That's a prejudicial attitude, but it's rooted in
- [02:36] a stereotype, or over-generalized belief about a particular group.
- [02:40] Although it's often discussed in a negative way, stereotyping is really more of a general
- [02:44] cognitive process that doesn't have to be negative. It can even be accurate at times.
- [02:49] Like, I have the stereotype that all crows have wings, injuries and birth defects aside.
- [02:54] And that happens to be true.
- [02:56] But on the negative end, your prejudice against female mechanics may be rooted in some inaccurate
- [03:00] stereotype about women's skills with a socket wrench.
- [03:03] And when stereotypical beliefs combine with prejudicial attitudes and emotions, like fear
- [03:07] and hostility, they can drive the behavior we call discrimination.
- [03:11] So a prejudiced person won't necessarily act on their attitude. Say you believe in the
- [03:16] stereotype that overweight people are lazy. You might then feel a prejudiced distaste
- [03:21] when you see someone who appears overweight.
- [03:22] But if you act on your prejudice, and, say, refuse to hire them for a job or don't let
- [03:26] them sit at your lunch counter, then you've crossed over into discriminating against them.
- [03:30] The former apartheid system of racial segregation in South Africa, the Nazis' mass killing of
- [03:34] Gypsies, Jewish people, and other groups, and centuries of bloodshed between Protestants
- [03:38] and Catholics, are all extreme examples of violent prejudice and discrimination.
- [03:43] The good news is that in many cultures, certain forms of overt prejudice have waned over time.
- [03:48] For example, in 1937 only 1/3 of Americans said that they'd vote for a qualified woman to
- [03:52] be president, while in 2007, that figure was up to nearly 90 percent.
- [03:57] But of course more subtle prejudices can still linger.
- [03:59] In the past, we've talked about dual-process theories of thought, memories, and attitudes,
- [04:03] and that while we're aware of our explicit thoughts, or implicit cognition still operates
- [04:08] under the radar, leaving us clueless about its effect on our attitudes and behavior.
- [04:13] In the same way, prejudice can be non-conscious and automatic. And I mean it can be so non-conscious
- [04:18] that even when people ask us point-blank about our attitudes, we unwillingly or unknowingly
- [04:23] don't always give them an honest answer.
- [04:25] Do you think that men are better at science the women? Or that Muslims are more violent
- [04:28] than Christians? Or that overweight people are unhealthy?
- [04:31] Our tendency to unwittingly doctor our answers to questions like these is why we have the
- [04:36] implicit association test, or IAT. The test was implemented in the late 1990s to try to
- [04:41] gauge implicit attitudes, identities, beliefs, and biases that people are unwilling or unable to report.
- [04:48] You can take the IAT online and measure your implicit attitudes in all kinds of topics,
- [04:52] from race, religion, and gender to disability, weight, and sexuality. It's basically a timed categorization task.
- [04:58] For example, the age-related IAT looks at implicit attitudes about older vs. younger
- [05:02] people. In it, you might be shown a series of faces, old and young, and objects, pleasant
- [05:07] and unpleasant, like pretty flowers vs. a pile of garbage.
- [05:10] You're then asked to sort these pictures, so you'd press the left key if you see a young
- [05:14] face or a pleasant object, and press the right key if you see an old face or an unpleasant
- [05:18] object. That's the stereotypic condition. Your keystrokes correspond to stereotypical
- [05:22] pairs; in this case, associating good stuff with youth and bad stuff with older age.
- [05:27] Then the test asks you to do the same thing in a counter-stereotypic condition, pressing
- [05:31] the left key if you see a young face or an unpleasant object and the right key if you
- [05:35] see an old face or a pleasant object.
- [05:38] The core of the test is your reaction time. Are you faster at sorting when you're working
- [05:42] with a stereotypical pairing than you are with counter-stereotypical pairings? If that's
- [05:46] the case, even though you may think you're unprejudiced, you've got an implicit association
- [05:50] between youth and goodness, which, as you might guess, may have some implications about
- [05:54] how you think and act toward older people.
- [05:56] The test is widely used in research, and contrary to what some critics think, it's surprisingly
- [06:00] predictive of discriminatory behavior in all kinds of experimental settings.
- [06:04] So that's one way to measure subtle, implicit prejudice. But obviously, overt prejudice
- [06:09] is far from dead. That's why discrimination studies are prominent in social psychology
- [06:14] research, and they can also predict, sometimes with scary accuracy, how discrimination might
- [06:18] show up in broad social patterns, like wage inequality and job opportunity gaps.
- [06:23] For instance, the 2012 Yale study led by social scientist Corinne Moss-Racusin demonstrated
- [06:28] that science faculty across the country systematically discriminated against female science students.
- [06:33] In a double-blind study, a representative sample of science faculty members were asked
- [06:37] to hire a fictional student applicant for a lab-manager job.
- [06:41] When the applicant's name was Jennifer, instead of John, they viewed her as less competent,
- [06:45] were less likely to hire her, offered her less money, and were less likely to mentor her.
- [06:50] And this prejudice was even exhibited by women faculty members.
- [06:52] And that's an important point. People on both sides of the stereotype tend to respond similarly,
- [06:57] with the subjects of prejudice themselves often holding the same stereotypical implicit
- [07:01] attitudes or engaging in the same discriminatory behavior.
- [07:04] So when we say that stereotypes are pervasive, we mean pervasive.
- [07:08] Now it's all too easy to hold up examples of how people are prejudiced, but the real
- [07:12] root of the issue is why they are.
- [07:14] Here are a few possibilities:
- [07:16] For one, prejudices can come up as a way of justifying social inequalities. This happens
- [07:20] when people on both sides of the power and wealth spectrum start believing that people
- [07:24] get what they deserve, and they deserve what they get. This is called the just-world phenomenon.
- [07:30] Prejudices can also be driven by the "us vs. them," or as social psychologists often call
- [07:34] it, the ingroup-outgroup phenomenon. Whether you're in a soccer stadium, or the political
- [07:38] arena or school lunchroom, or, you know, in the comments of this video, dividing the world
- [07:43] into in-groups and out-groups definitely drives prejudice and discrimination.
- [07:47] But an in-group identity also gives its members the benefits of communal solidarity and a
- [07:51] sort of safety in numbers. This in-group bias, or tendency to favor your own group at the
- [07:56] expense of others, is powerful, even when it's totally irrational. One common social
- [08:01] psychology exercise on in-group favoritism involves dividing a class into two arbitrary
- [08:05] groups, say, those wearing sneakers and those not wearing sneakers. Each person sits with
- [08:09] his or her group and is told to list differences between themselves and the opposing group.
- [08:13] The lists usually start out pretty tame, but become more strident as they grow longer. Eventually,
- [08:19] you have sneaker-wearing kids saying that they're just smarter than the people without
- [08:23] sneakers. The kids who don't have sneakers say that the other kids are trashy and low-class.
- [08:26] Soon enough, each group has inflated itself and derided the opposing group, even though
- [08:30] the division between the two was essentially meaningless to begin with.
- [08:34] Little exercises like this illustrate the power of any ingroup-outgroup distinction
- [08:38] in creating conflict between groups, and that brings us to the psychological nature of conflict itself.
- [08:43] History is littered with examples of how the us vs. them mentality has fueled violence
- [08:48] in warfare, which is exactly what we'll be talking about next time.
- [08:52] Today, you learned about how prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination affect how we interact
- [08:56] and relate to one another. You learned how prejudice can often be non-conscious and automatic
- [09:01] and how tools like the Implicit Association Test help reveal and measure it. We also looked
- [09:05] at the implications of the ingroup-outgroup phenomenon, and how it can lead to strong
- [09:10] in-group bias that often turns aggressive.

### Transcript (reading)

Way back in 1887, a journalist named Elizabeth Cochran assumed the alias Nellie Bly and feigned a mental illness to report on the truly awful conditions inside psychiatric hospitals in the US, which were known as asylums at the time. She found rotten food, cold showers, prevalent rats, abusive nurses, and patients being tied down in her famous expose "Ten Days in a Mad House". What she documented had been pretty standard mental health treatment for centuries, but her work led the charge in mental health reform. It's been a long battle. Nearly a century later in 1975, American psychologist David Rosenhan published a paper called "On Being Sane in Insane Places" detailing the experiment that he conducted on psychiatric

institutions themselves. The first part of his experiment involved sending pseudopatients - a group of eight totally mentally sound associates, including David himself - to knock on institution doors and falsely report that they'd been hearing voices. Once admitted, the fake patients abandoned their fake symptoms and behaved as they normally did, waiting for administrators to recognize them as mentally healthy. Like Cochran, Rosenhan and his team learned that it's easy to get into a mental institution, but it is much, much harder to get out. The participants were kept in the institution for an average of 19 days, one of them for 52 days. They were forced to take psychotropic medication (which they sneakily spit out) and were eventually discharged with a diagnosis

of paranoid schizophrenia in remission. Of course, being dubbed in remission isn't exactly the same thing as being labeled sane, and that was just one of Rosenhan's criticisms of the system. It viewed mental illness as an irreversible condition, almost like a personality trait, rather than a curable illness. Part two of his experiment came later when Rosenhan shared his results with a teaching hospital and then told the staff that he'd be sending more pseudopatients their way in the next few months, and challenged them to detect the imposters. With that in mind, out of 193 new patients, 41 were ferreted out as likely or suspected pseudopatients. The thing is, Rosenhan never actually sent in any pseudopatients. In the end Rosenhan concluded

that the way people were being diagnosed with psychiatric issues often revealed less about the patients themselves and more about their situation. Like, saying you've heard voices one time might catch a doctors attention a lot more than weeks of normal behavior. Naturally people criticized his methods and his findings, but his experiment raised a lot of important questions like: How do we define, diagnose, and classify mental disorders? At what point does sad become depressed? Or quirky become obsessive compulsive? Or energetic become hyperactive? What are the risks and benefits of diagnostic labeling, and how does the field keep evolving? When people think of psychology they probably most often think about the conditions that

it's been designed to understand, diagnose, and treat - namely psychological disorders. From common problems that most of us will experience at some point in our lives to the more serious dysfunctions that require intensive care. They're a big part of what psychology is here for and over the next several lessons we're going to be looking at mental illness, as well as wellness. How symptoms are diagnosed and what biological and environmental causes may be at work. But, to grasp those ideas, we first have to find out how we came to understand the idea of mental health itself and build a science around studying, discussing, and caring for it. In 2010, the World Health Organization reported that about 450 million people worldwide suffer

from some kind of mental or behavioral disorder. No society is immune from them, but when I say psychological disorder I'm guessing some of you will conjure up all sorts of dramatic images like diabolical criminals from Arkham Asylum or Hollywood stereotypes of various eccentric, scary, or tragic figures. This roll call of one-sided stock images is part of the problem our culture faces - the misconceptions and often destructive stigma associated with psychological disorders. So, what does that term actually mean? Mental health clinicians think of psychological disorders as deviant, distressful, and dysfunctional patterns of thoughts, feelings, or behaviors. And yeah, there are a lot of sensitive and loaded words in there, so let's talk about what we mean, starting with deviant.

Sounds like I'm talking about doing things that are dicey or raunchy, but in this context it's used to describe thoughts and behavior that are different from most of the rest of your cultural context. Of course, being different is usually wonderful. Geniuses and Olympians and visionaries are all deviants from the norm so it probably goes without saying that the standards for so-called deviant behavior change a lot across cultures and in different situations. For example, in a combat situation killing people is probably to be expected, but murder is definitely deviant criminal behavior back home in times of peace. And in some contexts speaking to spirits or ancestors is A-OK, but in other settings say a bar in Iowa City at happy hour it might not be quite acceptable.

But, to be classified as a disorder, that deviant behavior needs to cause that person or others around them distress, which just means a subjective feeling that something is really wrong. In turn, distress can lead to truly harmful dysfunction - when a person's ability to work and live is clearly, often measurably, impaired. So that's today's definition but it took a long time for the Western world to come up with a way of thinking about psychological disorders that was rooted in science and investigative inquiry. It wasn't until around the 18th and 19th centuries that we really started to put forth the notion that mental health issues might be about a sickness in the mind. For example, by the 1800s doctors finally caught on to the fact that advanced syphilis could

manifest in serious neurological problems like dementia, and irritability, and various mental disorders. So eventually a lot of so-called mental patients were removed from asylums to full medical hospitals where all of their symptoms could be treated. This "a-ha" moment is just one instance of how perspectives on mental health began to shift towards what is called the Medical Model of Psychological Disorder. The Medical Model champions the notion that psychological disorders have physiological causes that can be diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, and treated, and sometimes even cured. That way of thinking about mental health was an important step forward, at least at first. It took us past the old days of simply locking people up when they didn't seem quite right to others.

But even if it was an improvement, the medical model was seen by some in the field as kind of narrow and outdated. Most contemporary psychologists prefer to view mental health more comprehensively through what is called the Biopsychological Approach. You've heard us say over and over again that everything psychological is simultaneously biological and that truism is particularly useful here. The Biopsychological view takes that holistic perspective, accounting for a whole number of things clearly physiological and not in order to understand what's happening to us, what might be going wrong, and how it can be treated. It takes into account psychological influences for sure like stress and trauma and memories,

but also biological factors like genetics and brain chemistry, and social-cultural influences like all the expectations wrapped up in how a culture defines normal behavior. So by considering the whole host of nature and nurture influences, we can take a broader view of mental health, realizing that some disorders can be cured while others can be coped with, and still others may end up not being disorders at all once our culture accepts them. But another important part of handling disorders with scientific rigor is attempting to standardize and measure them. How we talk about them, how we diagnose them, and how we treat them. So the field has literally come up with a manual that shows you how to do that. But

it is not without it's flaws. It's called the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; or, DSM-5 because it's currently in its fifth edition. And it is used by practically everybody: clinicians obviously, but also by insurance and drug companies, and policy makers, and the whole legal system. The first edition came out in 1952, and this newest version was released in 2013. What's particularly interesting about it is that it's designed to be a work in progress... forever. Each new edition incorporates changes based on the latest research but also how our understanding of mental health and behavior evolves over time. For example, believe it or not the first two editions actually classified homosexuality as a pathology, basically a

disease. The 1973 third edition eliminated that designation, reflecting changing attitudes and a developing understanding of sexual orientation. And just by looking at the changes between the edition used today and the previous version released in the year 2000, you can get a picture not only of how quickly things change but also how classification can affect diagnosis - for better or worse - and also what the risks are of classifying psychological disorders in the first place. For instance, the new edition reflects our growing understanding of the symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and it changed the name of Childhood Bipolar Disorder to Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder because kids were being over-diagnosed and over-treated

for bipolar disorder when the condition that they had didn't actually fit that description. And totally new diagnoses are being explored as well, like Gambling Addiction and what's called Internet Gaming Disorder, showing that new disorders continue to arise with changing times. But the DSM is not perfect, even though we've come a long way since the Rosenhan experiment, critics still worry about how the DSM might inadvertently promote the over- or mis-diagnosis and treatment of certain behaviors. Others echo Rosenhan's concerns that by slapping patients with labels we're making them vulnerable to judgments and preconceptions that'll affect how others will perceive and treat them.

In the end, it's just important to keep in mind that definitions are powerful and things can get tricky pretty fast in the world of mental health. Today you learned about how we define psychological disorders, and looked at medical and biopsychological perspectives on mental illness. We talked about how professionals use the DSM to diagnose disorders and how it's constantly evolving to incorporate new thinking.

- [05:11] So that's today's definition but it took a long time for the Western world to come up
- [05:15] with a way of thinking about psychological disorders that was rooted in science and investigative
- [05:20] inquiry. It wasn't until around the 18th and 19th centuries that we really started to put
- [05:24] forth the notion that mental health issues might be about a sickness in the mind. For
- [05:28] example, by the 1800s doctors finally caught on to the fact that advanced syphilis could
- [05:32] manifest in serious neurological problems like dementia, and irritability, and various
- [05:37] mental disorders. So eventually a lot of so-called mental patients were removed from asylums
- [05:42] to full medical hospitals where all of their symptoms could be treated.
- [05:46] This "a-ha" moment is just one instance of how perspectives on mental health began to
- [05:51] shift towards what is called the Medical Model of Psychological Disorder. The Medical Model
- [05:56] champions the notion that psychological disorders have physiological causes that can be diagnosed
- [06:01] on the basis of symptoms, and treated, and sometimes even cured. That way of thinking
- [06:05] about mental health was an important step forward, at least at first. It took us past
- [06:09] the old days of simply locking people up when they didn't seem quite right to others.
- [06:13] But even if it was an improvement, the medical model was seen by some in the field as kind
- [06:16] of narrow and outdated. Most contemporary psychologists prefer to view mental health
- [06:20] more comprehensively through what is called the Biopsychological Approach. You've heard
- [06:24] us say over and over again that everything psychological is simultaneously biological
- [06:28] and that truism is particularly useful here. The Biopsychological view takes that holistic
- [06:34] perspective, accounting for a whole number of things clearly physiological and not in
- [06:39] order to understand what's happening to us, what might be going wrong, and how it can
- [06:42] be treated.
- [06:43] It takes into account psychological influences for sure like stress and trauma and memories,
- [06:48] but also biological factors like genetics and brain chemistry, and social-cultural influences
- [06:53] like all the expectations wrapped up in how a culture defines normal behavior. So by considering
- [06:57] the whole host of nature and nurture influences, we can take a broader view of mental health,
- [07:02] realizing that some disorders can be cured while others can be coped with, and still
- [07:06] others may end up not being disorders at all once our culture accepts them.
- [07:10] But another important part of handling disorders with scientific rigor is attempting to standardize
- [07:14] and measure them. How we talk about them, how we diagnose them, and how we treat them.
- [07:19] So the field has literally come up with a manual that shows you how to do that. But
- [07:24] it is not without it's flaws. It's called the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic
- [07:28] and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; or, DSM-5 because it's currently in its fifth
- [07:34] edition. And it is used by practically everybody: clinicians obviously, but also by insurance
- [07:39] and drug companies, and policy makers, and the whole legal system.
- [07:43] The first edition came out in 1952, and this newest version was released in 2013. What's
- [07:49] particularly interesting about it is that it's designed to be a work in progress...
- [07:53] forever. Each new edition incorporates changes based on the latest research but also how
- [07:58] our understanding of mental health and behavior evolves over time. For example, believe it
- [08:02] or not the first two editions actually classified homosexuality as a pathology, basically a
- [08:07] disease. The 1973 third edition eliminated that designation, reflecting changing attitudes
- [08:12] and a developing understanding of sexual orientation. And just by looking at the changes between
- [08:17] the edition used today and the previous version released in the year 2000, you can get a picture
- [08:22] not only of how quickly things change but also how classification can affect diagnosis
- [08:26] - for better or worse - and also what the risks are of classifying psychological disorders
- [08:31] in the first place.
- [08:32] For instance, the new edition reflects our growing understanding of the symptoms of Post
- [08:35] Traumatic Stress Disorder, and it changed the name of Childhood Bipolar Disorder to
- [08:40] Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder because kids were being over-diagnosed and over-treated
- [08:46] for bipolar disorder when the condition that they had didn't actually fit that description.
- [08:50] And totally new diagnoses are being explored as well, like Gambling Addiction and what's
- [08:54] called Internet Gaming Disorder, showing that new disorders continue to arise with changing times.
- [08:59] But the DSM is not perfect, even though we've come a long way since the Rosenhan experiment,
- [09:03] critics still worry about how the DSM might inadvertently promote the over- or mis-diagnosis
- [09:08] and treatment of certain behaviors. Others echo Rosenhan's concerns that by slapping
- [09:13] patients with labels we're making them vulnerable to judgments and preconceptions that'll affect
- [09:18] how others will perceive and treat them.
- [09:19] In the end, it's just important to keep in mind that definitions are powerful and things
- [09:23] can get tricky pretty fast in the world of mental health.
- [09:26] Today you learned about how we define psychological disorders, and looked at medical and biopsychological
- [09:31] perspectives on mental illness. We talked about how professionals use the DSM to diagnose
- [09:35] disorders and how it's constantly evolving to incorporate new thinking. Thanks for watching,

Ever heard a really good joke about polio? Or made a casual reference to someone having hepatitis? Or maybe teased your buddy by saying he has muscular dystrophy? Of course you have never done that, because you are not a terrible person. You'd never make fun of someone for having a physical illness, but folks make all kinds of offhand remarks about people having mental illnesses and never give it a second thought. How often have you heard a person say that someone's psycho, or schizo, or bipolar, or OCD? I can pretty much guarantee that the people who used those terms had no idea what they actually meant. We've talked about how psychological disorders and the people who have them have often been stigmatized.

But at the same time, we tend to minimize those disorders, using them as nicknames for things that people do, think, or say, that may not exactly be universal, but are still basically healthy. And we all do it, but only because we don't really understand those conditions. But that's why we're here, because as we go deeper into psychological disorders, we get a clearer understanding of their symptoms, types, causes, and the perspectives that help explain them. And some of the most common disorders have their root in an unpleasant mental state that's familiar to us all: anxiety. It's a part of being human, but for some people it can develop into intense fear, and paralyzing dread, and ultimately turn into full-fledged anxiety disorder.

Defining psychological disorders again: a deviant, distressful, and dysfunctional pattern of thoughts, feelings, or behaviors that interferes with the ability to function in a healthy way. So when it comes to anxiety, that definition is the difference between the guy you probably called phobic because he didn't like Space Mountain as much as you did, and the person who truly can't leave their house for fear of interacting with others. It's the difference between the girl who's teased by her friends as being OCD because she does her laundry every night and the girl who has to wash her hands so often that they bleed. Starting today, you're going to understand all of those terms you've been using.

We commonly equate anxiety with fear, but anxiety disorders aren't just a matter of fear itself. A key component is also what we do to get rid of that fear. Say someone almost drowned as a kid and is now afraid of water. A family picnic at the river may cause that anxiety to bubble up, and to cope, they may stay sequestered in the car, less anxious but probably still unhappy while the rest of the family is having fun. So, in clinical terms, anxiety disorders are characterized not only by distressing, persistent anxiety but also often by the dysfunctional behaviors that reduce that anxiety. At least a fifth of all people will experience a diagnosable anxiety disorder of some kind at some point in their lives. That is a lot of us.

So I want to start out with a condition that used to be categorized as an anxiety disorder but is now considered complex enough to be in a class by itself, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder or OCD. You probably know that condition is characterized by unwanted repetitive thoughts, which become obsessions, which are sometimes accompanied by actions, which become compulsions. And it is a great example of a psychological disorder that could use some mental-health myth busting. Being neat, and orderly, and fastidious does not make you OCD. OCD is a debilitating condition whose sufferers take normal behaviors like, washing your hands, or double checking that you turned off the stove and perform them compulsively.

And they often use these compulsive, even ritualistic behaviors to relieve intense and unbearable anxiety. So, soon they're scrubbing their hands every five minutes, or constantly checking the stove, or counting the exact number of steps they take everywhere they go. If you're still unclear about what it means for disorders to be deviant, distressful and dysfunctional, OCD might help you understand. Because it is hard to keep a job, run a household, sit still, or do much of anything if you feel intensely compelled to run to the kitchen twenty times an hour. And both the thoughts and behaviors associated with OCD are often driven by a fear that is itself obsessive, like if you don't go to the kitchen right now your house will burn down and your

child will die which makes the condition that much more distressing and self-reinforcing. There are treatments that help OCD including certain kinds of psychotherapy and some psychotropic drugs. But the key here is that it is not a description for your roommate who cleans her bathroom twice a week, or the guy in the cubicle next to you, who only likes to use green felt tip pens. And even though OCD is considered its own unique set of psychological issues, the pervasive senses of fear, worry, and loss of control that often accompany it, have a lot in common with other anxiety disorders. The broadest of these is Generalized Anxiety Disorder or GAD. People with this condition tend to feel continually tense and apprehensive, experiencing unfocused, negative, and out-of-control feelings.

Of course feeling this way occasionally is common enough, but feeling it consistently for over six months - the length of time required for a formal diagnosis - is not. Folks with GAD worry all the time and are frequently agitated and on edge, but unlike some other kinds of anxiety, patients often can't identify what's causing the anxiousness, so they don't even know what to avoid. Then there's Panic Disorder, which affects about 1 in 75 people, most often teens and young adults. It's calling card is Panic Attacks or sudden episodes of intense dread or sudden fear that come without warning. Unlike the symptoms of GAD which can be hard to pin down, Panic Attacks are brief, well-defined, and sometimes severe bouts of elevated anxiety.

And if you've ever had one, or been with someone who has, you know that they call these attacks for good reason. They can cause chest pains and racing heartbeat, difficulty breathing and a general sense that you're going crazy or even dying. It's as awful as it sounds. We've talked a lot about the body's physiological fight or flight response and that's definitely part of what's going on here, even though there often isn't an obvious trigger. There may be a genetic pre-disposition to panic disorder, but persistent stress or having experienced psychological trauma in the past can also set you up for these attacks. And because the attacks themselves can be downright terrifying, a common trigger for panic disorder is simply the fear of having another panic attack.

How's that for a kick in the head? Say you have a panic attack on a bus, or you find yourself hyperventilating in front of dozens of strangers with nowhere to go to calm yourself down, that whole ordeal might make you never want to be in that situation again, so your anxiety could lead you to start avoiding crowded or confined places. At this point the initial anxiety has spun of into a fear of anxiety which means, welcome you've migrated into another realm of anxiety disorder, Phobias. And again this is a term that's been misused for a long time to describe people who, say, they don't like cats, or are uncomfortable on long plane trips. Simply experiencing fear or discomfort doesn't make you phobic.

In clinical terms, phobias are persistent, irrational fears of specific objects, activities, or situations, that also, and this is important, leads to avoidance behavior. You hear a lot about fears of heights, or spiders, or clowns, and those are real things. They're specific phobias that focus on particular objects or situations. For example, the Chesapeake Bay Bridge in Maryland is a seven-thousand meter span that crosses the Chesapeake Bay, if you want to get to or from Eastern Maryland that's pretty much the only way to do it, at least in a car, but there are thousands of people who are so afraid of crossing that bridge that they simply can't do it. So, to accommodate this avoidance behavior, driver services are available.

For $25 people with Gephyrophobia, a fear of bridges, can hire someone to drive themselves, and their kids, and dogs, and groceries across the bridge in their own car, while trying not to freak out. But other phobias lack such specific triggers, what we might think of as social phobia, currently known as social anxiety disorder, is characterized by anxiety related to interacting or being seen by others, which could be triggered by a phone call, or being called on in class, or just thinking about meeting new people. So you can probably see at this point how anxiety disorders are related and how they can be difficult to tease apart. The same thing can be said about what we think causes them.

Because much in the same way anxiety can show up as both a feeling like panic, and a thought, like is my kitchen on fire, there are also two main perspectives on how we currently view anxiety as a function of both learning and biology. The learning perspective suggests that things like, conditioning, and observational learning and cognition, all of which we've talked about before best explain the source of our anxiety. Remember our behaviorist friend, John B. Watson and his conditioning experiments with poor little Albert, by making a loud scary noise every time you showed the kid a white rat, he ended up conditioning the boy to fear any furry object, from bunnies, to dogs, to fur coats.

That conditioning used two specific learning processes to cement itself in Little Albert's young mind. Stimulus Generalization, expanded or generalized his fear of the rat to other furry objects, the same principle holds true if you were, like, attacked by your neighbours mean parrot and subsequently fear all birds. But then the anxiety is solidified through reinforcement, every time you avoid or escape a feared situations, a pair of fuzzy slippers or a robin on the street, you ease your anxiety, which might make you feel better temporarily, but it actually reinforces your phobic behavior, making it stronger. Cognition also influences our anxiety, whether we interpret a strange noise outside as a hungry bear, or a robber, or merely the wind, determines if we roll-over and keep snoring,

or freak out and run for a kitchen knife. And we might also acquire anxiety from other people through observational learning. A parent who's terrified of water may end up instilling that fear in their child by violently snatching them away from kiddie pools or generally acting anxious around park fountains and duck ponds. But there're also equally important biological perspectives. Natural selection, for instance, might explain why we seem to fear certain potentially dangerous animals, like snakes, or why fears of heights or closed in spaces are relatively common. It's probably true that our more wary ancestors who had the sense to stay away from cliff edges and hissing serpents were more likely to live another day and pass along their genes,

so this might explain why those fears can persist, and why even people who live in places without poisonous snakes would still fear snakes anyway. And then you got the genetics and the brain chemistry to consider. Research has shown for example that identical twins, those eternal test subjects, are more likely to develop phobias even if they're raised apart. Some researchers have detected seventeen different genes that seem to be expressed with various anxiety disorders. So it may be that some folks are just naturally more anxious than others and they might pass on that quality to their kids. And of course individual brains have a lot to say about how they process anxiety.

Physiologically, people who experience panic attacks, generalized anxiety, or obsessive compulsions show over-arousal in the areasof the brain that deal in impulse control and habitual behaviors. Now we don't know whether these irregularities cause the disorder or are caused by it, but again, it reinforces the truism that everything that is psychological is simultaneously biological. And that holds true for many other psychological disorders we'll talk about in the coming weeks, many of which have names that you've also heard being misused in the past. Today you learned what defines an anxiety disorder, as well as the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder and phobias.

You also learned about the two main perspectives on the origins of anxiety disorders, the learning perspective and the biological perspective and hopefully you learned not to use "OCD" as a punch line from now on.

- [08:53] hungry bear, or a robber, or merely the wind, determines if we roll-over and keep snoring,
- [08:58] or freak out and run for a kitchen knife.
- [09:00] And we might also acquire anxiety from other people through observational learning.
- [09:04] A parent who's terrified of water may end up instilling that fear in their child by
- [09:08] violently snatching them away from kiddie pools or generally acting anxious around park
- [09:13] fountains and duck ponds.
- [09:14] But there're also equally important biological perspectives. Natural selection, for instance,
- [09:18] might explain why we seem to fear certain potentially dangerous animals, like snakes, or why fears
- [09:24] of heights or closed in spaces are relatively common.
- [09:27] It's probably true that our more wary ancestors who had the sense to stay away from cliff
- [09:31] edges and hissing serpents were more likely to live another day and pass along their genes,
- [09:36] so this might explain why those fears can persist, and why even people who live in places
- [09:40] without poisonous snakes would still fear snakes anyway.
- [09:43] And then you got the genetics and the brain chemistry to consider.
- [09:46] Research has shown for example that identical twins, those eternal test subjects, are more
- [09:50] likely to develop phobias even if they're raised apart.
- [09:53] Some researchers have detected seventeen different genes that seem to be expressed with various
- [09:58] anxiety disorders.
- [10:00] So it may be that some folks are just naturally more anxious than others and they might pass
- [10:04] on that quality to their kids.
- [10:06] And of course individual brains have a lot to say about how they process anxiety.
- [10:10] Physiologically, people who experience panic attacks, generalized anxiety, or obsessive
- [10:15] compulsions show over-arousal in the areasof the brain that deal in impulse control
- [10:19] and habitual behaviors.
- [10:21] Now we don't know whether these irregularities cause the disorder or are caused by it, but
- [10:25] again, it reinforces the truism that everything that is psychological is simultaneously biological.
- [10:30] And that holds true for many other psychological disorders we'll talk about in the coming weeks,
- [10:35] many of which have names that you've also heard being misused in the past.
- [10:39] Today you learned what defines an anxiety disorder, as well as the symptoms of obsessive
- [10:43] compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder and phobias.
- [10:47] You also learned about the two main perspectives on the origins of anxiety disorders, the learning
- [10:52] perspective and the biological perspective and hopefully you learned not to use "OCD"
- [10:57] as a punch line from now on.

### Transcript (reading)

American psychologist, and professor of psychiatry, Kay Redfield Jamison, is one of the world's foremost authorities on bipolar disorder. She's spent her career researching, lecturing, and writing seminal books on the condition. A condition that she also happens to have had her entire adult life. In her memoir, "An Unquiet Mind," Jamison details what it really means to be bipolar. She writes of not sleeping for days on end, of feeling long periods of euphoria, and filling whole notebooks with her racing thoughts and grandiose ideas. While in these manic states, she experienced a tremendously inflated sense of self-esteem and did impulsive things that felt good at the time but had painful consequences, like

going on lavish shopping sprees, engaging in promiscuous behavior, racking up credit card debt, and emptying her bank accounts. But these episodes were followed by emotional crashes: Crippling bouts of depression that sent her into a suicidal spiral. At the age of 28, Jamison tried to kill herself by taking an overdose of Lithium, lapsed into a coma, but thankfully emerged from it determined to find help through medication and therapy. Through her research and writing, Dr. Jamison has pioneered our understanding of bipolar disorder, depression, and the nexus of mental struggles that we now think of as mood disorders. And she's probably one of the best ambassadors we have for all those people who live successful, productive lives with mental illness.

Just like the anxiety disorders we talked about last time, mood disorders are misunderstood. They're diluted by depictions of depression as something that can be treated with one day at a spa or descriptions of people as manic depressive just because they were sad yesterday and aren't today. As students of psychology, our job is to understand what mood disorders really are, how they manifest themselves, and what might cause them. And as you probably guessed, this can be pretty tough terrain to explore. These disorders can take people from terrifying highs to pits of despair that seem all but bottomless. But! In between there's what Jamison has called, "A rich, imaginative life" -- all made possible by your moods.

We've been talking a lot about terms and concepts that mean something different than what you think they mean, but this time, the term "Mood" is not one of those. In a psychological context, moods are pretty much exactly what you think they are: Emotional states that are even more subjective and harder to define than the emotions themselves. And while psychologists have defined about 10 basic emotions, moods tend to fall into two broadly and infinitely variable categories. You got the good moods and the bad moods. Probably the most important distinction between emotion and mood is that moods are long-term emotional states rather than discreet, fleeting feelings. And "mood-disorders," which are characterized by emotional extremes and challenges in regulating

mood tend to be longer-term disturbances. These include depressive disorders, typified by prolonged hopelessness and lethargy, and bipolar disorders, the most prominent of which involve alternating between depression and mania. Depression has been called the common cold of psychological disorders. Which is not to say that it isn't serious, but it's common and it's pervasive and it's the top reason people seek out mental health help. We've all felt down before, obviously, often in response to a specific loss: a breakup or a lost job or the death of a loved one. And the fact is, you probably should feel bad at times like those. It can actually be good for a mind and body to slow down, to help digest losses that you experience, but

in general, sadness is temporary. It's when sadness and grief extend beyond the generally accepted social norms, or plunge into a depth that causes serious dysfunction that you find yourself in the territory of depressive disorders. The DSM-5, our handy (if super flawed) user's guide to psychological disorders officially diagnoses a major depressive disorder when a patient has experienced at least five signs of depression for more than two weeks. These symptoms include not just depressed mood, but also significant weight or appetite loss or gain, too much or too little sleep, decreased interest in activities, feeling worthless, fatigued, or lethargic, difficulty concentrating or making decisions, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide.

So while everyone experiences sadness, depression is a physiological as well as psychological illness. It messes with your sleep, and appetite, and energy, and neurotransmitter levels, all interfering with the way your body runs itself. Plus in keeping with our definition of psychological disorders, to be considered a true disorder this behavior needs to cause the person or others around them prolonged distress - the feeling that something is really wrong. Just as a person with a severe, generalized anxiety disorder may never want to leave the house, a clinically depressed person often feels so hopeless and overwhelmed that they have trouble living a normal life. And unlike the bipolar disorders, the depressive disorders tend to be all lows.

You've probably heard of manic depression. It's the outdated term for bipolar disorders. These include those classic dark lows of depression, but also bouts of the opposite - of extreme mania in more severe cases. Someone suffering from a bipolar disorder may flip back and forth between normal and depressive and manic phases within a single day or week or month. And a true manic episode doesn't just mean being energetic or happy, it's a period of intense, restless, but often optimistic hyperactivity in which your estimation of yourself and your abilities and your ideas can often get skewed. Like, really, REALLY skewed. Some patients experience mania only rarely, but when they do, it can be destructive. Kay Jamison has testified to that.

Once during a manic episode, she bought up a drug store's entire supply of snake-bite kits, convinced of an imminent attack of rattlesnakes that only she knew was coming. In another, she purchased 20 books by the Penguin Publishing House because she said, "It could be nice if the penguins could form a colony." In other words, bad judgment is common. And it can get worse. Full blown manic episodes often end up in psychiatric hospitalization, since the risk to self or others can become severe. When the highs eventually end, they're often followed by dark periods of depression. When left untreated, suicide or suicide attempts are common, another element of the disorder that Jamison herself can attest to.

Like so many things in psychology, the cause of mood disorders is often a combination of biological, genetic, psychological, and environmental factors. We know, for example, that mood disorders run in families - genes matter. And you're more likely to experience a bipolar or depressive disorder if you have parents or siblings who suffer from them. Studies have of identical twins show that if one twin has a bipolar disorder, that the other has a seven in ten chance of also being diagnosed, regardless of whether they were raised together or apart. And while a stressful life can't give you bipolar disorder, it could trigger a manic or depressive episode in someone with a pre-existing condition. Or start a descent into a major

depressive episode in someone who never before had experienced depression. In other words, a person who loses a loved one could go from sad to depressed or slide into a bipolar episode, but it couldn't cause them to have the disorder to begin with. In the case of depressive disorders, for most people, after weeks, months, or even years, their depression can end, hopefully with the return to baseline healthy functioning. World-wide, women tend to be diagnosed with major depression more often than men, but many psychologists think this is simply because women tend to seek treatment more. It's also possible that depression in men tends to manifest itself more in terms of anger and aggression, than as sadness and hopelessness.

This is just an example of how depression is much more than just being sad and that the characteristic lack of purpose and helplessness can manifest itself in a lot of different ways. Looking at mood disorders from a neurological perspective, we see that depressed, manic, and average brains show very different brain activity in neural imaging scans. As you might expect, a brain in a depressed state slows down. While a brain in a manic state shows a lot of increased activity, making it hard for that person to calm down or focus or sleep. Our brain's neurotransmitter chemistry also changes with these different states. For example, norepinephrine, which usually increases arousal and focus, is severely lacking in depressed

brains, but kind of off the charts during manic episodes. In fact, drugs that seek to reduce mania in part do it by reducing norepinephrine levels. You may have also heard about how low serotonin levels correlate with depressive states. Exercise, like jogging or break dancing or whatever, increases serotonin levels, which is one reason exercise is often recommended to combat depression. And most medications designed to treat depression seem to work by raising serotonin or norepinephrine levels. And of course there's yet another way to look at things. The social-cognitive perspective examines how our thinking and behavior influence depression. People with depression often view bad events through an internal lens or mind set that

influences how they're interpreted. And how you explain events to yourself, in a negative or positive way, can really effect how you recover from them - or don't. Say you were humiliated in the lunch room when someone tripped you and chicken soup flew all over the place, and you sat down on a brownie, and it was just a bad day. A depressive mind might immediately start thinking that the humiliation will last forever, that no one will ever let you live it down, that it's somehow your own fault, and you can't ever do anything right. That negative thinking, learned helplessness, self-blame, and over-thinking can feed off itself and basically smother the joy out of the brain, eventually creating a vicious self-fulfilling cycle of negative thinking.

The good news is that the cycle can be broken by getting help from a professional, turning your attention outward, doing more fun things, and maybe even moving to a different environment. But again, that social-cognitive prospective is just part of a much bigger puzzle. Positive thinking is important, but it's often inadequate on its own own when up against genetic or neurological factors. So mood disorders are complicated conditions and rarely are they eliminated with a single cure. Instead, they're often things you just live with. And as Dr. Jamison has shown us, you can live well. Today we talked about what mood disorders are, as well as what they aren't. You learned about the symptoms of depressive and bipolar disorders, and the possible biological, genetic,

environmental, and social-cognitive causes of mood disorders. Thank you for watching this episode, which was brought to you by Marshall Scott and crediblefind.com.

### Transcript (reading)

All right, so you might have read "The Hobbit" or "The Lord of the Rings," you have probably seen them, you've definitely heard of them. But not everyone knows the story of their author, J.R.R. Tolkien. Tolkien was an English World War One veteran. A reluctant solider, he joined up with a sense of duty and he lived through the bloody battle of Somme suffering tremendous shock, guilt, and loss during and after the war. It took Tolkien years to processes his experiences. To help him do it he turned to writing fiction and in time he constructed a world that helped him and all of us better understand war, human nature, loss, and growth. His novels were the bi-product of trauma and they're among the more beautiful reminders of how it can affect us.

Most of us will experience some kind of traumatic event in our lives and most of us will exhibit some kind of stress related behavior because of it, these symptoms usually fade but for some those reactions can linger and start of disrupt their lives or the lives of those around them. These reactions can develop into full blown psychological disorders including post-traumatic stress disorder and, in an effort to cope, sometimes addiction, but it doesn't always have to be that way. Ultimately, Tolkien was able to harness the effect of his trauma and shape them into something important and to reclaim is own life because there is such a thing as post-traumatic growth, too. As it does with many other things psychology approaches trauma related disorders with different

perspectives, but they all tend to ask the same questions. How do you identify and diagnose these disorders? And how do you treat them, so that the patients can recover? -- With the understanding that they might never be the same as they were before the trauma, but they can still be healthy and happy. In a way, psychology helps patients ask themselves, what Tolkien asks his readers, and what Frodo asks when he is finally safe back in the shire: "How do you pick up the threads of an old life? How to go on, when in your heart, you begin to understand that there is no going back." It could be September 11 or a serious car accident or a natural disaster or a violent crime that you survived but are still haunted by. Trauma comes in many different forms and sometimes it can stick with you.

When it manifests as nightmares, flashbacks, avoidance, fear, guilt, anxiety, rage, insomnia, and begins to interfere with your ability to function it can come to be known as post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD. It was once call "shell shock" a term used to describe the condition of veterans, like Tolkien in World War One but PTSD isn't limited to veterans. It's defined as a psychological disorder generated by either witnessing or experiencing a traumatic event. Its symptoms are classified into four major clusters in the DSM V. One of these clusters involves re-living the event through intrusive memories, nightmares, or flashbacks. The second involves avoiding situations you associate with the event, while

the third generally describes excessive physiological arousal like heart pounding, muscle tension, anxiety or irritability, and major problems sleeping or concentrating. And finally we have the fourth major symptom cluster: pervasive negative changes in emotions and belief, like feelings in excessive guilt, fear, or shame -- or no longer getting enjoyment out of what you used to. PTSD patients may also experience numbing, or periods of feeling emotionless or emotionally "flat" and dissociation, feeling as if situations aren't real or are surreal, feeling like time has slowed down or sped up, or even blacking out. We have been discussing how anxiety or mood disorders can affect a person's ability to function and how that impairment itself leads to more suffering and dysfunction.

When any of these disorders is left untreated suffers may start to feel desperate to find some way to cope and one way may be substance abuse. Unfortunately, addiction and trauma can go hand in hand and it can be hard to recover from one without also dealing with the other. According to the US department of Veteran's Affairs more than 2 in 10 veterans with PTSD also struggle with substance abuse problems and 1 in every 3 vets seeking treatment for substance abuse also have PTSD. And across many studies, between a third to a half of women in treatment for substance abuse have experienced rape or sexual assault. For a long time most psychologists understood PTSD through the lens of fear conditioning or the unshakable memory of being in mortal danger and the learned responses that stem

from that memory. But clinicians have also begun to recognize that for some the disorder can also be a kind of moral injury, widening the focus to include hauntings not just of violence done to a person but also what that person did or did not do to others. Brandon was a combat drone operator in the air force he enlisted at 21 years old and spent 6 years sitting in a bunker in the American South-West watching Iraq and Afghanistan from surveillance drones. He watched soldiers die and people get executed. He also watched kids play, people get married, goats grazing -- and when the time came he ordered hell fire missiles to strike military targets or people who had no idea they where even being watched.

Although he was half a world away from combat, he ultimately suffered the psychological trauma felt by many on the ground soldiers. He was diagnosed with PTSD. Brandon suffers no fears for his own safety, but still experiences the same intrusive memories, nightmares, depression, anxiety, and substance abuse of many emotionally traumatized combat soldiers. So do a lot of other drone operators. But why do some victims or trauma suffer from PTSD while others seem able to move on? Well, its psychology so the risk factors are complicated. Some findings suggest that there may be genetic predispositions making some people more vulnerable than others. We also know that context and environment matter, for instance, someone who has experienced

childhood abuse might feel on the one hand more ready to deal with difficult and traumatic experiences. But on the other hand they might be more likely to default to the suppression and avoidance in which PTSD suffers frequently engage, which as we've discussed in previous episodes often makes psychiatric symptoms worsen over time. As far as whats going on in the brain, PTSD shares some similarities with anxiety disorders. For example the brains limbic system may flood the body with waves of stress hormones like cortisol every time images of the traumatic event bubble up uninvited into consciousness. And we've already talked a lot about how the amygdala and hippocampus are involved in those classic fight or flight reactions, which when prolonged can be really rough on the body.

In fact, neuroimaging suggests that trauma -- or the chemical processes set into motion by trauma -- might actually damage and shrink the hippocampus. Since this region is also associated with how we consolidate memories, this might explain how memories associated with trauma could fail to be filed away as long-term memories and instead remain vivid and fresh through flashbacks and nightmares. If there's any silver lining to all of this, it's that some people may actually experience positive change after a trauma. Treatment and social support help some suffers achieve post-traumatic growth, positive psychological changes resulting from the struggle with challenging circumstances and life crises.

That's in part what Tolkien did. Though he suffered great trauma and loss on the battlefield, he was eventually able to use those experiences to drive those powerful, allegorical stories. Stories that helped not just himself, but many readers of all ages around the world. It seems that while whatever doesn't kill you might not necessarily make you stronger, sometimes it really does. But suffering can feed on itself. Many victims of trauma try to cope through whats colloquially called self-medicating and some can end up with substance abuse or dependence issues. Psychologists define addiction or dependence as compulsive, excessive, and difficult-to-control substance use, or other, initially pleasurable behavior that beings to interfere with ordinary life, work, health, or relationships.

This could mean over-consuming drugs or alcohol, or compulsively gambling, eating, shopping, exercising, or having sex. People with addictions may not even realize that they have lost control of their behavior for some time. Addiction can refer to a physical dependence, a physiological need for a drug, that reveals itself through terrible withdrawal symptoms if the use stops or reduces. Or psychological dependence, the need to use that drug, or complete that activity in order to relieve negative emotions. People with addiction can sometimes be stigmatized as pleasure-bound hedonists who have no self-control, but people often compulsively use substances or do things in reaction to stress and other psychological problems. For various reasons they have been prevented from coping in other

ways or maybe they just never learned how. So in this way addiction itself is often secondary to the more complicated matter of how a person deals with stress and difficult emotions, or what kinds of stressful situations they've survived. Few will dispute that much of what makes addiction possible is chemistry, but people are different -- from their life experiences to their biological sensitivities. So people respond in different way to different drugs and behaviors. Many people can drink casually or gamble once in a while without losing control. Others simply can't. People in recovery from addiction may also have different needs. Some will need to be completely sober and never again touch that drug or do that thing. While others may in

time be able to regain enough control to use again in moderation. Likewise, some folks can kick the habit on their own while others do better with or need support from professionals or support groups. Researchers and groups like Alcoholics Anonymous debate whether addiction is a mental illness -- like a "software problem" related to thoughts, and behaviors, and feelings -- or a physical disease -- a "hard wire problem" related to biology and genetics -- or both, and even whether addiction and dependence are the same thing. Either way it can be hard to recover from an addiction if you don't get the underlying problem treated. But some people believe that you can't treat the underlying problem without first getting the addiction out of the way.

While this controversy too continues, many are moving toward a model of treating both at at the same time. The so-called Dual Diagnosis Model of treatment. Addiction that's rooted in deeper psychological issues -- especially in emotional trauma like PTSD -- often require some version of dual treatment to untangle both issues. The good news is while PTSD and substance dependence may be distressing and complex, people can begin to heal given the chance and the resources. We're amazingly resilient creatures. When nurtured with the proper support and practice, we can overcome a lot. Today we talked about the causes and symptoms of PTSD and how trauma can affect the brain. We also looked at addiction, physical and psychological dependence, the relationship

between trauma and addiction, and why they can require dual treatment, and we touched on post-traumatic growth with the wisdom of Frodo Baggins.

- [00:00] All right, so you might have read "The Hobbit" or "The Lord of the Rings," you have probably
- [00:03] seen them, you've definitely heard of them. But not everyone knows the story of their
- [00:08] author, J.R.R. Tolkien. Tolkien was an English World War One veteran. A reluctant solider,
- [00:14] he joined up with a sense of duty and he lived through the bloody battle of Somme suffering
- [00:18] tremendous shock, guilt, and loss during and after the war.
- [00:22] It took Tolkien years to processes his experiences. To help him do it he turned to writing fiction
- [00:27] and in time he constructed a world that helped him and all of us better understand war, human
- [00:33] nature, loss, and growth. His novels were the bi-product of trauma and they're among
- [00:37] the more beautiful reminders of how it can affect us.
- [00:40] Most of us will experience some kind of traumatic event in our lives and most of us will exhibit
- [00:44] some kind of stress related behavior because of it, these symptoms usually fade but for
- [00:49] some those reactions can linger and start of disrupt their lives or the lives of those
- [00:53] around them. These reactions can develop into full blown psychological disorders including
- [00:58] post-traumatic stress disorder and, in an effort to cope, sometimes addiction, but it doesn't
- [01:02] always have to be that way.
- [01:04] Ultimately, Tolkien was able to harness the effect of his trauma and shape them into something
- [01:07] important and to reclaim is own life because there is such a thing as post-traumatic growth, too.
- [01:12] As it does with many other things psychology approaches trauma related disorders with different
- [01:17] perspectives, but they all tend to ask the same questions.
- [01:20] How do you identify and diagnose these disorders? And how do you treat them, so that the patients
- [01:25] can recover? -- With the understanding that they might never be the same as they were
- [01:29] before the trauma, but they can still be healthy and happy.
- [01:32] In a way, psychology helps patients ask themselves, what Tolkien asks his readers, and what Frodo
- [01:37] asks when he is finally safe back in the shire: "How do you pick up the threads of an old
- [01:41] life? How to go on, when in your heart, you begin to understand that there is no going back."
- [01:58] It could be September 11 or a serious car accident or a natural disaster or a violent
- [02:03] crime that you survived but are still haunted by. Trauma comes in many different forms and
- [02:07] sometimes it can stick with you.
- [02:09] When it manifests as nightmares, flashbacks, avoidance, fear, guilt, anxiety, rage, insomnia,
- [02:16] and begins to interfere with your ability to function it can come to be known as post-traumatic
- [02:20] stress disorder or PTSD.

### Transcript (reading)

It's perhaps the most stigmatized and misunderstood psychological disorder of them all, even among psychologists. Maybe because it's pretty rare, affecting about 1% of the population, schizophrenia causes more anxiety in the media, in the public, and even in doctors' offices than any other mental illness. As a result, its sufferers have often been shunned, abused, or locked up. And among the many fallacies that surround the disorder is simply what it means. The word "schizophrenia" literally means "split mind" but contrary to popular belief, the condition has nothing to do with a split in personality or multiple personalities. The term refers instead to what's sometimes called a "split from reality." Multiple Personality

Disorder, now known as Dissociative Identity Disorder, is a totally different type of condition, a kind of dissociative disorder. And these too, are shrouded in misconceptions, partly because they were the subject of, probably, the greatest psychological hoax of all time. While many of us can relate on some level to the emotional swings, nervousness, and compulsions that come with mood and anxiety disorders, it can be a lot harder for those without direct experience to relate to the symptoms of schizophrenia and dissociation. Unfortunately we tend to fear and avoid what we don't understand in each other, whether it's a friend of family member or just some stranger on the bus. But thankfully part of the psychologist's job is to demystify the things that can happen in our heads, and as is

often the case, understanding may be the key to compassion. Schizophrenia is a chronic condition that usually surfaces for men in their early to mid-20s, and for women in their late 20s. For some the disorder comes on gradually, but for others it could arise more suddenly, perhaps triggered by stress or trauma, although no event can actually cause the disorder. Once thought of as a single discrete condition, schizophrenia is now included in the DSM-5 as a point on a spectrum of disorders that vary in how they're expressed and how long they last, but they share similar symptoms. Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders are currently thought of as characterized by disorganized thinking; emotions and behaviors that are often incongruent with their situations; and

disturbed perceptions, including delusions and hallucinations. They all involve a kind of loss of contact with reality on some level. The resulting behaviors and mental states associated with this break from reality are generally called "psychotic symptoms" and they usually impair the ability to function. When someone's experiencing psychotic symptoms, their thinking and speech can become disorganized, rambling and fragmented. This tendency to pick up one train of thought and suddenly switch to another and then another can make communication painfully difficult. People exhibiting these symptoms can also suffer a breakdown in selective attention, losing the ability to focus on one thing while filtering others out.

In extreme cases, speech may become so fragmented it becomes little more than a string of meaningless words, a condition given a name that sounds like its own kind of non sequitur, "word salad." Classic schizophrenia is also often marked by delusions or false beliefs not based in reality. These delusions can be rooted in ideas of grandeur like "I'm the queen of England!" or "I won an Olympic gold medal for the luge!" Or they can become narratives of persecution and paranoia, believing your thoughts and actions are being controlled by an outside force or that you're being spied on or followed or that you're on the verge of a major catastrophe. And there are some complicated variations on these delusions, like feeling that you've

died or don't exist anymore or that someone is madly in love with you or that you're infested with parasites. Delusions of one kind of another strike as many as four out of five people with schizophrenia. While some delusions can seem fairly logical, they can also be severe and bizarre and frightening. Unfortunately maybe the most memorable examples of people suffering from severe delusions come from serial killers and yeah, while Son of Sam did claim that he was taking orders from his neighbor's dog, that kind of stuff is in the tiny, tiny, tiny minority. Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys and Syd Barrett of Pink Floyd both suffered psychotic symptoms. And then of course there's John Nash, the Nobel Prize winning American mathematician and subject of the movie "A Beautiful Mind."

Through proper treatment, some people with schizophrenia have not only learned to live with their illness but also made fantastic creative contributions to the world. Maybe people with schizophrenia also suffer from perceptual disturbances, or sensory experiences that come without any apparent sensory stimulation, like hallucinations. This is when a person sees or hears something that isn't there, often lacking the ability to understand what is real and what isn't. Auditory hallucinations, or hearing voices, are the most common form, and these voices are often abusive. It's as if you're inner monologue, that conversation that you have with yourself or the random things that float through your head, were somehow coming from

outside of you. It's as if you couldn't sort out whether the voices in your mind were internal and self-generated, or external and other-generated. To me, it sounds terrifying. Other common symptoms include disorganized, abnormal, or incongruent behavior and emotions. This could mean laughing when recalling a loved one's death or crying while others are laughing. Acting like a goofy child one minute, then becoming unpredictably angry or agitated the next. Movements may become inappropriate and compulsive, like continually rocking back and forth or remaining motionless for hours. Broadly, most psychotic symptoms fall into three general categories traditionally used by psychologists: positive, negative, and disorganized symptoms.

Positive symptoms are not what they sound like. They're the type that add something to the experience of the patient. Like, for example, hallucinations or inappropriate laughter or tears or delusional thoughts. Negative symptoms refer to those that subtract from normal behavior, like a reduced ability to function, neglect of personal hygiene, lack of emotion, toneless voice, expressionless face, or withdrawal from family and friends. Finally, disorganized symptoms are those jumbles of thought or speech that could include word salad and other problems with attention and organization. Symptoms like these are useful in diagnosing a disorder on the schizophrenia spectrum, but there's a physiological component too. Like many of the disorders we've talked about,

schizophrenia has been associated with a number of brain abnormalities. Post mortem research on schizophrenia patients has found that many have extra receptors for dopamine, a neurotransmitter involved in emotion regulation and the brain's pleasure and reward centers. Some researchers think that overly responsive dopamine systems might magnify brain activity in some way, perhaps creating hallucinations and other so-called positive symptoms as the brain loses its capacity to tell the difference between internal and external stimuli. For this reason, dopamine blocking drugs are often used as anti-psychotic medications in treatment. Modern neuroimaging studies also show that some people with schizophrenia have abnormal brain activity in several different parts of the brain.

One study noted that when patients were hallucinating, for example, there was unusually high activity in the thalamus, which is involved in filtering incoming sensory signals. Another study noted that patients with paranoid symptoms showed over-activity in the fear processing amygdala. So, schizophrenia seems to involve not just problems with one part of the brain, but abnormalities in several areas and their interconnections. But what might be causing these abnormalities? Earlier I mentioned how a stressful event might trigger psychotic symptoms for the first time, even though it can't actually create the disorder. Psychologists call this the "diathesis-stress model." This way of thinking involves a combination of biological and genetic vulnerabilities

-- diathesis -- and environmental stressors -- stress -- that both contribute to the onset of schizophrenia. This model helps explain why some people with genetic vulnerability might not always develop schizophrenia and why the rates of schizophrenia tend to be higher with some degree of poverty or socioeconomic stress. And it seems too that there is some kind of genetic predisposition for the disorder. The one-in-a-hundred odds of developing schizophrenia jumped to nearly one in ten if you have a parent or sibling with the disorder, with about 50/50 odds if that sibling is an identical twin, even if those twins were raised apart. One recent landmark seven year study looked at genetic samples across 35 countries, examining

more than 35,000 people with schizophrenia, and another 110,000 without the disorder. The study identified more than 100 genes that may increase the risk of schizophrenia. As expected, some of these genes involve dopamine regulation, but others are related to immune system functioning. Researchers continue to tease out what is exactly going on here, but many are hopeful that these new findings will lead to better treatment. Clearly, schizophrenia is a challenging disorder to live with and one that's hard for outsiders to understand, but maybe even more rare and more elusive are the dissociative disorders. These are disorders of consciousness, called dissociative because they're marked by an interruption in conscious awareness. Patients can become separated from the thoughts or

feelings that they used to have, which can result in a sudden loss of memory or even change in identity. Now, we might all experience minor dissociation at times, like maybe the sense that you're watching yourself from above, as in a movie, or like you're driving home and get so zoned out that suddenly you find yourself in front of Taco Bell thinking, like, "How did I get here?" Those things would generally fall into the normal range of dissociation, but most of us don't develop different personalities. Dissociative disorders come in several different forms, but the most infamous of the bunch is probably Dissociative Identity Disorder. This has long been known as Multiple Personality Disorder and, yes, it is a thing. It's a rare and flashy disorder in which a person exhibits

two or more distinct and alternating identities and the best known case was that of Shirley Mason, whose story was famously rendered in the 1973 best seller "Sybil" and later in a popular mini-series. The book was marketed as the true story of a woman who suffered great childhood trauma and ended up with 16 different personalities, ranging from Vicky, a selfish French Woman, to handyman Syd, to the religious and critical Clara. The book became a craze and within a few years reported cases of multiple personality skyrocketed from scarcely 100 to nearly 40,000. Many believe the book was essentially responsible for creating a new psychiatric diagnosis. It turns out though, Sybil's story was a big fat lie.

Yes, Shirley Mason was a real person and one with a troubled, traumatic past and a number of psychological issues. As a student in New York in the 1950s she started seeing a therapist named Connie Wilbur and taking some heavy medications. And somewhere in there, maybe because she was coaxed, or maybe because she wanted more attention, Shirley started expressing different personalities. Dr. Wilbur built a career and a book deal out of her star patient, even after Shirley confessed that her split personality was a ruse. The Sybil case is a powerful reminder that we really don't understand dissociative disorders very well or even know if they're always real. Indeed, some people question if Dissociative Identity Disorder is an actual disorder at all.

But some studies have shown distinct body and brain states that seem to appear in different identities, things like one personality being right handed while the other is left handed, or different personalities having variations in their eye sight that ophthalmologists could actually detect. In these cases, dissociations of identity may be in response to stress or anxiety, a sort of extreme coping mechanism. Either way, the debate and the research continue. Today we talked about the major symptoms associated with the schizophrenia spectrum disorders, including disorganized thinking, inappropriate emotions and behaviors, and disturbed perceptions. We also discussed brain activity associated with these disorders and talked about their possible origins including the diathesis stress model.

You also learned about dissociative disorders, and Dissociative Identity Disorder in particular, and the scandal that was the Sybil case.

### Transcript (navigation)

- [00:00] It's perhaps the most stigmatized and misunderstood psychological disorder of them all, even among
- [00:05] psychologists. Maybe because it's pretty rare, affecting about 1% of the population, schizophrenia
- [00:09] causes more anxiety in the media, in the public, and even in doctors' offices than any other mental illness.
- [00:16] As a result, its sufferers have often been shunned, abused, or locked up. And among the
- [00:20] many fallacies that surround the disorder is simply what it means. The word "schizophrenia"
- [00:25] literally means "split mind" but contrary to popular belief, the condition has nothing
- [00:30] to do with a split in personality or multiple personalities.
- [00:33] The term refers instead to what's sometimes called a "split from reality." Multiple Personality
- [00:38] Disorder, now known as Dissociative Identity Disorder, is a totally different type of condition,
- [00:44] a kind of dissociative disorder. And these too, are shrouded in misconceptions, partly
- [00:48] because they were the subject of, probably, the greatest psychological hoax of all time.
- [00:53] While many of us can relate on some level to the emotional swings, nervousness, and
- [00:57] compulsions that come with mood and anxiety disorders, it can be a lot harder for those
- [01:02] without direct experience to relate to the symptoms of schizophrenia and dissociation.
- [01:06] Unfortunately we tend to fear and avoid what we don't understand in each other, whether
- [01:10] it's a friend of family member or just some stranger on the bus. But thankfully part of
- [01:14] the psychologist's job is to demystify the things that can happen in our heads, and as is
- [01:18] often the case, understanding may be the key to compassion.
- [01:32] Schizophrenia is a chronic condition that usually surfaces for men in their early to
- [01:36] mid-20s, and for women in their late 20s. For some the disorder comes on gradually,
- [01:40] but for others it could arise more suddenly, perhaps triggered by stress or trauma, although
- [01:45] no event can actually cause the disorder.
- [01:48] Once thought of as a single discrete condition, schizophrenia is now included in the DSM-5
- [01:52] as a point on a spectrum of disorders that vary in how they're expressed and how long
- [01:57] they last, but they share similar symptoms.
- [01:59] Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders are currently thought of as characterized by disorganized
- [02:04] thinking; emotions and behaviors that are often incongruent with their situations; and
- [02:09] disturbed perceptions, including delusions and hallucinations.
- [02:12] They all involve a kind of loss of contact with reality on some level. The resulting
- [02:16] behaviors and mental states associated with this break from reality are generally called
- [02:21] "psychotic symptoms" and they usually impair the ability to function.
- [02:24] When someone's experiencing psychotic symptoms, their thinking and speech can become disorganized,
- [02:29] rambling and fragmented. This tendency to pick up one train of thought and suddenly
- [02:33] switch to another and then another can make communication painfully difficult.
- [02:38] People exhibiting these symptoms can also suffer a breakdown in selective attention,
- [02:42] losing the ability to focus on one thing while filtering others out.
- [02:45] In extreme cases, speech may become so fragmented it becomes little more than a string of meaningless
- [02:50] words, a condition given a name that sounds like its own kind of non sequitur, "word salad."
- [02:55] Classic schizophrenia is also often marked by delusions or false beliefs not based in
- [03:00] reality. These delusions can be rooted in ideas of grandeur like "I'm the queen of England!"
- [03:04] or "I won an Olympic gold medal for the luge!" Or they can become narratives of persecution
- [03:09] and paranoia, believing your thoughts and actions are being controlled by an outside
- [03:13] force or that you're being spied on or followed or that you're on the verge of a major catastrophe.
- [03:19] And there are some complicated variations on these delusions, like feeling that you've
- [03:22] died or don't exist anymore or that someone is madly in love with you or that you're infested with parasites.
- [03:28] Delusions of one kind of another strike as many as four out of five people with schizophrenia.
- [03:32] While some delusions can seem fairly logical, they can also be severe and bizarre and frightening.
- [03:38] Unfortunately maybe the most memorable examples of people suffering from severe delusions
- [03:42] come from serial killers and yeah, while Son of Sam did claim that he was taking orders
- [03:46] from his neighbor's dog, that kind of stuff is in the tiny, tiny, tiny minority.
- [03:50] Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys and Syd Barrett of Pink Floyd both suffered psychotic symptoms.
- [03:55] And then of course there's John Nash, the Nobel Prize winning American mathematician
- [03:58] and subject of the movie "A Beautiful Mind."
- [04:00] Through proper treatment, some people with schizophrenia have not only learned to live
- [04:04] with their illness but also made fantastic creative contributions to the world.
- [04:08] Maybe people with schizophrenia also suffer from perceptual disturbances, or sensory experiences
- [04:12] that come without any apparent sensory stimulation, like hallucinations. This is when a person
- [04:17] sees or hears something that isn't there, often lacking the ability to understand what is real and what isn't.
- [04:23] Auditory hallucinations, or hearing voices, are the most common form, and these voices
- [04:27] are often abusive. It's as if you're inner monologue, that conversation that you have
- [04:31] with yourself or the random things that float through your head, were somehow coming from
- [04:34] outside of you. It's as if you couldn't sort out whether the voices in your mind were internal
- [04:39] and self-generated, or external and other-generated.
- [04:41] To me, it sounds terrifying.
- [04:44] Other common symptoms include disorganized, abnormal, or incongruent behavior and emotions.
- [04:49] This could mean laughing when recalling a loved one's death or crying while others are
- [04:53] laughing. Acting like a goofy child one minute, then becoming unpredictably angry or agitated the next.
- [04:58] Movements may become inappropriate and compulsive, like continually rocking back and forth or
- [05:02] remaining motionless for hours.
- [05:04] Broadly, most psychotic symptoms fall into three general categories traditionally used
- [05:08] by psychologists: positive, negative, and disorganized symptoms.
- [05:13] Positive symptoms are not what they sound like. They're the type that add something
- [05:17] to the experience of the patient. Like, for example, hallucinations or inappropriate laughter
- [05:21] or tears or delusional thoughts.
- [05:23] Negative symptoms refer to those that subtract from normal behavior, like a reduced ability
- [05:28] to function, neglect of personal hygiene, lack of emotion, toneless voice, expressionless
- [05:33] face, or withdrawal from family and friends.
- [05:36] Finally, disorganized symptoms are those jumbles of thought or speech that could include word
- [05:40] salad and other problems with attention and organization.
- [05:44] Symptoms like these are useful in diagnosing a disorder on the schizophrenia spectrum,
- [05:47] but there's a physiological component too. Like many of the disorders we've talked about,
- [05:52] schizophrenia has been associated with a number of brain abnormalities.
- [05:55] Post mortem research on schizophrenia patients has found that many have extra receptors for
- [05:59] dopamine, a neurotransmitter involved in emotion regulation and the brain's pleasure and reward centers.
- [06:04] Some researchers think that overly responsive dopamine systems might magnify brain activity
- [06:09] in some way, perhaps creating hallucinations and other so-called positive symptoms as the
- [06:14] brain loses its capacity to tell the difference between internal and external stimuli.
- [06:18] For this reason, dopamine blocking drugs are often used as anti-psychotic medications in
- [06:23] treatment. Modern neuroimaging studies also show that some people with schizophrenia have
- [06:26] abnormal brain activity in several different parts of the brain.
- [06:29] One study noted that when patients were hallucinating, for example, there was unusually high activity
- [06:34] in the thalamus, which is involved in filtering incoming sensory signals. Another study noted
- [06:39] that patients with paranoid symptoms showed over-activity in the fear processing amygdala.
- [06:43] So, schizophrenia seems to involve not just problems with one part of the brain, but abnormalities
- [06:47] in several areas and their interconnections.
- [06:50] But what might be causing these abnormalities?
- [06:52] Earlier I mentioned how a stressful event might trigger psychotic symptoms for the first
- [06:56] time, even though it can't actually create the disorder. Psychologists call this the
- [07:00] "diathesis-stress model."
- [07:02] This way of thinking involves a combination of biological and genetic vulnerabilities
- [07:06] -- diathesis -- and environmental stressors -- stress -- that both contribute to the onset
- [07:11] of schizophrenia. This model helps explain why some people with genetic vulnerability
- [07:14] might not always develop schizophrenia and why the rates of schizophrenia tend to be
- [07:19] higher with some degree of poverty or socioeconomic stress.
- [07:22] And it seems too that there is some kind of genetic predisposition for the disorder. The
- [07:26] one-in-a-hundred odds of developing schizophrenia jumped to nearly one in ten if you have a
- [07:30] parent or sibling with the disorder, with about 50/50 odds if that sibling is an identical
- [07:35] twin, even if those twins were raised apart.
- [07:38] One recent landmark seven year study looked at genetic samples across 35 countries, examining
- [07:43] more than 35,000 people with schizophrenia, and another 110,000 without the disorder.
- [07:48] The study identified more than 100 genes that may increase the risk of schizophrenia. As
- [07:53] expected, some of these genes involve dopamine regulation, but others are related to immune
- [07:57] system functioning. Researchers continue to tease out what is exactly going on here, but
- [08:02] many are hopeful that these new findings will lead to better treatment.
- [08:05] Clearly, schizophrenia is a challenging disorder to live with and one that's hard for outsiders
- [08:10] to understand, but maybe even more rare and more elusive are the dissociative disorders.
- [08:15] These are disorders of consciousness, called dissociative because they're marked by an
- [08:19] interruption in conscious awareness. Patients can become separated from the thoughts or
- [08:24] feelings that they used to have, which can result in a sudden loss of memory or even
- [08:28] change in identity.
- [08:29] Now, we might all experience minor dissociation at times, like maybe the sense that you're
- [08:34] watching yourself from above, as in a movie, or like you're driving home and get so zoned
- [08:38] out that suddenly you find yourself in front of Taco Bell thinking, like, "How did I get here?"
- [08:42] Those things would generally fall into the normal range of dissociation, but most of
- [08:46] us don't develop different personalities.
- [08:49] Dissociative disorders come in several different forms, but the most infamous of the bunch
- [08:52] is probably Dissociative Identity Disorder. This has long been known as Multiple Personality
- [08:57] Disorder and, yes, it is a thing. It's a rare and flashy disorder in which a person exhibits
- [09:02] two or more distinct and alternating identities and the best known case was that of Shirley
- [09:07] Mason, whose story was famously rendered in the 1973 best seller "Sybil" and later in
- [09:12] a popular mini-series.
- [09:13] The book was marketed as the true story of a woman who suffered great childhood trauma
- [09:17] and ended up with 16 different personalities, ranging from Vicky, a selfish French Woman,
- [09:23] to handyman Syd, to the religious and critical Clara.
- [09:26] The book became a craze and within a few years reported cases of multiple personality skyrocketed
- [09:32] from scarcely 100 to nearly 40,000.

### Transcript (reading)

When Lauren was fifteen years old, her family moved across the country and she started going to a new school. Already shy, Lauren suffered from low self-confidence and had a hard time transitioning; nothing felt right and soon her changing body became a source of insecurity. Eventually, she began thinking that maybe if she lost weight and focused on fitness, she'd make more friends and feel better about herself and life would get better. Soon she became obsessed with dieting and it quickly spiraled into her subsisting only on rice cakes and apples and candy corn and celery. She like this new feeling of control every time she stood on the scale and saw a lower number. She was achieving something, and that made her feel good. Soon, she thought of nothing else.

But what Lauren couldn't see was that she was no longer healthy. Even when her hair started falling out and her skin grew dry and cracked, and when she could never get warm. When she looked in the mirror, she still saw a chubby girl. Her family, though, did notice, and yet, at a visit to the doctor, she was just told to eat more. She didn't. One day while jogging, she had a heart attack and collapsed. As a teenager, she was 5'7" and weighed eighty-two pounds. Lauren was finally admitted to a psychiatric hospital where she was treated for anorexia nervosa. She was put on bed rest, saw a therapist twice a week, joined a support group and slowly began eating small amounts of food again. Her recovery was slow but, with the support of her family and doctors, she was released eight months later. Though Lauren suffered a few relapses over the years, she is now healthy.

Ultimately, she was lucky. Anorexia, bulimia, and other eating and body dysmorphic disorders can kill. Eating disorders are among the deadliest psychological disorders, with some of the highest rates of death directly attributable to the illness. They slowly ruin the body, but, in order for these conditions to be recognized and treated successfully, they have to be understood as disorders of the mind. Eating Disorder Statistics Here's some scary figures: According to the National Eating Disorder Association, forty-two percent of first to third grade girls want to be thinner; eighty-one percent of ten year olds are afraid of being fat; over half of teenage girls and nearly a third of teenage boys have used troubling weight control methods like fasting, skipping meals, smoking, vomiting, or taking laxatives.

The rate of new cases of eating disorders in Western culture has been increasing since the 1950's, and today in the US, an estimated twenty million women and ten million men have suffered from a clinically significant eating disorder at some point in their lives. But get this straight: we're not talking about fad diets or lifestyle choices spurred by vanity. Eating disorders are psychological illnesses that often come with serious consequences. These disorders tend to fall into three main categories: anorexia, bulimia, and binge eating disorders. Anorexia Nervosa Those suffering from anorexia nervosa, most often adolescent females, essentially maintain a starving diet and, eventually, and abnormally low body weight. As in Lauren's case, anorexia can begin as a diet that quickly spirals out of control as a person becomes obsessed with

continued weight loss, all while still feeling overweight. Our old friend, the DSM V, actually delineates two sub types of the disorder. The first involves restriction, which usually consists of an extremely low-calorie diet, excessive exercise, or purging, like vomiting or the use of laxatives. The second type is the binge/purge sub type, which involves episodes of binge eating combined with the restriction behavior. As you can easily imagine, the physiological effects of this psychological condition can be devastating. As the body is denied crucial nutrients, it slows down to conserve what little energy it has, often resulting in abnormally slow heart rate, loss of bone density, fatigue, muscle weakness, hair loss, severe dehydration, and an extremely low body mass index.

And it's that low body mass that's the defining characteristic of anorexia nervosa - a refusal to maintain a weight at or above what would normally be considered minimally healthy. If this condition persists, of course, it can be deadly, which is why anorexia has what's often estimated to be the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder. That might surprise you, given the host of troubling disorders we've already covered here on Crash Course Psychology, but mortality rates associated with, say, major depression or PTSD or schizophrenia tend to be the result of secondary behavior, like suicide. But with anorexia, the mortality rate is especially high because people can die as a direct result of extreme weight loss and physiological damage. Bulimia Nervosa Another common eating disorder is bulimia nervosa.

While anorexia is characterized primarily by the refusal to maintain a minimal body weight, bulimia is not. People with bulimia tend to maintain an apparently normal, or at least minimally healthy, body weight, but alternate between binge eating, followed by fasting or purging, often by vomiting or using laxatives. A bulimic body may not be as obviously underweight as an anorexic one, but that addictive cycle of binging and purging can seriously damage the whole digestive system, leading to irregular heartbeat, inflammation of the esophagus and mouth, tooth decay and staining, irregular bowel movements, peptic ulcers, pancreatitis, and other organ damage. Sometimes the two diagnoses can be difficult to discern, especially because someone may shift back and forth between anorexic diagnostic features and bulimic diagnostic features.

The DSM V recently added a third category called binge-eating disorder, which is marked Binge-Eating Disorder by significant binge-eating, followed by emotional distress, feelings of lack of control, disgust, or guilt, but without purging or fasting. Causes of Eating Disorders Although sometimes triggered by stress or a need for, or lack of, control, the presence of an eating disorder is not a tell-tale sign of childhood sexual abuse, as was once commonly thought. Instead, these disorders are often predictive indicators of a person's feelings of low self-worth, need to be perfect, falling short of expectations, and concern with others perceptions. Although the prevalence of bulimia and binge-eating is similar among ethnic groups in the United Social & Cultural Components of Eating Disorders States, anorexia is is much more common among white women, often of higher socioeconomic status.

But the prevalence of these disorders is rising in males, too. Today, between ten and twenty percent of people diagnosed with eating disorders are men who feel the same pressure to attain what they imagine is physical perfection, and that's worth noting. These disorders have strong cultural and gender components; the so-called "ideal standard of beauty" varies wildly across cultures and time, and thinness is far from a universal desire, especially in countries where malnutrition and starvation are problems. But in the Western world, and increasingly in other countries, thinness is a common pursuit. And being bombarded with images of unrealistically slender models and jacked celebrities has increased many people's dissatisfaction, or even shame and disgust, with their own bodies.

These are all attitudes that can contribute to eating disorders. Some people have even had plastic surgery to look more like Beyonce, or J-Lo, or...Barbie. Body Dysmorphic Disorders When taken to extremes, this kind of behavior starts inching into the realm of body dysmorphic disorder. Body dysmorphic disorder is another psychological illness, one that centers on a person's obsession with physical flaws - either minor or just imagined. Those suffering from this disorder often obsess over their appearance, often staring into mirrors for hours, and feel distressed or ashamed by what they see. Although it's often lumped in with the eating disorders, our growing understanding of body dysmorphia suggests that it actually shares some traits with obsessive-compulsive disorder, particularly the obsession with some imagined bodily perfection and the compulsion to check

oneself over and over to discern perceived flaws. Not surprisingly, BDD and OCD may share some similar neurophysiological features, although that's still being researched. People suffering from BDD may exercise excessively, groom themselves excessively, or seek out extreme cosmetic procedures, but, unless treated, they usually remain critical and unsatisfied with their looks, to the point of fearing that they have a deformity. People with BDD may suffer from anxiety and depression, start avoiding social situations, and stay home for fear that others will notice and judge their appearance negatively. Obviously, this causes a lot of emotional distress and dysfunction. Some bodybuilders suffer from a particular type of BDD called muscle dysmorphia, sort of the opposite of anorexia, where they become obsessed with the notion that they aren't muscular enough,

even if they're ripping shirts like the Hulk. And again, this isn't mere vanity; people suffering from body dysmorphia disorder look in the mirror and often see a distorted, even grotesque, image in their reflection. Eating Disorders & the Brain So, how do these disorders come about? Well, to be honest, we still have a lot of dots to connect. Neurologically, there are a few compelling clues. In the case of eating disorders, for example, research has long suggested that neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine may play a role. Dopamine is involved in regions of the brain connected to hunger and eating, like the hypothalamus and nucleus accumbens, and some research has found that binge eating appears to alter the regulation of dopamine production in a way that can reinforce further binging.

The result is a neurological pattern that can resemble drug addiction, although the addiction comparison is still pretty controversial. Genetic, Familial, & Environmental Factors Genetics appear to play a role, too, as there seems to be increased risk among genetic relatives with eating disorders as compared to controls. But a lot of attention is also being paid to environmental and familial factors, particularly the behavioral modeling and learning processes that shape how we think about ourselves and our bodies. Specifically, children who grow up observing problematic or unhealthy eating behavior in parents may be at higher risk for developing an eating disorder. And explicitly learning unreasonable or unhealthy values about your weight or your shape from your family, and definitely from your peers, can have a powerful effect.

Eating and body dysmorphic disorders are serious business, but they are treatable -- and perhaps even preventable. If cultural learning contributes to how we eat and how we want to look, then maybe education can help increase our acceptance of our own appearance, and be more accepting of others. Today, you learned about the symptoms and sub types of anorexia, bulimia, and binge-eating Review & Credits disorder, as well as various types of body dysmorphic disorder, and some of the physiological and environmental roots of these conditions.

- [2:00] percent of first to third grade girls want to be thinner; eighty-one percent of ten year
- [2:04] olds are afraid of being fat; over half of teenage girls and nearly a third of teenage
- [2:09] boys have used troubling weight control methods like fasting, skipping meals, smoking, vomiting,
- [2:14] or taking laxatives.
- [2:15] The rate of new cases of eating disorders in Western culture has been increasing since
- [2:19] the 1950's, and today in the US, an estimated twenty million women and ten million men have
- [2:24] suffered from a clinically significant eating disorder at some point in their lives.
- [2:29] But get this straight: we're not talking about fad diets or lifestyle choices spurred by
- [2:33] vanity. Eating disorders are psychological illnesses that often come with serious consequences.
- [2:38] These disorders tend to fall into three main categories: anorexia, bulimia, and binge eating disorders.
- [2:38] Anorexia Nervosa
- [2:44] Those suffering from anorexia nervosa, most often adolescent females, essentially maintain
- [2:48] a starving diet and, eventually, and abnormally low body weight. As in Lauren's case, anorexia
- [2:54] can begin as a diet that quickly spirals out of control as a person becomes obsessed with
- [2:58] continued weight loss, all while still feeling overweight.
- [3:02] Our old friend, the DSM V, actually delineates two sub types of the disorder. The first involves
- [3:06] restriction, which usually consists of an extremely low-calorie diet, excessive exercise,
- [3:11] or purging, like vomiting or the use of laxatives. The second type is the binge/purge sub type,
- [3:16] which involves episodes of binge eating combined with the restriction behavior.
- [3:19] As you can easily imagine, the physiological effects of this psychological condition can
- [3:23] be devastating. As the body is denied crucial nutrients, it slows down to conserve what
- [3:27] little energy it has, often resulting in abnormally slow heart rate, loss of bone density, fatigue,
- [3:33] muscle weakness, hair loss, severe dehydration, and an extremely low body mass index.
- [3:37] And it's that low body mass that's the defining characteristic of anorexia nervosa - a refusal
- [3:42] to maintain a weight at or above what would normally be considered minimally healthy.
- [3:47] If this condition persists, of course, it can be deadly, which is why anorexia has what's
- [3:51] often estimated to be the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder.
- [3:56] That might surprise you, given the host of troubling disorders we've already covered
- [4:00] here on Crash Course Psychology, but mortality rates associated with, say, major depression
- [4:04] or PTSD or schizophrenia tend to be the result of secondary behavior, like suicide. But with
- [4:10] anorexia, the mortality rate is especially high because people can die as a direct result
- [4:14] of extreme weight loss and physiological damage.
- [4:14] Bulimia Nervosa
- [4:17] Another common eating disorder is bulimia nervosa.
- [4:20] While anorexia is characterized primarily by the refusal to maintain a minimal body
- [4:24] weight, bulimia is not. People with bulimia tend to maintain an apparently normal, or
- [4:28] at least minimally healthy, body weight, but alternate between binge eating, followed by
- [4:33] fasting or purging, often by vomiting or using laxatives.
- [4:36] A bulimic body may not be as obviously underweight as an anorexic one, but that addictive cycle
- [4:42] of binging and purging can seriously damage the whole digestive system, leading to irregular
- [4:47] heartbeat, inflammation of the esophagus and mouth, tooth decay and staining, irregular
- [4:51] bowel movements, peptic ulcers, pancreatitis, and other organ damage.
- [4:56] Sometimes the two diagnoses can be difficult to discern, especially because someone may
- [4:59] shift back and forth between anorexic diagnostic features and bulimic diagnostic features.
- [5:03] The DSM V recently added a third category called binge-eating disorder, which is marked
- [5:03] Binge-Eating Disorder
- [5:08] by significant binge-eating, followed by emotional distress, feelings of lack of control, disgust,
- [5:14] or guilt, but without purging or fasting.
- [5:14] Causes of Eating Disorders
- [5:17] Although sometimes triggered by stress or a need for, or lack of, control, the presence
- [5:21] of an eating disorder is not a tell-tale sign of childhood sexual abuse, as was once commonly
- [5:26] thought. Instead, these disorders are often predictive indicators of a person's feelings
- [5:30] of low self-worth, need to be perfect, falling short of expectations, and concern with others perceptions.
- [5:36] Although the prevalence of bulimia and binge-eating is similar among ethnic groups in the United
- [5:36] Social & Cultural Components of Eating Disorders
- [5:40] States, anorexia is is much more common among white women, often of higher socioeconomic status.
- [5:46] But the prevalence of these disorders is rising in males, too. Today, between ten and twenty
- [5:50] percent of people diagnosed with eating disorders are men who feel the same pressure to attain
- [5:55] what they imagine is physical perfection, and that's worth noting.
- [5:58] These disorders have strong cultural and gender components; the so-called "ideal standard
- [6:03] of beauty" varies wildly across cultures and time, and thinness is far from a universal
- [6:09] desire, especially in countries where malnutrition and starvation are problems.
- [6:12] But in the Western world, and increasingly in other countries, thinness is a common pursuit.
- [6:17] And being bombarded with images of unrealistically slender models and jacked celebrities has
- [6:22] increased many people's dissatisfaction, or even shame and disgust, with their own bodies.
- [6:27] These are all attitudes that can contribute to eating disorders.
- [6:30] Some people have even had plastic surgery to look more like Beyonce, or J-Lo, or...Barbie.
- [6:30] Body Dysmorphic Disorders
- [6:35] When taken to extremes, this kind of behavior starts inching into the realm of body dysmorphic disorder.
- [6:39] Body dysmorphic disorder is another psychological illness, one that centers on a person's obsession
- [6:43] with physical flaws - either minor or just imagined. Those suffering from this disorder
- [6:47] often obsess over their appearance, often staring into mirrors for hours, and feel distressed
- [6:52] or ashamed by what they see.
- [6:54] Although it's often lumped in with the eating disorders, our growing understanding of body
- [6:58] dysmorphia suggests that it actually shares some traits with obsessive-compulsive disorder,
- [7:02] particularly the obsession with some imagined bodily perfection and the compulsion to check
- [7:07] oneself over and over to discern perceived flaws.
- [7:10] Not surprisingly, BDD and OCD may share some similar neurophysiological features, although
- [7:15] that's still being researched.
- [7:17] People suffering from BDD may exercise excessively, groom themselves excessively, or seek out
- [7:22] extreme cosmetic procedures, but, unless treated, they usually remain critical and unsatisfied
- [7:27] with their looks, to the point of fearing that they have a deformity.
- [7:31] People with BDD may suffer from anxiety and depression, start avoiding social situations,
- [7:36] and stay home for fear that others will notice and judge their appearance negatively.
- [7:40] Obviously, this causes a lot of emotional distress and dysfunction. Some bodybuilders
- [7:43] suffer from a particular type of BDD called muscle dysmorphia, sort of the opposite of
- [7:48] anorexia, where they become obsessed with the notion that they aren't muscular enough,
- [7:52] even if they're ripping shirts like the Hulk.
- [7:54] And again, this isn't mere vanity; people suffering from body dysmorphia disorder look
- [7:58] in the mirror and often see a distorted, even grotesque, image in their reflection.
- [7:58] Eating Disorders & the Brain
- [8:03] So, how do these disorders come about?
- [8:05] Well, to be honest, we still have a lot of dots to connect.
- [8:08] Neurologically, there are a few compelling clues. In the case of eating disorders, for
- [8:11] example, research has long suggested that neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine
- [8:15] may play a role.
- [8:16] Dopamine is involved in regions of the brain connected to hunger and eating, like the hypothalamus
- [8:21] and nucleus accumbens, and some research has found that binge eating appears to alter the
- [8:24] regulation of dopamine production in a way that can reinforce further binging.
- [8:28] The result is a neurological pattern that can resemble drug addiction, although the
- [8:32] addiction comparison is still pretty controversial.
- [8:32] Genetic, Familial, & Environmental Factors
- [8:34] Genetics appear to play a role, too, as there seems to be increased risk among genetic relatives
- [8:38] with eating disorders as compared to controls.
- [8:40] But a lot of attention is also being paid to environmental and familial factors, particularly
- [8:44] the behavioral modeling and learning processes that shape how we think about ourselves and
- [8:49] our bodies. Specifically, children who grow up observing problematic or unhealthy eating
- [8:53] behavior in parents may be at higher risk for developing an eating disorder. And explicitly
- [8:58] learning unreasonable or unhealthy values about your weight or your shape from your
- [9:02] family, and definitely from your peers, can have a powerful effect.
- [9:06] Eating and body dysmorphic disorders are serious business, but they are treatable --
- [9:10] and perhaps even preventable.
- [9:11] If cultural learning contributes to how we eat and how we want to look, then maybe education
- [9:16] can help increase our acceptance of our own appearance, and be more accepting of others.
- [9:20] Today, you learned about the symptoms and sub types of anorexia, bulimia, and binge-eating

### Transcript (reading)

I can be smooth and charming and slick. I can make a very confident impression and it's hard to leave me at a loss for words. Sometimes I find myself fantasizing about unlimited success and power, and beauty. I have repeatedly used deceit to cheat, con, or defraud others for my personal gain. To be honest, I don't have much concern for the feelings of other people, or their suffering. Doesn't sound like the Hank you know, does it? These are all statements from the Self-Assessment measure for Personality Disorders, that lets patients describe themselves, ranking each statement in terms of how accurate they think it is. To be honest, you can't rely too much on this kind of self-reporting to assess what we are

talking about today because while some people who are over-confident or obsessed with power or downright deceitful might tell you that they are, there is a certain subset that won't. Many of the disorders that we have talked about so far are considered, "ego-dystonic" meaning that people who have them are aware that they have a problem and tend to be distressed by their symptoms. Like a person with Bipolar Disorder or OCD generally knows that they have a psychological condition and they don't like what it does to them. But some disorders are trickier then that. They are "ego-syntonic," the person experiencing them doesn't necessarily think that they have a problem and sometimes, they think the problem is with everyone else.

Personality disorders fall into this category. These are psychological disorders marked by inflexible, disruptive, and enduring behavior patterns that impair social and other functioning -- whether the sufferer recognizes that or not. Unlike many other conditions that we've talked about, personality disorders are often considered to be chronic and enduring syndromes that create noticeable problems in life. And as you can tell from these self assessment statements, they can range from relatively harmless displays of narcissism, to a true and troubling lack of empathy for other people. Not only can personality disorders be difficult to diagnose and understand, they can also be downright scary. Most of the extreme and severe disorders go by names that you probably

recognize: psychopathy and sociopathy. I'm talking, like, serial killers here, mob bosses, Vlad the Impaler. Cultures have been studying human personality characteristics for thousands of years, but the concept of personality disorders is a much newer idea. Much of our modern classifications of these disorders are based on the work of German psychiatrist, Kurt Schneider, who was one of the earliest researchers into what was then known as psychopathy and published a treatise on the study in 1923. Today, the DSM 5 contains ten distinct personality disorder diagnoses, grouped into three clusters. The first cluster, cluster A, includes what are often labeled simply as "odd" or "eccentric" personality characteristics. For example, someone with paranoid personality disorder

may feel a pervasive distrust of others and be constantly guarded and suspicious while a person with a schizoid personality disorder would seem overly aloof and indifferent, showing no interest in relationships and few emotional responses. Cluster B encompasses dramatic emotional or impulsive personality characteristics. For example, a narcissistic personality can display a selfish grandiose sense of self-importance and entitlement. Meanwhile, a histrionic personality might seem like they're acting a part to get attention, even putting themselves at risk with dramatic, dangerous, and even suicidal gestures. The behavior of Cluster B can be truly self-destructive and frightening, and these disorders are often associated with frequent hospitalization.

Finally, Cluster C encompasses anxious, fearful, or avoidant personality traits. For example, those with avoidant and dependent personality disorders often avoid meeting new people or taking risks and show a lack of confidence, an excessive need to be taken care of, and a tremendous fear of being abandoned. Now, in the past, and, to a great extent, today, some of these categories have been controversial. Many researchers argue that some of these conditions overlap with each other so much that it can be impossible to tease them apart. Narcissistic personality disorder, for example, has many traits that resemble histrionic personality disorder. And because of this gray area, the most commonly diagnosed personality disorder

is actually personality disorder not otherwise specified or PDNOS. The prevalence of this diagnosis suggests that while clinicians can identify a personality disorder in a patient, figuring out the details of the condition can be messy and difficult. One proposed alternative for diagnosing these disorders is the Dimensional Model, which, in essence, gets rid of discrete disorders and replaces them with a range of personality traits or symptoms, rating each person on each dimension. So the Dimensional Model would assess a patient not with the aim of diagnosing one disorder or another, but instead, simply finding out that they rank high on say, narcissism and avoidance. It's a work in progress, so

with another generation, the clinical definition of "personality disorder" may evolve pretty radically. One of the best-studied personality disorders right now is Borderline Personality Disorder, or BPD. Borderline makes it sounds like patients are like, pretty close to being healthy, but not quite, but that is not at all the case. BPD sufferers have often learned to use dysfunctional, unhealthy ways to get their basic psychological needs met, like love and validation, by using things like outbursts of rage, or on the other end of the spectrum, self-injury behaviors like cutting or worse. People with BPD were once commonly maligned by clinicians as 'difficult' or 'attention-seeking', but we now understand BPD as a complicated set of learned behaviors

and emotional responses to traumatic or neglectful environments, particularly in childhood. In a sense, people with this disorder learn that rage or self-harm helped them cope with traumatic situations, but as a result, they also end up using them in non-traumatic situations. Although challenging for patients and clinicians alike, the good news is that some psychotherapies have helped even the most severely suffering, repeatedly hospitalized BPD patients. But probably the most famous well-established, and frankly, troubling personality disorder is Antisocial Personality Disorder. Now, you've heard of this before, but maybe by one of its now somewhat out of vogue synonyms, "psychopathy" or "sociopathy." People with Antisocial Personality

Disorder, usually men, exhibit a lack of conscience for wrongdoing, even towards friends and family members. Their destructive behavior surfaces in childhood or adolescence, beginning with excessive lying, fighting, stealing, violence, or manipulation. As adults, people with this disorder are thought to generally end up in one of two situations: either they are unable to keep a job and engage in violent criminal or similarly dysfunctional behavior; or they become clever, charming con-artists, or ruthless executives who make their way to positions of power. Tony Soprano would have qualified for a diagnosis, even if he wasn't nearly as bad as, say, serial killer Ted Bundy or Vlad the Impaler, the infamous 15th century

Romanian prince who personally watched about 100,000 people get impaled or have the skin of their feet licked off by goats. Yeah. That happened. Despite this classic remorselessness, lack of empathy, and sometimes criminal behavior, criminality is not always a component of antisocial behavior. Certainly many people with criminal records don't fit that psychopathic profile. Most show remorse, love, and concern for friends and family. But still, although anti-social personalities make up just about 1% of the general population, they were estimated in one study to constitute about 16% of the incarcerated population. So, how might someone end up with such a disturbing disorder? Well, as you might expect, the causes

are probably a tangled combination of biological and psychological threads, both genetic and environmental. Although no one has found a single genetic predictor of Antisocial Personality Disorder, twin and adoption studies do show that relatives of those with psychopathic features do have a higher likelihood of engaging in psychopathic behavior themselves. And early signs are sometimes detected as young as age three or four, often as an impairment in fear conditioning, in other words, lower than normal response to things that typically startle or frighten children like loud and unpleasant noises. Most kids only need to get burned by a hot dish once to know to stay away, but kids who end up displaying Antisocial Personalities

as adults don't necessarily connect or care about the learned consequences when they're little. From there, like we've seen in other disorders, genetic and biological influences can intersect with an abusive or neglectful environment to help wire the personality in a peculiar and damaged way. While the vast majority of traumatized people don't grow up to be killers or con-artists, genes do seem to predispose some people to be more sensitive to abuse or trauma. Meanwhile, studies exploring the neural basis of Antisocial Disorder have revealed that when shown evocative photographs, like a child being hit or a woman with a knife at her throat, those with psychopathic personality features showed little change in heart rate and perspiration, as compared to control groups.

And the classic antisocial lack of impulse control and other symptoms have also been linked to deficits in certain brain structures. One study compared PET scans from 41 people convicted of murder to those of non-criminals and found that the convicted killers had greatly reduced activity in the frontal lobe, an area associated with impulse control and keeping aggressive behavior in check. In fact, violent repeat offenders had as much as 11% less frontal lobe tissue than the average brain. Their brains also responded less to facial displays of stress or anguish, something that's also observed in childhood, so it's possible that some antisocial personalities lack empathy because they simply don't or can't register

others' feelings. Research has also suggested an overly reactive dopamine reward system, suggesting that the drive to act on an impulse to gain stimulation or short-term rewards regardless of the consequences may be more intense than the average person's. As we mentioned before, because personality disorders are pretty much egosyntonic by definition, people don't often acknowledge that they have a problem or a need for treatment - and in the case of Antisocial Personality Disorder, even if they did, there aren't many specific treatments available, at least not for adults. But there are some promising interventions for kids and adolescents whose minds and brains are more plastic and adaptable. In this way, the best way to treat Antisocial Personality

Disorder may be in trying to prevent it. According to American psychiatrist Donald W. Black, among others, many kids diagnosed with Conduct Disorder, the diagnostic precursor to Antisocial Disorder, are at high-risk for developing Antisocial Personalities as adults. But by identifying warning signs early on and by working with these kids and families to correct their behavior and remove negative influences, some of that impulse fearlessness could be channeled into healthier directions, like to reward promoting athleticism, or a spirit of adventure. It's important to remember that Antisocial Personality Disorder is only one type of personality disorder. This is a diverse family of psychological conditions determined

by many different factors and we're still in the early stages of diagnosing and understanding the mechanisms behind them. Today, you learned about personality disorders and the difference between ego-dystonic and ego-syntonic disorders. We looked at the three clusters of personality disorder, according to the DSM V, and how personality disorder symptoms often overlap. We also took a look at Borderline and Antisocial Personality Disorders, including their potential bio-psycho-social roots.

- [06:34] criminality is not always a component of antisocial behavior. Certainly many people with criminal
- [06:39] records don't fit that psychopathic profile. Most show remorse, love, and concern for friends
- [06:44] and family. But still, although anti-social personalities make up just about 1% of the
- [06:49] general population, they were estimated in one study to constitute about 16% of the incarcerated population.
- [06:54] So, how might someone end up with such a disturbing disorder? Well, as you might expect, the causes
- [06:59] are probably a tangled combination of biological and psychological threads, both genetic and environmental.
- [07:04] Although no one has found a single genetic predictor of Antisocial Personality Disorder,
- [07:09] twin and adoption studies do show that relatives of those with psychopathic features do have
- [07:13] a higher likelihood of engaging in psychopathic behavior themselves. And early signs are sometimes
- [07:18] detected as young as age three or four, often as an impairment in fear conditioning, in
- [07:23] other words, lower than normal response to things that typically startle or frighten
- [07:27] children like loud and unpleasant noises. Most kids only need to get burned by a hot
- [07:31] dish once to know to stay away, but kids who end up displaying Antisocial Personalities
- [07:34] as adults don't necessarily connect or care about the learned consequences when they're little.
- [07:39] From there, like we've seen in other disorders, genetic and biological influences can intersect
- [07:44] with an abusive or neglectful environment to help wire the personality in a peculiar
- [07:48] and damaged way. While the vast majority of traumatized people don't grow up to be killers
- [07:52] or con-artists, genes do seem to predispose some people to be more sensitive to abuse or trauma.
- [07:58] Meanwhile, studies exploring the neural basis of Antisocial Disorder have revealed that
- [08:02] when shown evocative photographs, like a child being hit or a woman with a knife at her throat,
- [08:07] those with psychopathic personality features showed little change in heart rate and perspiration,
- [08:12] as compared to control groups.
- [08:13] And the classic antisocial lack of impulse control and other symptoms have also been
- [08:17] linked to deficits in certain brain structures. One study compared PET scans from 41 people
- [08:21] convicted of murder to those of non-criminals and found that the convicted killers had greatly
- [08:26] reduced activity in the frontal lobe, an area associated with impulse control and keeping
- [08:30] aggressive behavior in check. In fact, violent repeat offenders had as much as 11% less frontal
- [08:35] lobe tissue than the average brain. Their brains also responded less to facial displays
- [08:39] of stress or anguish, something that's also observed in childhood, so it's possible that
- [08:44] some antisocial personalities lack empathy because they simply don't or can't register
- [08:48] others' feelings. Research has also suggested an overly reactive dopamine reward system,
- [08:53] suggesting that the drive to act on an impulse to gain stimulation or short-term rewards
- [08:57] regardless of the consequences may be more intense than the average person's.
- [09:01] As we mentioned before, because personality disorders are pretty much egosyntonic by definition,
- [09:06] people don't often acknowledge that they have a problem or a need for treatment - and in
- [09:10] the case of Antisocial Personality Disorder, even if they did, there aren't many specific
- [09:14] treatments available, at least not for adults.
- [09:17] But there are some promising interventions for kids and adolescents whose minds and brains
- [09:21] are more plastic and adaptable. In this way, the best way to treat Antisocial Personality
- [09:25] Disorder may be in trying to prevent it. According to American psychiatrist Donald W. Black,
- [09:30] among others, many kids diagnosed with Conduct Disorder, the diagnostic precursor to Antisocial
- [09:35] Disorder, are at high-risk for developing Antisocial Personalities as adults. But by
- [09:40] identifying warning signs early on and by working with these kids and families to correct
- [09:44] their behavior and remove negative influences, some of that impulse fearlessness could be
- [09:49] channeled into healthier directions, like to reward promoting athleticism, or a spirit
- [09:53] of adventure. It's important to remember that Antisocial Personality Disorder is only one
- [09:56] type of personality disorder. This is a diverse family of psychological conditions determined
- [10:01] by many different factors and we're still in the early stages of diagnosing and understanding
- [10:06] the mechanisms behind them.
- [10:08] Today, you learned about personality disorders and the difference between ego-dystonic and
- [10:11] ego-syntonic disorders. We looked at the three clusters of personality disorder, according
- [10:15] to the DSM V, and how personality disorder symptoms often overlap. We also took a look
- [10:20] at Borderline and Antisocial Personality Disorders, including their potential bio-psycho-social roots.

Bernice has issues, and sure we all do, but hers are getting out of hand. At times she goes through bouts of depression that make it hard for her to even get out of bed. Sometimes she suffers from serious anxiety around things like test taking, flying, lots of things. All of which are brutalizing her self-worth and affecting her performance in work and life. She's ready to get professional help and, lucky for Bernice, she has a lot of options. Psychotherapy, perhaps the predominant type of psychological treatment, involves a therapist using a range of techniques to help a patient overcome troubles, gain insight, and achieve personal growth. Now you know by now that there are kinds of perspectives on the human mind and lots of

different philosophies on how to approach it. So it may not come as a surprise that there's also a variety of ways that experts analyze and treat ailments of the mind. They each create their own kind of experience for a person seeking help and to be honest some approaches are better suited for treating certain psychological conditions than others. But with Bernice as our guide we can see how each of these techniques works and maybe in the end we can get her out of bed, feeling more calm and confident, and back in the swing of things. He's back! If we're going to talk about psychotherapy, we've got to start with Freud, right? Psychotherapy, you will recall, is commonly grouped into four major schools or orientations. The psychodynamic,

existential-humanistic, behavioral, and cognitive therapies. Freud's famous lay on the couch and talk psychoanalysis is just one of several related therapies in the psychodynamic family and it was basically the first. In essence, Freud assumed that we didn't really know or at least fully understand ourselves or our motivations. So psychoanalysis served as a kind of historical reconstruction that helped patients access repressed feelings and memories and unconscious thoughts, by using free association and dream analysis with helpful interpretations from the therapist until they gained some self-insight. As you free associate, talk about your past and answer questions, your psychoanalyst picks up on sensitive subjects around which you appear to show resistance. Mental blocks that

keep you from your consciousness because they cause you anxiety. The psychoanalyst notes these resistances and offers interpretations of what might be going on to help promote insight. So if Bernice was visiting a psychoanalyst, talking about her day, the therapist might say "Tell me more about that dream with the birds with the broken wings." Or he might point out resistance, like, "I noticed that when you mentioned your fear of flying, you tend to bring up your childhood, but you never talk about your mother. Why might that be?" The therapist points out what may be unconscious themes to coax them into the light. Maybe Bernice needs to deal with a traumatic childhood memory or the fact that her mom ran away with a pilot or something to understand the roots of her fear.

Today, traditional psychoanalysis is less common. Critics have pointed out that psychoanalytic interpretations aren't easy to prove or disprove, which is a problem when you're trying to take the scientific approach. Plus, psychoanalysis tends to involve many sessions, sometimes 4 or 5 a week over a long period of time, and health insurance just won't cover that anymore. Therapists who have branched off from the psychoanalytic school fall into the psychodynamic family, which includes not just Freudian, theory, but also ideas from Karl Jung, Alfred Adler, Karen Horney, and others. The terms psychoanalytic and psychodynamic are often confused, but you can think of psychoanalysis as Freud's particular baby, while psychodynamic theory is really the family descended from

that baby. Similar to psychoanalysis, psychodynamic therapy focuses on helping people gain insight on the impact of unconscious internal forces, early relationships, and critical childhood experiences. But these therapies don't dwell on the id and the ego and superego or all the sex stuff, at least not like traditional psychoanalysis does. And not all psychologists are interested in rooting through your deep unconscious recesses like it was your underwear drawer. Some therapies focus more on conscious material and believe the present and future are worth more attention than the past. These include the existential-humanistic therapies, championed by Carl Rogers, Viktor Frankl, Fritz Perls, and others, who emphasized

people's inherent capacity for making rational choices, achieving self-acceptance, and attaining their maximum potential. Like the psychodynamic school, existential-humanistic therapy is still insight oriented, but it's much more about promoting growth rather than curing illness. Instead of calling folks patients, humanistic therapies refer to those they help as clients or just, ya know, people. In the mid 1900s, Rogers developed a humanistic technique called client-centered therapy. He encouraged therapists to help their client by providing an empathetic, genuine, and accepting environment and using active listening where the therapist echoes and clarifies what their clients are saying and feeling. Rogers believed these techniques helped to provide a safe,

non-judgmental place where clients could accept themselves, feel valued, and work towards self-actualization. But other therapists in this school brought in more somber topics. Perls, Frankl, and others incorporated the existentialist perspective, understanding anxiety and limits to personal growth is driven by the human impulse to deny the fact that, let's face it, we're all going to die. Sounds a little grim, but much like the existentialist philosophers, these theorists thought to maximize human potential and meaning in life in the face of those existential fears, helping people access their genuine selves. So let's say Bernice sees an existentialist-humanistic therapist and talks about her depression and

how it's keeping her from living a full life. By focusing on the present, this therapist might suggest that Bernice is afraid and avoidant of her true emotions, the bad and scary ones as well as the good ones, which is why she feels emotionally lifeless and drained. So her therapist might say, "Say more about the feelings that you're having right now, in this moment, as you talk about your depression." The therapist would listen without interpreting, at least at first, and help Bernice understand that she was being heard and accepted, which hopefully would give her comfort and strength to begin dealing with the tough emotions that she's been avoiding. Now if Bernice were to make her appointments with a behavior therapist, she'd experience

quite a different session. Behavior therapists argue that simply knowing that you're afraid of flying, for example, won't help you from freaking out at the thought of getting on a plane. Instead these therapists suggest that the problem behavior is the actual issue and the best way to get rid of unwanted automatic behavior is to replace it with more functional behavior through new learning and conditioning. In other words, behavior therapy aims to change behavior in order to change emotions and moods. Behavior therapy is rooted in the experiments of Ivan Pavlov and his classically conditioned dogs that drooled at the sound of a bell and work by E L Thorndike and B F Skinner on operant conditioning or changing behavior by using positive or negative reinforcement.

So say Bernice is seeing a behavior therapist because of an intense fear of flying. We know her fear is keeping her from personal and career goals like going to conferences and vacationing to Baja. But sometimes it even effects her ability to look up at a blue sky or flip through a travel magazine. Her therapist might use counter-conditioning to evoke new responses to the stimuli that trigger this unwanted behavior or she may use other behavior therapy methods like exposure, systematic desensitization, and aversive conditioning to help Bernice modify her reactions and behavior. So she doesn't dwell on having Bernice relive old memories or helping her self-actualize, she just wants to fix the problem behavior.

Aversive conditioning is less common and usually involves pairing an unpleasant stimulus with the targeted behavior. A classic example is giving someone with an alcohol problem a pill that makes them puke when they drink. Far more common and better studied, the exposure therapies treat an anxiety by having a person face their fears by exposing them to real or imagined situations that they typically avoid. Systematic desensitization is a type of exposure therapy that associates a relaxed state of mind with gradually increasing anxiety-inducing stimuli. Taking Bernice from, say, just thinking about flying, to looking at photos of planes in the air to sitting on a grounded plane, to eventually soaring in the skies for reals.

Behavior therapy works pretty well in treating specific fears and problems like phobias and it can also work for people with generalized anxiety disorder or major depression, but it often needs a boost. And we can get that boost from the cognitive therapies, the kind that teach people new, more adaptive ways of thinking. Cognitive therapy focuses more on what people think rather than what they do, assuming that if you can change a self-defeating thought, you can change the related behavior. This is the approach used by founding American cognitive therapist Aaron Beck. He and his colleagues pioneered the Socratic questioning method to help clients reverse destructive and catastrophic beliefs about themselves, the world, or the future at large, such as

everything that could possibly go wrong will go wrong. Say Bernice has a big test coming up, like a really big, all or nothing, end of the year exam. She's freaking out and her anxiety around the test already has her depressed, imagining that she'll fail. If she bombs the test, she fears that her dreams of getting into the graduate programs she wants will be dashed and her life will be over. Classic catastrophic thinking. A cognitive therapist would actively discuss all of this with her, challenging her thinking along the way and, in the end, help Bernice reexamine her assumptions about what's going to happen if she does fail like the world will not end and she will not utterly fail at life. Helping her work toward thinking more positive thoughts about herself and her future.

The cognitive therapist helps patients understand that changing what we say to ourselves is a very effective way to cope with our anxieties and modify our behavior. In other words, it really is the thought that counts. Not surprisingly, the cognitive and behavioral schools have joined forces frequently enough that cognitive-behavior therapies are typically considered a single school, and a lot of therapists use integrative approaches that try to use the best elements of all of these schools of thought. But all of these different psychotherapies don't always mean being alone with your therapist and your thoughts. Most of them can be done in groups, too. Group therapy fosters the therapeutic benefits you get from interacting with other people. Not only does it help with

the social aspects of mental health, but it also may remind clients that they're not alone. In a similar way, family therapy treats a family as a system, and views an individual's problem behaviors as being influenced by, or directed at, other family members. Family therapists work with multiple family members to heal relationships, improve insight and communication, and mobilize communal resources. So, the big question remains. Does psychotherapy work? You're going to have to wait until next time to find out because that is what we will be taking about, along with a look at the biomedical approach to therapy. For now, you've learned about the major types of psychotherapy. These include psychodynamic therapy and Freud's famous psychoanalysis, existential-humanist therapy and Roger's

client-centered focus, and behavior and cognitive therapies. We also took a quick look at group and family therapy.

### Transcript (reading)

If you saw our last lesson on psychotherapy you might be wondering: What happened to Bernice? Has she found a way to manage her depression? Is she still wracked with anxiety? Well it's really nice of you to ask. And I'll tell her you said, "hi." But for our purposes as students of psychology, the bigger question arising from Bernice's case is "has psychotherapy helped?" and just as important, "how can we tell?" Well believe it or not, one of the main ways experts use is to simply ask the client, and see how they say they're doing. Is Bernice out of bed, and living her life? Did she make it through mid-terms without spiraling into a crisis? And did she take that plane trip to Baja to party with her girls?

As a clinician, that would all be useful to know, right? But the key is that we want to ask these questions in a scientifically rigorous manner, so that we really know a treatment works, rather than just extrapolating from individual cases. And there's also a whole other category of treatment that's pretty different from the talking and listening that goes on in psychotherapy. These are as much medical intervention as they are psychological science; the biomedical treatments. These can be as common-place as medications like Zoloft or Lithium, or a bit more unusual and invasive like magnetic stimulation, neural implants, or even electroshock therapy. And YES, it's still a thing.

Healing a troublesome mind isn't like healing a broken arm. So one of the challenges that psychologists face is simply knowing whether they're doing their job, and doing it well. The methods psychologists use to assess how effective treatments are mostly involve client and clinician perceptions along with outcome research. Client perceptions are just what they sound like, you see a therapist, and someone asks you how you feel after your treatment. It varies by treatment, but client perception tends to be pretty rosy. One study found that 89% of folks said that they were at least "fairly well satisfied" with their treatment. But of course, perceptions are inherently subjective, and some believe that the therapeutic

relationship lends itself to a positive bias in client reviews. Basically, if you're sticking to your treatment, you probably like your therapist. Clinician perspectives can be similarly skewed, not only in terms of a self-serving bias, but also because they may not be around to see a client's future relapses or setbacks in mental health. A patient could see ten therapists over time, feel better at the end of each treatment, but keep struggling over the long term, even though each therapist thought the treatment was a success. So, can we objectively measure how well psychotherapy works? Well, we have treatment outcome research, a way of systematically measuring which therapies work best for which problems.

And the gold standard of treatment outcome research is the randomized clinical trial, or RCT. If you will remember your research methods, you'll know that RCTs generally require randomly selected and assigned participants, a control group, and at least one experimental group that receives the treatment. This design accounts for individual differences between people and other extraneous factors, so that we know that if people in the experimental group get better and people in the control group don't, it was truly the therapeutic intervention that made the difference. And once enough researchers have run their own RCTs, you can gather data via meta analysis, measuring results across multiple trials to see basically whether a treatment works, and

how well it does, across a variety of settings. Two important terms you should know here are effectiveness and efficacy. Effectiveness is whether or not a given therapy works in a "real-world setting," whereas efficacy is whether a therapy works better than some other, comparable intervention, or a control. Both terms matter, and you'll wanna get them straight, if you're tryin' to parse the research literature. Dozens of studies have confirmed that psychotherapy is both effective and efficacious. While controls, usually people who don't get any therapy, often do get better on their own, those in psychotherapy usually improve faster, and with a significantly lower risk of relapse.

However, and try not to look too shocked when I tell you this, there is a lot of argument about which therapies work best. In some cases, like phobias, there are clear winners, behavior therapy for instance. In others, like major depressive disorder, there are cognitive, behavioral and psychodynamic interventions that have all been successful in RCTs. And while a lot of psychologists seem to get a kick out of arguing about which therapies are better than others, there do seem to be some common factors that unite the more effective ones. A big one is simply instilling hope, helping demoralized clients regain hope that things can, and will get better. There is also the value of getting a new perspective, learning

that there is a plausible explanation for your troubles, and finding a new way of looking at yourself, the world around you, and what your future might look like. And across the board, any good therapist provides genuine empathy within a trusting, caring relationship. They seek to listen, and understand and not judge, and offer clear and positive communication. But psychotherapy, or talking it out, is just one way to treat psychological disorders. Quite often, biomedical therapies are an option, sometimes for the more severe disorders, but in many cases, in combination with psychotherapy. Biomedical therapies aim to physiologically change the brain's electrochemical state with psychotropic drugs, magnetic impulses, or

even electrical currents and surgery. As you might expect, pharmacotherapy is by far the most widely used, that's the one where you just take drugs. Psychotropic drugs are just any pharmaceutical that affects your mental state, the most commonly used ones fall into four major categories; antipsychotics, anxiolytics, antidepressants, and mood stabilizers, each aimed at a specific family of problems. Antipsychotics are used to treat schizophrenia and other types of severe thought disorders. Most of these medications alter the effects of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain by blocking its receptor sites, and blocking its uptake. This is based on the assumption that an overactive dopamine system contributes to schizophrenia, but, like many psychotropic

drugs, antipsychotics come with nasty side effects. Anxiolytics, or anti-anxiety meds, usually work by depressing activity in the central nervous system, much like a stiff drink might. For this reason, and others, it can be super dangerous to mix certain anxiety meds with booze. Also, letting your nerves mellow out can feel so good that patients may risk becoming addicted to some anxiolytics. Antidepressants are used to treat depression, as you might expect, but also a number of anxiety disorders. Each type is thought to work a bit differently, mainly by altering the availability of various neurotransmitters, like serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain, which in turn appears to help with mood and anxiety problems. Some of the most common

are selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, like Zoloft, Paxil, and Prozac, which partially block the normal re-uptake of serotonin. This makes it more available to the synapses, which, hypothetically at least, allows its mood-enhancing effects to kick in. Current research suggests that the use of antidepressant medication is most effective when combined with psychotherapy, which makes a lot of sense, and the same goes for a number of other psychological disorders. It's worth pointing out here that some meta-analyses suggest that antidepressants aren't any more effective than psychotherapy when symptoms are mild to moderate. One meta analysis that riled people up in recent years even suggested that antidepressants are no better than a

placebo in those cases. So psychotropic drugs can help, but sometimes you also need to start exploring the root causes of your issues and reevaluate how you deal with them, which is what psychotherapy is perfect for. Bernice, for example, probably would have benefited from both talk therapy and a dose of anxiolytic or antidepressant meds. The last big psychotropic drug group is the mood-stabilizers. They can be extremely effective in smoothing out the highs and lows of bipolar disorder. Simple salts of Lithium were the first of these drugs used, and they remain in widespread use today. Dr. Kay Redfield Jamison, who we talked about a few weeks ago has said that Lithium "prevents my disastrous highs, diminishes my depressions, gentles me out, keeps me from ruining my career and

relationships, keeps me out of a hospital, and alive." And while drugs are the most popular biomedical treatment, they aren't the only kind. For one, there's electro-shock therapy. Now, hear me out, this does carry a long history of negative connotations, like of people being strapped down and shocked into mental oblivion, but the technology has made a comeback, and can actually be quite effective in treating severe, treatment-resistant depression. It's properly called electroconvulsive therapy, or ECT, and it involves sending a brief electrical current through the brain of an anesthetized patient. This excites the neurons, causing them to fire rapidly, until the patient goes through a small, controlled seizure that lasts about two minutes. And we're not exactly sure

why this helps to relieve negative symptoms, but there are several theories that are being pursued. One suggests that the resulting seizure beneficially alters neurotransmitter activity in areas of the brain associated with moods and emotions, effectively jumpstarting a severely depressed brain. Another theory suggests that these electrical impulses modify stress hormone activity in the brain, which we know could play a role in sleep, energy, appetite, and mood. ECT may also re-activate previously dormant or suppressed neurons, or possibly stimulate the growth of new ones in key brain regions, helping the brain regain some level of lost functioning. There are a couple of other brain-stimulation treatments, too, that are more gentle. One

is repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, rTMS, which involves the painless application of repeated electromagnetic pulses. Another, deep-brain stimulation, DBS, is more invasive, and calls for surgically implanting a kind of "brain pacemaker" that sends out electrical impulses to specific parts of the brain. Despite all the new research and often positive results around rTMS and DBS, we're still sorting out how these treatments work to heal the brain and mind, but they're hypothesized to jump-start the neural circuitry in a depressed brain, similarly to ECT. So you'll notice that all these options come with certain risks, and really no treatment is entirely risk free, perhaps not even psychotherapy. But we should also note that some of the less

severe manifestations of psychological disorders may be improved with pretty simple lifestyle changes. Thirty to sixty minutes of daily aerobic exercise has been shown to be as effective as antidepressant medications in research on mild depression. Just remember those words; "daily" and "aerobic." Adequate sleep, social interaction, and good nutrition also all play a part in managing moods. In other words, general healthy living helps. There's an Old English proverb that says "different sores have different salves" and the same is true here. What works for one person may not work for another, and sometimes a few different kinds of intervention might be needed all at once.

Today you learned how client and clinician perceptions, outcome research, and meta-analytic reviews work together to determine the efficacy and effectiveness of psychological treatments. You also learned how biomedical therapies work, including the four major families of drug therapies, along with electro-convulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, and deep brain stimulation. And also how lifestyle changes and general healthy living can improve mental health.
