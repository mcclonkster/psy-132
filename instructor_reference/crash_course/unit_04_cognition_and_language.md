### Transcript (reading)

Why do smart people make dumb decisions? Why do conspiracy theorists think that we didn’t land on the moon or that Hillary Clinton is a space alien? And why won’t Bernice admit that the new Superman movie just isn’t very good? We’ve talked about cognition before. We usually refer to it as the process that we use to think and solve crossword puzzles and stuff. But really, cognition involves knowing, remembering, understanding, communicating, and to a certain extent, learning. And as truly wonderful as our brains are, we can be spectacularly bad at ALL of these things. We used to think our cognition worked like a computer -- logically processing information. But that cabbage-sized chunk of pink, wet brain matter in your skull can do a lot more

than math, and the things that it does are certainly not always logical. Many experts argue that it’s cognition that makes us truly human, and that everything that comes with it -- our preferences, prejudices, fears, and intuitions -- are what make us the individuals that we are. We’re not the only animals that show some evidence of cognition, of course: Chimps and gorillas exhibit insight and planning; crows use tools; elephants teach each other. But our capacity as humans to figure stuff out is matched only by our ability to totally misjudge stuff. As prone as we are to brilliance and insight, we’re equally likely to succumb to irrational thinking and false intuition. So, to borrow a riff from Rene Descartes, you think, therefore you are.

Which means you’re brilliant a lot of the time. And sometimes, you’re just going to look stupid. [INTRO] We all want to make sense of the world. And one of the major ways our cognition allows us do that is by forming concepts -- mental groupings of similar objects, people, ideas, or events. We like to lump things together. Concepts simplify our thinking in such a fundamental way that we usually don’t have to stop and think about using them, they’re just there. And yet without concepts, we’d need a unique name for everything. You couldn’t just ask me to shake the anglerfish -- because there’d be no concept of shake or fish, let alone stuffed, blue anglerfish. And if I told you I was devastated that I lost my anglerfish -- which I probably would

be -- I’d also have to explain my emotions, their intensities, even the words themselves that I had to use. So basically, without concepts, no one would ever get anything done. We’d all be like a bunch of ents taking all morning to say “Hey, what’s up?” We often organize our concepts by forming prototypes--mental images or pinnacle examples of a certain thing. For example, if I say “bird”--the general shape of a songbird probably pops into your head before like, a penguin or chicken or emu, because robins and cardinals more closely resemble our bird prototype. Still, if I show you a picture of some crazy creature you’ve never seen before, and you note that it has feathers and a beak, you’ll probably file it under the bird category because

it more closely resembles your concept of bird than your concept of rodent or overcoat or footstool. Concepts and prototypes speed up our thinking, but they also can box in our thinking, and lead to prejudice if we see something that doesn’t fit our prototypes. A hundred years ago the sight of a female doctor might have caused some heads to explode, because in peoples’ tiny minds, the prototypes of “doctor” and “woman” didn’t have any overlap. And actually some people today still feel that way. Haters gonna hate. So it’s important to actively keep your mind open mind to make room for evolving concepts, and remember that concepts may sometimes hurt as much as they help. One of the biggest ways our cognition works to our benefit, though, is through our ability to solve problems.

We use our problem-solving skills all the time: How to assemble Scandinavian furniture, bake muffins with a missing ingredient, or handle the crushing disappointment of the new Superman movie. And we approach problem-solving in different ways -- sometimes we value speed; other times, accuracy. Some problems we figure out using trial and error--you know, you try something and if it doesn’t work, try it a different way, and keep at it until something works. Trial and error is slow and deliberate--which may be good or bad, depending on the problem. We can also use algorithms and heuristics to come up with solutions. Algorithms are logical, methodical, step-by-step procedures that guarantee an eventual solution, though they may be slow to work through.

Heuristics, on the other hand, are more like mental shortcuts -- simple strategies that allow us to solve problems faster, although they’re more error-prone than algorithms. Say you’re at the store, looking for a family-sized bottle of Sriracha. You could use an algorithm and methodically check every shelf and aisle in the store. Or you could use heuristics and first search the Asian or condiment sections--the places that make the most sense based on what you already know. Heuristics may be way faster, but the algorithmic approach guarantees you won’t overlook the sauce along the way, because they stuck it in the deli or whatever dumb thing they did this week. So algorithms, heuristics, and trial-and-error are problem-solving strategies that involve a plan of attack.

But sometimes we get lucky while puzzling out a problem, and Aha!, out of nowhere a sudden flash of insight that solves our problem. I’ll use orange in the muffin recipe instead of lemon! Or, Sriracha lives in the Mexican section! For some reason! Neuroscientists have actually watched that kind of sudden, happy brain flash on neuroimaging screens. In one experiment, they gave subjects a problem to solve: What word can be added to the three words CRAB, PINE, and SAUCE to create a new compound word? Then they asked the subjects to press a button when they had the answer. While the subjects thought about it, scans showed activity in their frontal lobes, the areas involved in the focused attention of typical problem-solving.

But right at the Aha! moment, just as they pushed the button, there was a clear burst of activity just above the ear in the right temporal lobe, which, among many other things, is involved with recognition. The answer, by the way, we already gave you the hint earlier in the episode. Where’s my fish? Those sudden bursts of insight are awesome, but you can’t count on them to solve all your problems. And just because something feels, doesn’t mean it’s truly correct. Because as inventive and smartypants as we may be, our cognition often leads us astray in all kinds of ways. For instance, we often look for, and favor, evidence that verifies our ideas, while we’re more likely to avoid or ignore contradictory evidence -- a tendency known as confirmation bias.

This is really similar to the overconfidence we’ve talked about, when you’re basically more confident than you are correct. When this kind of cognitive bias takes hold, you might cling to your initial conceptions in a kind of belief perseverance, even in the face of clear proof to the contrary. This happens all the time, and it can be maddening for people watching it happen. People still think that the earth is flat! It’s like...WHAT? HOW? There’s space pictures! I probably don’t need to tell you -- people can really get weird and defensive when they evade facts and choose to see only the information that confirms their beliefs. They may even become functionally fixed, unable to view a problem from a new perspective.

Instead they just keep approaching a situation with the same mental set, especially if it’s worked in the past. Say you’ve got a nail sticking out from a board, and you’re like “I need to take care of that!” There’s rocks, and bricks all around you. But because of your functional fixedness on the idea that only hammers work on nails, you don’t even consider hitting it with the brick, and instead you waste a bunch of time in the garage looking for a hammer, and you’re angry and frustrated, and there’s still a nail sticking up from the board. So, our mental set predisposes how we think, just as you’ll remember that our perceptual set predisposes how we perceive. This is what makes heuristics -- those super-convenient mental shortcuts that we all use -- so easily fallible.

In the 1970s, cognitive psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman researched how we make snap judgments, and discovered one way smart people make dumb decisions. They found that people believe an event will be more likely to occur if they can conjure up examples or memories of it, especially if those examples are particularly vivid, scary, or awesome. So, say you’re in a casino and you win two dollars at a slot machine. Suddenly every flashing light and ringing bell in the place goes off. But when you lose -- which is the vast majority of the time -- it’s just...crickets. With all their lights and noise-making, the casino makes sure that wins are super vivid and memorable, while losses just go away unacknowledged.

That way, the next time you’re standing there with 100 bucks in your pocket, you’re more likely to overestimate your chances of winning, because the memories of winning are more striking. The more mentally available those memories are, the more it seems that it’s going to happen again. This is known as the availability heuristic. And it can warp our judgements of people, too. If we keep remembering news footage that shows people of a given group shooting guns, that can shape our impression of the entire group -- even if what we saw was only a tiny minority within that group. Essentially, we are great at fearing the wrong things. We worry about being killed in a plane crash or getting bitten in half by a shark or accidentally choking on a dumpling.

Thanks to our brain’s b-roll of horrific images, we come to fear what’s actually very rare, instead of worrying about much more common, but less memorable ends like car accidents, cancer, and heart failure. Our thinking can also be swayed by framing, or how an issue is presented. Imagine you’re considering climbing Everest or getting a nose job or eating a bowl of raw blowfish. I can frame the risks in different ways. Telling you that you’ve got a 95 percent chance of survival sounds a lot different than saying five out of a hundred people die doing this activity, though the information is the same. Our cognitive minds are capable of incredible intellectual feats and tremendous failures.

We can solve problems better than any organism on the planet, but given the chance, we can also mess up a pretty simple judgment every day of the week. But if we’re mindful of our capacity for error -- and if we honor our ingenuity and intellect -- I think our ability to solve any problem is nearly infinite. And that, gives me a lot of hope. Seriously though where is my fish? Today you learned how we use concepts, prototypes, and our mental sets to think and communicate, and how algorithms, heuristics, and insight help us solve problems. You also learned about how fixation, the availability heuristic, fear, overconfidence, and belief perseverance can get in the way of good decision-making and thinking.

### Transcript (reading)

In your lifetime, you have probably stared down any number of ability tests and course exams and PSATs, SATs, ACTs, GREs, GCSEs, whatever you got in your country. Humans, it seems, really get a thrill out of measuring, ranking, and comparing each other's intelligence. Unfortunately, as you saw last week, historically, we have been kind of bad at that. Today, we think of intelligence as determined by a series of factors related to genetics, environment, education, perhaps even randomness itself, some aspects of which may correlate with belonging to a particular social group, and others not. The key here, though, is that we don't fully understand how or how much some of these factors work.

How do elements like personal history and conditions like poverty, access to education, stress, even nutrition affect someone's scores on cognitive tests? And if a group of people share some of these conditions, how will they respond--both as individuals and as a group--to certain potentially biased intelligence tests? In the end, the irony is that in our ongoing effort to measure human intelligence, most of what we've learned is simply what we don't know. [Intro] What is a piano? Which one of these things is least like the others? Juice is to glass as hand is to what? Which one of these numbers does not belong in the series? Bernice had x number of jelly beans. She ate one, then gave half of what was left to Bruno, then she ate another and gave half of the remainder to her dog.

Now, she only has five beans. How many did she--ahheh uhhhh. These questions are similar to what you'd find on today's most widely-used intelligence tests. The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, or WAIS, and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, or WISC. Originally published by psychologist David Wechsler in 1955, the current edition of the exam consists of fifteen different sub-tests that assess things like vocabulary, similarities between objects and concepts, and patterns in letters and numbers. Cognitive tests usually fall into one of two categories: achievement, or the kind that reflect what you've learned, and aptitude - the kind that's supposed to predict your ability to learn something new.

So the WAIS and the WISC are aptitude tests, and your final exam at the end of your math class is an achievement test. So, how do we know if an intelligence test, or any other test for that matter, is actually any good? Well, today, we do have some standards. To be widely accepted, a test must hit three important marks. It has to be standardized, reliable, and valid. Standardization is basically about comparability. Whether you answer 15 or 50 questions correctly on a test actually means very little until you can compare those scores against how others performed. So, to achieve meaningful comparisons, test-makers must first give the test to a representative sample group, which sets a standard by which to compare future test-takers.

You've probably heard of a bell-curve. Whether you're measuring height or mental aptitude or love of the Beatles, it's often assumed that everyone you're measuring will fall into what's called a normal pattern: most scores will fall in the mid-range, while fewer hit the extremes. And actually, it's those extremes that intelligence tests are most widely and effectively used for. It might help an educator identify a gifted student who totally blows the roof off a test, but they're also useful in helping clinicians determine who might have a disability or be facing some specific barrier. With victims of traumatic brain injury or stroke, for example, a WAIS test can do a nice job of sussing out whether a patient who's struggling with language actually has

a problem remembering and identifying words, or if they're just having a hard time processing the information quickly. But these tests should be regarded more skeptically when it comes to issues that are either way more specific or way more broad. Like, they won't be able to answer questions along the lines of, "Will Jesse get into Harvard?" or "Are women smarter than men?" They're just not designed to do that. And in any case, simply knowing where you fall on a normal curve on a standardized test doesn't mean much if the test is poorly designed, so along with being standardized, a good test has high reliability, meaning it yields dependably consistent results. One way to determine this is to have people take the same test a second time, or some similar version of it.

If the two performances resemble one another -- if the scores correlate -- then the test is thought to have good reliability. And the third requirement for the testing trifecta is simply validity, or the extent to which a test measures or predicts what it's supposed to. And there are different kinds of validity -- for instance, if I take the WAIS IQ test and my scores accurately predict how good my grades in college will be, that's a simple kind of predictive or criterion validity. On the other hand, if I take the test and my scores correlate strongly with my results on another similar cognitive test, like the Stanford Binet, that falls under the broad category of construct validity.

The key is that all of these are ways to see if a test measures what it claims to measure. But the stickiest wicket of them all is what we make of the test scores themselves. We've all heard plenty about the influence of both nature and nurture in psychology, so the big question is: do our genetics influence our intelligence, or does our environment? And this is an easy question to answer because they both do. And that is important. If the history of intelligence testing has taught us anything, it's that assuming everyone is smart in the same way and for the same reason can lead to disastrously bad conclusions. So let's look at the scientific evidence, and the best place for that is the wealth of twin and adoption studies, which have been fascinatingly helpful in illustrating how

genetics and environment can both influence intelligence. For example, research has shown that identical twins who were raised together have the highest rate of similarity in intelligence scores of any group. Fraternal twins who share only half the genes tend to be much less similar in their scores, even when raised in the same home. Likewise, neuroimaging studies show that certain brain regions, like those associated with language, are structurally similar between identical twins, and show similar activity while doing the same kinds of mental tasks. The brains of fraternal twins raised in the same home are very similar in some areas, but less so in others. But identical twins who are raised together have the same brain, at least, according to neuroimaging scans.

Some studies even showed that identical twins raised apart from each other show higher intelligence correlation than fraternal twins raised together. And maybe even more interesting is that these intelligence correlations actually increase over time. In one mega-study of eleven thousand twin pairs in four countries, that correlation kept increasing from middle-childhood to adolescence to young adulthood and continued to increase through adulthood. Similar research has looked at adopted children and compared their scores with those of their adopted siblings, parents, and biological parents. And the results can be kind of surprising, because as adopted kids grow up, their mental similarities to their adoptive families actually get smaller over time until there's virtually

no correlation by adulthood. Instead, they become more similar in terms of mental aptitude to their biological parents over time, even if they never met. In other words: genes appear to matter. You could take a hundred kids and raise them in the exact same way, and as adults, they'd still have different aptitudes. But, does this mean that when it comes to intelligence, we're all nature and no nurture? Well, luckily, and somewhat obviously, no. Life experiences and environment also matter. One sad example of how early environments affect children can be found in the work of American psychologist J. McVicker Hunt in a destitute Iranian orphanage in the 1970s. Conditions were really, really bad; infants received minimal care, and whatever attention

they did get was on a routine schedule, never in response to whether they were cooing or crying or anything else. Basically, they were being raised with no cause and effect between their behaviors and the responses of their caregivers, and as a result, they didn't learn how to communicate. With no stimulation or social response, the kids were just kind of passive, vacant lumps. Deprivation was essentially trumping any inborn intelligence. So, Hunt started a program. He trained caregivers to actually talk to infants, to teach them how to mimic sounds and actions, and eventually, sounds and words from their language. The results were tremendous. The kids started to learn really quickly, and basically just came alive.

While it's an extreme example, Hunt's research showed how malleable early childhood intelligence can be, especially in disadvantaged and stressful conditions. So you can see that environment and heredity interact to affect intelligence, and that some tricky implications can come out of that conclusion. But that's hardly the only controversy when it comes to how we view and measure intelligence. There have been some sensational headline-courting studies of genetic and social influences that have suggested that fundamental differences in intelligence may exist between genders and races, but many of these studies are tangled up in questions of how potential testing bias may affect performance.

Basically, if a test inadvertently measures differences caused by cultural experiences or social factors instead of what we might call "innate intelligence", then you might say that the test is biased. Extreme example: in the past, immigrants to the US were classified as "feeble minded" if they couldn't answer distinctly American questions, like "Who was the first American president?" or "What's a milkshake?". Today, concerns about bias focuses on differences among members of the same general culture. Say, a poor, rural kid who might be plenty smart, but will test low if questions involve urban, upper-class concepts like taking taxis and drinking tea out of china cups or the rules of tennis.

So the questions themselves can skew performance results, but who administers the test can also affect outcomes. Women tend to do better with a fellow female administrator, and African Americans often score higher if their test is given by an African American instructor. And the risk of bias may even fall to the test-takers' own expectations. For example, many studies have found that if you give a math test to equally capable men and women, but just before starting, you tell the subjects that women usually score lower than men, you actually negatively affect the women's performance. This self-fulfilling concern that you might mess up and inadvertently fulfill some negative stereotype is called stereotype threat.

It was first described by social psychologist Claude Steele and Joshua Aronson, and it's been demonstrated frequently across a whole host of interesting studies. Now, we've only scratched the surface of this mess that is intelligence testing. An important thing to remember next time you ace or bomb a test is that you are far more complicated and nuanced than any test score. Don't let a number puff you up or drag you down, and don't let it define you. We all have room for self-improvement. We are all full of infinite surprising potential. Ah, and answers to the questions I asked earlier: A piano is a musical instrument played using a keyboard, banana is the least similar to the others, juice is to class as hand is to

glove, the number two does not belong in the series, and Bernice began with twenty-three jellybeans. Today, your intelligent mind learned how we currently use WAIS and WISC tests to measure intelligence, and how important it is that a test be standardized, reliable, and valid. We also looked at how genetics, environment, testing bias, and stereotype threat can affect IQ test performance.

### Transcript (navigation)

- [00:00] In your lifetime, you have probably stared down any number of ability tests and course
- [00:04] exams and PSATs, SATs, ACTs, GREs, GCSEs, whatever you got in your country.
- [00:09] Humans, it seems, really get a thrill out of measuring, ranking, and comparing each
- [00:13] other's intelligence.
- [00:15] Unfortunately, as you saw last week, historically, we have been kind of bad at that.
- [00:18] Today, we think of intelligence as determined by a series of factors related to genetics,
- [00:24] environment, education, perhaps even randomness itself, some aspects of which may correlate
- [00:28] with belonging to a particular social group, and others not.
- [00:31] The key here, though, is that we don't fully understand how or how much some of these factors
- [00:36] work.
- [00:37] How do elements like personal history and conditions like poverty, access to education,
- [00:40] stress, even nutrition affect someone's scores on cognitive tests?
- [00:44] And if a group of people share some of these conditions, how will they respond--both as
- [00:48] individuals and as a group--to certain potentially biased intelligence tests?
- [00:52] In the end, the irony is that in our ongoing effort to measure human intelligence, most
- [00:57] of what we've learned is simply what we don't know.
- [01:05] [Intro]
- [01:10] What is a piano?
- [01:12] Which one of these things is least like the others?
- [01:15] Juice is to glass as hand is to what?
- [01:17] Which one of these numbers does not belong in the series?
- [01:19] Bernice had x number of jelly beans.
- [01:20] She ate one, then gave half of what was left to Bruno, then she ate another and gave half
- [01:25] of the remainder to her dog.
- [01:26] Now, she only has five beans.
- [01:27] How many did she--ahheh uhhhh.
- [01:29] These questions are similar to what you'd find on today's most widely-used intelligence
- [01:33] tests.
- [01:34] The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, or WAIS, and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale
- [01:38] for Children, or WISC.
- [01:40] Originally published by psychologist David Wechsler in 1955, the current edition of the

Smarty pants, egg head, brainiac. You've heard terms like these before, maybe you've even been on the receiving end of one of them. But actually, defining intelligence is a lot trickier than just coming up with new names for smart people. I mean, intelligence isn't like height or weight; you can't just toss them on a scale and give it an exact measurement. It has different meanings for different cultures and ages and skill sets. So what is intelligence? It's a question that doesn't give us a lot of answers, but it does open a bunch of other equally important and interesting questions. Like, what influences it? And how can it be assessed? Is it a single, general ability, or does it cover a range of aptitudes and skills and talents?

How do things like creativity and innovation factor in? Or genetics or environment, or education? And what about emotional intelligence? Most agree that it's best to think of intelligence not of a concrete thing so much as a concept, the ability to learn from experience, solve problems, and use knowledge to adapt to new experiences. We've often used intelligence tests, to assess and compare mental aptitude, but these tests have a long, complex and dark history. I mean there are Nazis involved so, yeah. So as you'll see, there are reasons that intelligence is one of the most hotly debated subjects in psychology. It's complicated and controversial. [Intro] What if I'm the world's greatest Rubik's cube solver but a terrible speller?

Or a truly gifted artist who's barely mastered long division? Could anyone say I was intelligent or not based on those different aptitudes, or would it be more accurate to measure my brainpower on several different scales? Around the turn of the twentieth century, British psychologist Charles Spearman suggested that yes, we do have one comprehensive general intelligence that underlies all of specific mental abilities. He called it the G-Factor. Spearman conceded that while people may have special talents like basket weaving or saxophone solos or doing crossword puzzles, those things still fell under "G". And he helped develop a statistical procedure called factor analysis to try to determine how certain clusters of skills might correlate with another one.

Like, say someone who tests well in spatial skills might be good with numbers. We might then refer to that cluster of skills, that factor, as spatial-numeric reasoning. But to Spearman, the G-factor was something of an uber-factor connected to all intelligent behavior from architecture to healing to survival skills, and it's why people who do well on one kind of cognitive test tend to do well on others. But as you can imagine, reducing intelligence to a single numerical test score was and is problematic. L.L. Thurstone, an American pioneer of psychometrics and one of Spearman's first challengers, was not into ranking people on a single scale. Thurstone administered 56 different tests to his subjects then used them to identify seven clusters of mental abilities.

By this system, you might turn out to be great at like verbal comprehension but less stellar at something like numerical ability. Sounds fair. But when researchers followed up on his findings, they actually did see that high scores in one aptitude usually meant good scores in the others, essentially backing up some evidence for some kind of G-factor. Even though their ideas did not often align, Spearman and Thurstone together paved the way for more contemporary theories on intelligence. For example, American psychologist Howard Gardner views intelligence as multiple abilities that come in different forms. He references instances of brain damage where one ability may be destroyed while others stay perfectly intact.

Savants usually have some limited metal abilities but one exceptional ability when it comes to like, computing figures or memorizing the complete works of Shakespeare. To Gardner, this suggests that we have multiple intelligences beyond the G-factor. In fact, he believes that we have eight intelligences, ranging from our skills with numbers and words to our ability to understand physical space and the natural world. American psychologist Robert Sternberg tends to agree with Gardner, though he boils them down into three intelligences: analytical, or problem-solving intelligence, creative intelligence, or the ability to adapt to new situations, and practical intelligence for everyday tasks.

Both of these models seem reasonable, too, and Gardner and Sternberg's work has helped teachers appreciate students' variety of talents. But research has suggested that even these different ways to be smart are also linked by some underlying general intelligence factor. So what about other less tangible forms of intelligence, like creativity, our ability to produce ideas that are both novel and valuable? How can a test that demands one correct answer account for more creative solutions, so-called "divergent thinking". Well, traditional intelligence tests can't, and so far, while we do have some tests that look at creative potential, we don't have a standardized system for quantifying creativity.

But Sternberg and his colleagues have identified five main components of creativity, which are useful for framing our understanding of what creative intelligence is and how it works. If you go through the list, you know who I think is really great at almost all of them? Sherlock Holmes. Hear me out. First we've got expertise, or a well-developed base of knowledge. This just means knowing a lot about a lot. Whether it's arcane poisons, jellyfish behavior, or how to recognize a secret passage behind a book shelf, expertise provides the mind with all sorts of data to work with and combine in new ways. Obviously Sherlock has incredible imaginative thinking skills, too, which provide him with the ability to see things in new ways, recognize patterns and make connections.

He loves nothing more than rehashing these breadcrumb trails for the dopey constables at the end of the case. Sternberg also thought a venturesome personality contributes to creativity. By hanging around opium dens and chasing thugs and generally courting danger, Sherlock routinely seeks new experiences, tolerates risk, and perseveres in overcoming obstacles. And everyone knows he's driven by intrinsic motivation. I mean, he wants to help the widow discover the thief and everything, but really, Sherlock is driven by his own interest and sense of challenge. He gets pleasure from the work itself. And finally, Sherlock benefits from a creative environment which sparks, supports, and refines his ideas.

For so affectionately maintaining this environment on Sherlock's behalf, we largely have Dr. Watson to thank. Sherlock was obviously an academic and creative genius, but he was pretty weak in another form of intelligence: the emotional kind. Emotional intelligence, defined in 1997 by psychologist Peter Salovey and John Mayer -- no, not, not that one-- is the ability to perceive, understand, manage, and use emotions. I don't know about you, but I know plenty of smart people who have a hard time processing social information. The most brilliant mathematician may struggle to communicate with colleagues, neighbors, or staff at the local deli. Likewise, Sherlock often annoys, offends, or even baffles those around him.

Perceiving emotions means being able to recognize them in faces, and even in music, film, and stories. Understanding emotions relates to being able to predict them and how they might change. And managing emotions comes down to knowing how to appropriately express yourself in various situations. And finally, emotional intelligence also means using emotions to enable adaptive or creative thinking; like knowing how to manage conflict or comfort a grieving friend or work well with others. Much like creative intelligence, emotional intelligence can be measured to some degree through testing, but there's no standardized way to, like, assign a numerical value. So if we can't perfectly quantify things like creativity or emotional smarts, how did we come up with a way to measure intelligence?

Well, as I mentioned earlier, it's a sordid story. The first attempts to do it in the western world began with English scientist Francis Galton in the 1800s. Taking a page from his famous cousin Charles Darwin's theories on natural selection, Galton wondered how that premise might extend to humans' natural ability when it came to intelligence. He suggested that our smarts have a lot to do with heredity, so if we encouraged smart people to breed with each other, we could essentially create a master race of geniuses. If that sounds a little sketchy, it's because it was, like, really, really sketchy!! This study of how to selectively and supposedly improve the human population, especially by encouraging breeding in some people and discouraging it in others, is called "eugenics".

A term Galton himself coined, and I'll get back to, in a minute. But around the turn of the twentieth century when eugenics was taking off, the French government mandated that all children must attend school. Many of these kids had never been in a classroom and teachers wanted to figure out how they could identify kids who needed extra help. Enter Alfred Binet and Theodore Simon, two French psychologists who were commissioned to develop a test to measure a child's so-called mental age. The concept of a kid's mental age is essentially the level of performance associated with a certain chronological age. So if six year old Bruno tests as well as the average six year old, he'd have a mental age of six.

Binet believed that his tests could measure a child's current mental abilities, but that intelligence wasn't a fixed, inborn thing. He believed a person's capabilities could be raised with proper attention, self-discipline and practice. In other words, he was no eugenicist. He was hoping that his tests would improve children's education by identifying those who needed extra attention. But Binet also feared that these tests would, in the wrong hands, be used to do just the opposite: labeling children as "lost causes", limiting their opportunities. And wow, was he on to something because that is pretty much exactly what happened. German psychologist William Stern used revisions of Binet and Simon's work to create the famous intelligence quotient, or IQ measurement.

At the time, your IQ was simply your mental age, divided by your chronological age, multiplied by a hundred. So for example Bruno is six, and so is his mental age, so his IQ ranks at a hundred, but his little sister Betty is a four year-old with a mental age of five, so her IQ would be 125. That formula works pretty well for measuring kids, but it falls apart when it comes to adults who don't hit measurable developmental steps like kids do. I mean there's no real difference between a mental age of 34 and 35. But Stanford professor Lewis Terman started promoting the widespread use of intelligence tests in the early 1900s, and with his help the US government began the world's first massive ministration of intelligence tests, when it assessed World War I army recruits

and immigrants fresh off the boat. Unlike Binet, Terman did use these numerical findings as a kind of label, and he thought his tests could, as he put it: "ultimately result in curtailing the reproduction of feeble-mindedness". This kind of testing played right into eugenicists' sensibilities, and soon the eugenics movement in the US had a pretty good fanclub, raising money from the Carnegie's and Rockafeller's and with proponents working at Harvard and Columbia and Cornell. In the first half of the 21st century, intelligence tests were used to enforce the sterilization of about 60,000 people, around a third of whom were in California. Most were poor white women, often unwed mothers or prostitutes.

Other eugenics efforts persisted later into the century, and there is evidence of poor African American, Native American, or Latina women being forcibly or covertly sterilized in large numbers as recently as the 1970s. But do you know who really loved their eugenics? The Nazis. Hitler and his cronies took the idea of intelligence testing to even darker conclusions. The Nazis were all about selecting against so-called "feeble-mindedness" and other undesirable traits as they sought to strengthen what they saw as their Aryan nation. They sterilized or simply executed hundreds of thousands of victims based of their answers to IQ test questions that were really more abut adhering to social norms than measuring actual intelligence.

Questions like: "Who was Bismarck?" and "What does Christmas signify?" So you can see how this terrifying history still makes some people leery of how such tests are administered, interpreted, and weighted. Today we understand that intelligence, as defined by all the people we've talked about here, does appear to be a real and measurable phenomenon. But no one can say that they've disentangled all of the would-be genetic, environmental, educational, and socio-economic components of it. In the end, it's best to think of intelligence as something about which we've still got a lot to learn. And next week, we'll talk about how we test intelligence today and the problems we still face in doing it.

Today, your intelligent mind learned about the history of how we think about and define different types of intelligence, what the G-factor is, and how Sherlock Holmes is incredibly intelligent but emotionally unintelligent. You also learned about the history and methods of intelligence testing, IQ scores, and how eugenics turned to the dark side, and has since made even talking about intelligence kind of controversial.

- [00:01] Smarty pants, egg head, brainiac.
- [00:04] You've heard terms like these before, maybe you've even been on the receiving end of one
- [00:08] of them.
- [00:09] But actually, defining intelligence is a lot trickier than just coming up with new names
- [00:13] for smart people.
- [00:14] I mean, intelligence isn't like height or weight; you can't just toss them on a scale
- [00:17] and give it an exact measurement.
- [00:18] It has different meanings for different cultures and ages and skill sets.
- [00:22] So what is intelligence?
- [00:23] It's a question that doesn't give us a lot of answers, but it does open a bunch of other
- [00:28] equally important and interesting questions.
- [00:31] Like, what influences it?
- [00:32] And how can it be assessed?
- [00:34] Is it a single, general ability, or does it cover a range of aptitudes and skills and
- [00:38] talents?
- [00:39] How do things like creativity and innovation factor in?
- [00:41] Or genetics or environment, or education?
- [00:43] And what about emotional intelligence?
- [00:45] Most agree that it's best to think of intelligence not of a concrete thing so much as a concept,
- [00:50] the ability to learn from experience, solve problems, and use knowledge to adapt to new
- [00:54] experiences.
- [00:55] We've often used intelligence tests, to assess and compare mental aptitude, but these tests
- [00:59] have a long, complex and dark history.
- [01:02] I mean there are Nazis involved so, yeah.
- [01:05] So as you'll see, there are reasons that intelligence is one of the most hotly debated subjects
- [01:09] in psychology.
- [01:10] It's complicated and controversial.
- [01:17] [Intro]
- [01:23] What if I'm the world's greatest Rubik's cube solver but a terrible speller?
- [01:26] Or a truly gifted artist who's barely mastered long division?
- [01:30] Could anyone say I was intelligent or not based on those different aptitudes, or would
- [01:34] it be more accurate to measure my brainpower on several different scales?
- [01:37] Around the turn of the twentieth century, British psychologist Charles Spearman suggested
- [01:41] that yes, we do have one comprehensive general intelligence that underlies all of specific
- [01:46] mental abilities.
- [01:47] He called it the G-Factor.
- [01:49] Spearman conceded that while people may have special talents like basket weaving or saxophone
- [01:53] solos or doing crossword puzzles, those things still fell under "G".
- [01:58] And he helped develop a statistical procedure called factor analysis to try to determine
- [02:02] how certain clusters of skills might correlate with another one.
- [02:05] Like, say someone who tests well in spatial skills might be good with numbers.
- [02:09] We might then refer to that cluster of skills, that factor, as spatial-numeric reasoning.
- [02:14] But to Spearman, the G-factor was something of an uber-factor connected to all intelligent
- [02:19] behavior from architecture to healing to survival skills, and it's why people who do well on
- [02:24] one kind of cognitive test tend to do well on others.
- [02:27] But as you can imagine, reducing intelligence to a single numerical test score was and is
- [02:33] problematic.
- [02:34] L.L.
- [02:35] Thurstone, an American pioneer of psychometrics and one of Spearman's first challengers, was
- [02:39] not into ranking people on a single scale.
- [02:41] Thurstone administered 56 different tests to his subjects then used them to identify
- [02:46] seven clusters of mental abilities.
- [02:48] By this system, you might turn out to be great at like verbal comprehension but less stellar
- [02:53] at something like numerical ability.
- [02:54] Sounds fair.
- [02:55] But when researchers followed up on his findings, they actually did see that high scores in
- [02:58] one aptitude usually meant good scores in the others, essentially backing up some evidence
- [03:03] for some kind of G-factor.
- [03:05] Even though their ideas did not often align, Spearman and Thurstone together paved the
- [03:09] way for more contemporary theories on intelligence.
- [03:12] For example, American psychologist Howard Gardner views intelligence as multiple abilities
- [03:16] that come in different forms.
- [03:17] He references instances of brain damage where one ability may be destroyed while others
- [03:21] stay perfectly intact.
- [03:23] Savants usually have some limited metal abilities but one exceptional ability when it comes
- [03:27] to like, computing figures or memorizing the complete works of Shakespeare.
- [03:30] To Gardner, this suggests that we have multiple intelligences beyond the G-factor.
- [03:34] In fact, he believes that we have eight intelligences, ranging from our skills with numbers and words
- [03:40] to our ability to understand physical space and the natural world.
- [03:43] American psychologist Robert Sternberg tends to agree with Gardner, though he boils them
- [03:47] down into three intelligences: analytical, or problem-solving intelligence, creative
- [03:52] intelligence, or the ability to adapt to new situations, and practical intelligence for
- [03:57] everyday tasks.
- [03:58] Both of these models seem reasonable, too, and Gardner and Sternberg's work has helped
- [04:02] teachers appreciate students' variety of talents.
- [04:05] But research has suggested that even these different ways to be smart are also linked
- [04:09] by some underlying general intelligence factor.
- [04:12] So what about other less tangible forms of intelligence, like creativity, our ability
- [04:16] to produce ideas that are both novel and valuable?
- [04:20] How can a test that demands one correct answer account for more creative solutions, so-called
- [04:24] "divergent thinking".
- [04:25] Well, traditional intelligence tests can't, and so far, while we do have some tests that
- [04:30] look at creative potential, we don't have a standardized system for quantifying creativity.
- [04:35] But Sternberg and his colleagues have identified five main components of creativity, which
- [04:40] are useful for framing our understanding of what creative intelligence is and how it works.
- [04:45] If you go through the list, you know who I think is really great at almost all of them?
- [04:49] Sherlock Holmes.
- [04:50] Hear me out.
- [04:51] First we've got expertise, or a well-developed base of knowledge.
- [04:54] This just means knowing a lot about a lot.
- [04:56] Whether it's arcane poisons, jellyfish behavior, or how to recognize a secret passage behind
- [05:01] a book shelf, expertise provides the mind with all sorts of data to work with and combine
- [05:06] in new ways.
- [05:07] Obviously Sherlock has incredible imaginative thinking skills, too, which provide him with
- [05:11] the ability to see things in new ways, recognize patterns and make connections.
- [05:16] He loves nothing more than rehashing these breadcrumb trails for the dopey constables
- [05:20] at the end of the case.
- [05:21] Sternberg also thought a venturesome personality contributes to creativity.
- [05:24] By hanging around opium dens and chasing thugs and generally courting danger, Sherlock routinely
- [05:30] seeks new experiences, tolerates risk, and perseveres in overcoming obstacles.
- [05:34] And everyone knows he's driven by intrinsic motivation.
- [05:37] I mean, he wants to help the widow discover the thief and everything, but really, Sherlock
- [05:41] is driven by his own interest and sense of challenge.
- [05:45] He gets pleasure from the work itself.
- [05:47] And finally, Sherlock benefits from a creative environment which sparks, supports, and refines
- [05:52] his ideas.
- [05:53] For so affectionately maintaining this environment on Sherlock's behalf, we largely have Dr.

### Transcript (reading)

Baby Kanzi was recently adopted and adjusting to life in his new home. His mother was working with a language coach to learn some English, and Kanzi usually came along, though he didn't appear to pay much attention. But the language coach noticed that he seemed to be picking up on how to communicate just by watching his mother's lessons. Oddly enough, it appeared that he was picking things up faster than his mom. For example, the phrases, "You tickle" and "tickle you" meant two different things. And Kanzi's mom, she was having a hard time understanding that syntax. One day, Kanzi was hanging out, playing with stuffed animals, and the coach asked him to make the dog bite the snake. Kanzi put the snake into the dog's mouth

like it was no big deal. It was a really big deal, because Kanzi is a bonobo. He's actually a language superstar. Even among the elite research primates, like Koko the gorilla, Kanzi was the first ape to demonstrate that language can be acquired spontaneously through observation, without planned training, and the first to show a rudimentary understanding of grammar, syntax, and semantics. Again, really big deal! Especially because for years, humans have been proclaiming that it's language that sets us apart from other animals. But are we really alone? Turns out, that question keeps getting more and more complicated. Technically, we define language as a set of spoken, written, or signed words, and the way

we combine them to communicate meaning. If we change that definition to include the use of complex grammar, then maybe we are alone. But if language is simply the ability to communicate through a meaningful sequence of symbols, as I might do while looking for a bathroom in Sweden, or Kanzi does when she's asking for roast marshmallows, well then welcome to the club, apes! [INTRO MUSIC] We communicate in part by engaging our brains and bodies to make sounds that let us transfer thoughts from our brain to other people's brains. But of course, language is more than just making air vibrate with sound. I can communicate by moving my hands, which you might have noticed I do pretty frequently, or by using visual symbols.

All of these forms of language allow us to comprehend things we've never actually witnessed, and exchange information with each other quickly and effectively to, y'know, get a job, or be a friend, or use a metaphor. It's hard to imagine a fulfilling life without some kind of language. Humans have nearly 7,000 different languages and no matter how different they sound, we can break down their basic structure in the same way, using the same three building blocks. The smallest of them are phonemes. These are very short, distinctive sound units like "a," "t," "ch," "sh," like, stuff like that. English uses about 40 of them. Phonemes go together to make morphemes, which are the smallest units that carry meaning. This can be words or parts of words, like a prefix

or a suffix for example. The word "speech" is a morpheme that contains four phoneme sound units: "s," "p," "ee," "ch." From there, you arrange morphemes into your language's grammar or system of rules, allowing you to say the things that you want to say. So those 40 English phonemes give us over 100,000 morphemes that produce the more than 616,000 words in the Oxford English Dictionary, which can be arranged into an infinite number of sentences, paragraphs, Wu-Tang lyrics, or Shakespearean plays. And just as the structure of language starts small, so does how we learn language. And we start very young. The word "infant" comes from the Latin "in fans," meaning "not speaking." But as early as four months, they can recognize differences in speech

and start to read lips, matching mouth movements with their corresponding sounds like, "ah," "e," "i," "o." And even at this age, you got to watch what you say about kids in their presence, because this also marks the beginning of receptive language, or the ability to understand what's being said, both to and about us. Soon, that receptive language blooms to accommodate productive language, when instead of just understanding other people, babies start developing the ability to produce words. Of course, that takes a while, but in the meantime, they get a lot of practice babbling. Beginning at about four months, they start to make all sorts of sounds. Although you may get a "dada" or a "mama," babbling is not an imitation of adult speech. In fact, it typically includes sounds

from many different languages, and a stranger couldn't tell if a kid was Italian or Kenyan or Korean just by the sound of her babbling. Similarly, deaf babies will watch their parents signing and start babbling with their hands by about 10 months. That babbling morphs into something that starts to make sense, and "mama" probably really means "mama" now. Without exposure to other languages, a child will actually lose the ability to both hear and create particular tones and sounds that aren't part of his or her household language. So someone who speaks English around the house soon won't be able to differentiate between certain phonemes in Mandarin if they heard them, for instance, or between aspirated and non-aspirated consonants

in Hindi. By the time they're mowing down the first birthday cake, most kids will be entering the one-word stage of language development. They now know that sounds carry specific meanings, and connect the sound "dog" to that furry thing across the room. By around 18 months, their capacity for learning new words jumps from about one a week to one a day, and by the time they're two they're probably speaking in two-word statements. These choppy sentences are kind of like a telegraphic speech -- they sound like clumsy texts or old-school telegrams, using mostly nouns and verbs. "Want juice," "No pants," that kind of stuff. These little sentences make sense and they follow the rules of their language's syntax. For example, an English-speaking child would put an

adjective before a noun: "Black cat" while a Spanish speaker would reverse that: "gato negro." From there, the average kid is soon uttering longer phrases in complete sentences -- refusing to put pants on and demanding more crackers. Most humans hit these same milestones during their language development, but there are competing theories about how our infant babbles turn into complex sentences and how we acquire language. You'll remember B.F. Skinner, the pioneering behaviorist who brought us learning through reinforcement. He believed language was a product of associative principles and operant conditioning. Skinner argued that a kid learned to associate words with meanings largely through reinforcement. So in the Skinner model, for example, if baby Bruno says "mmmm" and his mother

gives him some milk, he'll find that outcome (both the milk and the attention) rewarding, and eventually, work his way up to saying, "milk," through these learned associations and shaping processes. It's good to be understood, right? But as usual, not everyone was on board with Skinner. In particular, legendary American linguist Noam Chomsky argued that a kid like Bruno would never reach his full, complex, sonnet-writing potential if his learning was dependent on conditioning alone. Chonsky instead proposed the idea of innate learning and ubiquitous grammatical categories, pointing out that while the world's thousands of languages may sound wildly diverse, they're actually very similar, sharing some basic elements. He called this "universal grammar."

Chomsky's universal grammar posited that all human languages contain nouns, verbs, and adjectives, and humans are born with an innate ability to acquire language, and even a genetic predisposition to learn grammatical rules, rather than being linguistic blank slates. Chomsky suggested that we're hardwired for it from day one. In the end though, we're still not sure how we acquire language; however, developmental research and studies of other species have given us a sense that at least some of it is innate, while the role of learning and exposure is also important. So if it's true that all humans have some innate capacity for language, where in the brain is it sitting? We've talked a lot about how function is localized in the brain, and that is definitely

true for some aspects of language, but while speaking, reading, writing, and even singing all fall under the language umbrella, their locations in the brain are a little more complicated. Consider aphasia, a neurological impairment of language. People can experience lots of different kinds of aphasia, depending on whether they've suffered an injury, or stroke, or a tumor, or dementia. So maybe they can speak but not read, maybe they can sing but barely speak, or write but not read. The region of the brain known as Broca's Area and the left frontal lobe is involved with the production of speech. If i suffered a trauma to this area, I might still comprehend speech but struggled to speak, although I might still be able to sing, because that's conducted elsewhere in the brain.

On the other hand, that falling coconut struck another region called the Vernicas Area, a region in the left temporal lobe involved in the expression and comprehension of language, I'd still be able to speak, but my language wouldn't make any sense, so you might find me saying something like, "it was two pizza i called purple brother on the television." Aphasia and other brain injuries remind us how thinking and language are both separate and intricately entwined. For instance, it's hard to say if non-verbal ideas come to us first and we think of the words to name them, or if instead, our thoughts are born in language. Or if we'd be able to even think without it. And because language often helps to frame your ideas, your thinking might

actually be influenced by which language you're using. So what are the implications of this? If we expand the definition of language to include other species, how might Kanzi's ability to communicate that he wants a marshmallow affect his thinking, and how might that thinking influence his language progression and his identity? If only i had the words to describe how fascinating this all is. If you understood the language I was using today, you learned how languages are built from phonemes, morphemes, and grammar; and when children acquire receptive and productive language and pass through the babbling one-word and two-word phases of development. You also learned some theories on how we acquire language, what brain areas are involved, and

how thinking and language are connected. Thanks for watching, especially to all of our Subbable subscribers.

### Transcript (navigation)

- [00:00] Baby Kanzi was recently adopted and adjusting to life in his new home. His mother was working
- [00:06] with a language coach to learn some English, and Kanzi usually came along, though he didn't
- [00:11] appear to pay much attention. But the language coach noticed that he seemed to be picking up
- [00:15] on how to communicate just by watching his mother's lessons. Oddly enough, it appeared
- [00:20] that he was picking things up faster than his mom. For example, the phrases, "You tickle"
- [00:24] and "tickle you" meant two different things. And Kanzi's mom, she was having a hard time
- [00:29] understanding that syntax. One day, Kanzi was hanging out, playing with stuffed animals, and
- [00:33] the coach asked him to make the dog bite the snake. Kanzi put the snake into the dog's mouth
- [00:39] like it was no big deal. It was a really big deal, because Kanzi is a bonobo. He's actually a
- [00:44] language superstar. Even among the elite research primates, like Koko the gorilla, Kanzi
- [00:49] was the first ape to demonstrate that language can be acquired spontaneously through
- [00:54] observation, without planned training, and the first to show a rudimentary understanding of
- [00:59] grammar, syntax, and semantics. Again, really big deal! Especially because for years, humans
- [01:05] have been proclaiming that it's language that sets us apart from other animals. But are we
- [01:10] really alone? Turns out, that question keeps getting more and more complicated.
- [01:14] Technically, we define language as a set of spoken, written, or signed words, and the way
- [01:19] we combine them to communicate meaning. If we change that definition to include the use
- [01:23] of complex grammar, then maybe we are alone.
- [01:26] But if language is simply  the ability to communicate
- [01:28] through a meaningful sequence  of symbols, as I might
- [01:31] do while looking for a  bathroom in Sweden, or Kanzi
- [01:34] does when she's asking for roast marshmallows,  well then welcome to the club, apes!
- [01:40] [INTRO MUSIC]
- [01:48] We communicate in part by engaging our brains and bodies to make sounds that let us transfer
- [01:54] thoughts from our brain to other people's brains. But of course, language is more than just making
- [01:59] air vibrate with sound. I can communicate by moving my hands, which you might have noticed
- [02:04] I do pretty frequently, or  by using visual symbols.
- [02:06] All of these forms of language allow us to
- [02:08] comprehend things we've never actually witnessed, and exchange information with each other quickly
- [02:12] and effectively to, y'know,  get a job, or be a friend,
- [02:16] or use a metaphor. It's  hard to imagine a fulfilling
- [02:18] life without some kind of language. Humans have nearly 7,000 different languages and
- [02:23] no matter how different they sound, we can break down their basic structure in the same
- [02:27] way, using the same three building blocks. The smallest of them are phonemes.
- [02:32] These are very short, distinctive sound units like "a," "t," "ch," "sh," like, stuff like that.
- [02:38] English uses about 40 of them. Phonemes go together to make morphemes, which are
- [02:43] the smallest units that carry meaning. This can be words or parts of words, like a prefix
- [02:47] or a suffix for example. The word "speech" is a morpheme that contains four phoneme
- [02:51] sound units: "s," "p," "ee," "ch." From there, you arrange morphemes into your language's
- [02:57] grammar or system of rules, allowing you to say the things that you want to say.
- [03:00] So those 40 English phonemes give us over 100,000 morphemes that produce the more
- [03:05] than 616,000 words in the Oxford English Dictionary, which can be arranged into an
- [03:11] infinite number of sentences, paragraphs, Wu-Tang lyrics, or Shakespearean plays.
- [03:16] And just as the structure of language starts small, so does how we learn language.
- [03:21] And we start very young. The word "infant" comes from the Latin "in fans," meaning
- [03:25] "not speaking." But as early as four months, they can recognize differences in speech
- [03:30] and start to read lips, matching mouth movements
- [03:33] with their corresponding sounds  like, "ah," "e," "i," "o."
- [03:37] And even at this age, you got to watch what you say about kids in their presence, because this
- [03:40] also marks the beginning of receptive language, or the ability to understand what's being said,
- [03:45] both to and about us. Soon,  that receptive language
- [03:49] blooms to accommodate productive language,
- [03:51] when instead of just understanding other people, babies start developing the ability to produce
- [03:56] words. Of course, that takes a while, but in the meantime, they get a lot of practice babbling.
- [04:00] Beginning at about four months, they start to make all sorts of sounds. Although you may get
- [04:05] a "dada" or a "mama," babbling is not an imitation
- [04:08] of adult speech. In fact,  it typically includes sounds
- [04:10] from many different languages, and a stranger
- [04:13] couldn't tell if a kid was  Italian or Kenyan or Korean
- [04:15] just by the sound of her babbling. Similarly, deaf babies will watch their parents signing and start
- [04:21] babbling with their hands by about 10 months. That babbling morphs into something that starts
- [04:25] to make sense, and "mama" probably really means "mama" now. Without exposure to other languages,
- [04:31] a child will actually lose  the ability to both hear
- [04:34] and create particular tones and sounds that
- [04:37] aren't part of his or her household language. So someone who speaks English around the
- [04:40] house soon won't be able to differentiate between certain phonemes in Mandarin
- [04:44] if they heard them, for instance, or between aspirated and non-aspirated consonants
- [04:49] in Hindi. By the time they're mowing down the first birthday cake, most kids will be
- [04:52] entering the one-word stage of language development. They now know that sounds
- [04:55] carry specific meanings, and connect the sound "dog" to that furry thing across
- [04:59] the room. By around 18 months, their capacity for learning new words jumps from about
- [05:03] one a week to one a day, and by the time they're
