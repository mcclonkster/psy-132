### Transcript (reading)

Say it's late at night, you're home alone drifting off to sleep, just, entering that dream about Fritos, and then suddenly there's a banging at the door! Suddenly you're wide awake and it feels like your heart's gonna explode. You jump up ready to run out the back door, possibly grab a Phillips head screwdriver and stab it into the darkness until it sticks into something. Now whether it's a Weeping Angel or your neighbor looking to borrow a can of beans, it doesn't really matter because when you heard that sudden noise, your startled brain released an icy typhoon of chemicals. And everything that's now going through your mind, like your urge to flee, your urge to defend yourself, that internal debate about whether Weeping Angels are even real and "Woah!

Where's the cat?" All that? Is just a result of those chemicals. Our brains and our nervous systems and the substances they produce and are always bathed in are amazingly complex nuanced systems. And even though we're always talking about our mental activities being somehow separate from all the biological stuff going on in our bodies, in reality, the moods, ideas, impulses, that flash through our minds are spurred by our biological condition. As psychologists like to say, "Everything psychological is biological." So one way to understand how your mind works is to look at how the chemistry of your body influences how you think, sense, and feel about the world around you.

To do that, we begin at the simplest level, the system with the smallest parts, it's all about the neuron, baby. [Intro] Neurons, or nerve cells, are the building blocks that comprise our nervous systems. Neurons share the same basic makeup as our other cells, but they have electrochemical mojo that lets them transmit messages to each other. Your brain alone is made up of billions of neurons, and to understand why we think or dream or do anything, you gotta first understand how these little transmitters work. You actually have several different types of neurons in your body, from ones that are less than a millimeter long in your brain to ones that run the whole length of your leg!

Yes, you have cells as long as your legs, which is nothing compared to the hundred and fifty feet the nerve cells of some dinosaurs had to be, I'm getting off topic, sorry. No matter how big a nerve is, they all have the same three basic parts: the soma, dendrites, and axon. The soma, or cell body, is basically the neuron's life support; it contains all that necessary cell action like the nucleus, DNA, mitochondria, ribosomes, and such. So, if the soma dies, the whole neuron goes with it. The dendrites, as bushy and branch-like as the trees they're named after, receive messages and gossip from other cells. They're the listeners, whispering what they hear back to the soma.

The axon is the talker. This long, cable-like extension transmits electrical impulses from the cell body out to other neurons or glands or muscles. Whereas the dendrites are short and bushy, the axon fiber is long, and, depending on what type of neuron it is, is sometimes encased in a protective layer of fatty tissue, called the myelin sheath. It's almost like an insulated electrical wire, the myelin sheath speeds up the transmission of messages, and if it degrades, as it does with those affected with multiple sclerosis, those signals are degraded as well, eventually leading to lack of muscle control. Neurons transmit signals either when stimulated by sensory input or triggered by neighboring neurons.

The dendrites pick up the signal and activate the neuron's action potential, or firing impulse, that shoots an electrical charge down the axon to its terminals and towards the neighboring neurons. The contact points between neurons are called synapses. All those bushy little dendrites are decorated with synapses that almost but don't quite touch the neighboring axon in the tiniest game of "I'm not touching you!" of all time. They're less than a millionth of an inch apart. And that microscopic cleft is called the synaptic gap. So, when an action potential runs down to the end of an axon, it activates the chemical messengers that jump that tiny synaptic gap, flying like that little air kiss and landing on the receptor sites of the receiving neuron.

Those messengers are neurotransmitters. Although neurotransmitters slide right into their intended receptors like a key into a lock, they don't stay bonded to the receiving neuron. They just sort of pop out, having excited or inhibited the receiving neuron's trigger, then the extras immediately get reabsorbed by the neuron that released them in the first place in a process called reuptake. Kinda like, "Here you go, oh, psych!" So neurons communicate with neurotransmitters which in turn cause motion and emotion; they help us move around, make jazz hands, learn, feel, remember, stay alert, get sleepy, and pretty much do everything we do. Some of them just make you feel good, like the endorphins we get flooded with after running

ten miles or falling in love or eating a really good piece of pie. We've got over 100 different kinds of these brilliant neurotransmitters -- some are excitatory and others are inhibitory, and all are good reminders that everything psychological is also biological. Excitatory neurotransmitters rev up the neuron, increasing the chances it will fire off an action potential. Norepinephrine is one you're probably familiar with, it helps control alertness and arousal. Glutamate is another, involved in memory, but an over-supply of it can wig out the brain and cause seizures and migraines which is why some people are sensitive to all that MSG, or monosodium glutamate, in their Ramen.

Inhibitory neurotransmitters on the other hand, chill neurons out, decreasing the likelihood that the neuron will jump into action. GABA– gamma-aminobutyric acid– is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter, and you've probably heard of serotonin which affects your mood and hunger and sleep. Low amounts of serotonin are linked to depression, and a certain class of antidepressants help raise serotonin levels in the brain. Some neurotransmitters like acetylcholine and dopamine play both sides and can both excite or inhibit neurons depending on what type of receptors they encounter. Acetylcholine enables muscle action and influences learning and memory; Alzheimer's patients experience a deterioration of their acetylcholine producing neurons.

Dopamine, meanwhile, is associated with learning, movement, and pleasurable emotions, and excessive amounts of it are linked to schizophrenia as well as addictive and impulsive behavior. So neurotransmitters are basically your nervous system's couriers. But they aren't the only chemical messengers delivering the news; they've got some competition brewing in the endocrine system. And if you've been through puberty, you know what I'm talking about: hormones. Like neurotransmitters, hormones act on the brain, and indeed some of them are chemically identical to certain neurotransmitters. Hormones affect our moods, arousal, and circadian rhythm, they regulate our metabolism, monitor our immune system, signal growth, and help with sexual reproduction.

You could say that most of them boil down to the basics: attraction, appetite, and aggression. Whereas neurons and synapses flick on and off, sending messages with amazing speed, the endocrine system likes to take its time, delivering the body's slow chemical communications through a set of glands that secrete hormones into the bloodstream where they're ferried to other tissues, especially the brain. So while the nervous and endocrine systems are similar, in that they both produce chemicals destined to hit up certain receptors, they operate at very different speeds. It's like, if the nervous system wants to get in touch with you, it sends you a text. But if the endocrine system has a message, it will like lick the stamp, and put it on,

and write your address, and then a note and a pen on paper, and then fold it up and put and mail it to you with the Post Office. But fast isn't always better, and your body will remember that letter longer than the text. Hormones, they linger. Which helps explain why it takes some time to simmer down after a moment of severe fright or anger. And our endocrine systems have a few important hormone brewing glands. We've got a pair of adrenal glands snuggled up against our kidneys that secrete adrenaline, that famous fight or flight hormone that jacks up your heart rate, blood pressure and blood sugar, giving you that tidal wave of energy preparing you to run like heck or punch that charging baboon in the throat; the pancreas sits right next to the adrenal gland and oozes

insulin and glucagon hormones that monitor how you absorb sugar, your bodies main source of fuel. Your thyroid and parathyroid glands at the base of your throat secrete hormones that regulate your metabolism and monitor your body's calcium levels; if you have testicles, they're secreting your sex hormones like estrogen and testosterone, and if you've got ovaries, they're doing that job. And all those glands are super important, but there is one gland that rules them all, and in the darkness binds them: the pituitary gland. Although it's just a little pea-sized nugget hidden deep in the bunker of the brain, it is the most influential gland in this system. It releases a vital growth hormone that spurs physical development and that love hormone,

oxytocin, that promotes warm, fuzzy feelings of trust and social bonding. What really makes the pituitary the master gland is that its secretions boss around the other endocrine glands, but even the pituitary has a master in the hypothalamus region of the brain, which we will talk more about next episode. So, AHHHHHHHHH! if I managed to scare you, sorry, but I'm illustrating a point. You have no control over being scared, but maybe now you do understand a little more clearly how your nervous and endocrine systems worked together to call the shots. First, the sensory input from your eyes and ears went to your brain, the simplest bits of your hypothalamus without even letting you analyze it and were like ahhhh, and then,

that ran down the chain of command from your pituitary to your adrenal glands, to the hormone adrenaline, to the rest of your body and then back to your brain, which then realized that I was just messing with you and told everybody to just calm down for once! The whole deal is a feedback loop: your nervous system directs your endocrine system which directs your nervous system, brain, gland, hormone, brain. And of course each of these systems is fantastically complex. Way more than we can get into here. So, in our next lesson, we're gonna get all up in your brain, and delve deeper into the different components of your nervous system, find out what your old brain is, and learn about how much of your brain you actually use.

In the meantime, thank you for watching this lesson in Crash Course Psychology which was brought to you by Zane Ice, who wants to say hi to his friend Harrison. Thank you, Zane.

### Transcript (reading)

In the early 1800's, German physician, Franz Joseph Gall spent a lot of time running his fingers over the scalps of strangers. He wasn't a hairdresser, he wasn't a masseuse, he wasn't just like a big fan of heads. He was a phrenologist, he was the first phrenologist. Gall believed that a persons personality was linked to their skull morphology, that its bumps and ridges indicated aspects of their character. Amazingly this "science" actually caught on, was widely practiced for decades, and Gall became something of a celebrity. Well, with a head like his, one can see how he might have been a little bit fixated with skull shape. Eventually, phrenology was dismissed as a cult pseudoscience because it turns out your

cranial contours tell us exactly nothing about what's happening inside the brain. And yet! Gall was actually on to something big, something that we knew nothing about. Remember, at this point we were just starting to get consensus that the brain was the source of self and not like the soul or the heart or whatever. His lasting and correct proposition was that different parts of the brain control specific aspects of our behavior. Like we talked about last time, there is a strong link between biological activity and psychological events. But in addition to the interplay of chemicals like neurotransmitters and hormones, a lot of this has to do with that localized parts of the brain have specific functions, like vision, movement, memory, speech, and even facial recognition. Function,

in other words, is localized. If you could stimulate different parts of my brain in any way you wanted to– and if you ask me nicely, I just might let you– you could control my movements, my memories, and even my personality. Poke my brain over here and my arm would twitch, poke here and I'd remember my first kiss, do it up her and suddenly I'd be filled with a tremendous Hulk-like rage! This is the link between the brain, that physical hunk of gunk between the ears, and the mind, the thing that is us, our consciousness, our behavior, our decisions, our memories, our selves. Some neuroscientists like to say that the mind is what the brain does, so one of the driving questions of psychology and, like, the human experiment is "How do our brains'

functions tie to the behavior of the mind?" And you can't even ask the right questions, let alone get at some of the answers, until you get to know the brain. [Intro] You might have a passing familiarity with your nervous system, like, "The brain bone is connected to the spinal cord bone, and the spinal cord bone is connected to the motoneuron bone." That's your central nervous system, and there aren't actually any bones. Your central nervous system, or just CNS, is what makes your bodies big decisions. This system is the command center, and if you mess with it, things are gonna get weird. There's also the peripheral nervous system, which is composed of scout-like sensory neurons that gather information and report it back to the central nervous system.

To get a handle on just how physical the roots of your mind and personality are, how concretely your nervous system makes you you, let me tell you a story. The curious case of Phineas Gage. In 1848, a genial chap named Phineas Gage was working on the railroad, tamping gunpowder into a blasting hole with an iron rod, but the gunpowder ignited.The resulting explosion caused the rod to shoot like a bullet up through his left cheek and out of the top of his head. There's brain in between those two places, by the way. Amazingly, he stood up after the accident, and walked over to a cart, described what had happened, and then they drove him back to his house, all while he was conscious.

So the doctor came to examine him, and refused to believe that a rod had in fact passed through his head, understandably. Until Phineas started coughing and an amount of brain that the doctor described as a teacup-ful fell out of his head, and the doctor had to accept indeed what had happened. After a few months of convalescing, he was pretty much healed up and moving around like he used to. But his friends were saying that Phineas was no longer like himself. Yes he had his memories and his mental abilities, and he walked and talked and looked the same, minus an eyeball, whereas the old Phineas was mild-mannered and soft-spoken, the post-spike-to-the-brain Phineas was surly and mean-spirited and vulgar. People started to describe him as "no longer Gage."

Phineas moved away from America, the scientific establishment lost contact with him and 12 years later, after a series of seizures he died at the age of 36. Phineas is a great, if extreme, example of how function is localized in the brain and how physical and biological factors can be reflected in psychological ways. Of course he is also an excellent example of how individual studies are not particularly useful, especially since we have very little data on what Phineas was actually like before or even after his accident. Most accounts are from the months directly after the accident, and many of them conflict. It's completely possible that he continued to heal and lived his remaining years as a happy and productive citizen.

Intro-psychology texts often paint the simple picture of Phineas just so we can have a clear example of the moment when physicians realized that messing with the brain was messing with the mind, but it is of course all much more complicated and Phineas was an actual, real life person, I feel that we should give him the nuance and mystery that he deserves. Now you might have heard that we only used about 10 percent of our brains, and oh if that were true, Phineas would lose a quarter of his and he'd be just fine. And if we could just harness the rest of that gray mush, we'd be able to mind read and levitate and get all Professor X. It's an exciting thought, as exciting as the idea that I can tell what kind of tea you like by feeling the bumps on your head. It is also exactly as wrong.

After watching an hour or so of reality TV, you'd be forgiven for thinking that some people are only working at 10 percent brain capacity. But in actual reality, brain scans show that nearly every region of the brain lights up during even simple tasks like walking and talking. Not only that, but the brain itself requires 20 percent of all the body's energy, and it would make little evolutionary sense to throw much energy away at something that is only minimally active. As animals, our capabilities have developed in part from our brain structures. We're actually able to trace our evolutionary history as we come to understand these structures. Less complex animals have simpler brains designed for basic functioning and survival: rest,

breathe, eat. Whereas more complex animals like many mammals possess brains that feel, remember, reason, and predict. These animals don't have all new systems. They have new brain systems built upon old brain systems. The brain is kind of like a set of Russian nesting dolls. The outermost wooden doll is the newest, most detailed and most complex, but as you go deeper, the dolls become older and smaller, and simpler, and more generic. The innermost wooden doll is the oldest, most basic. It's like a fossil in your head. This inner core of the brain, sometimes called the "old brain" still performs for us much as it did for our early evolutionary ancestors. It's anchored by the brainstem, the most ancient

and central core of the brain where the spinal brain enters the skull. Above it, at the base of the skull, is the medulla. Here, old brain functions happen automatically without any conscious effort: the beating of hearts, the breathing of lungs, that sort of thing. The pons is perched on the medulla, and it helps coordinate movement. Above the pons, at the top of the brainstem, is the thalamus, a pair of egg-shaped structures that take in sensory information related to seeing, hearing, touching, and tasting. The reticular formation is a finger-shaped nerve network inside the brain stem that's essential for arousal, which isn't necessarily what you feel upon seeing a particularly nice-looking human, but instead refers to

things like sleeping and walking and pain perception; other important functions. The baseball-sized cerebellum, or "little brain", swells from the bottom of the brain stem and is responsible for non-verbal learning and memory, the perception of time, and modulating motions, it controls voluntary movement like your sweet dance moves, but it also gets impaired easily under the influence of alcohol, hence the term "tipsy". So the old brain systems keep our body's basic functions running smoothly; the sort of stuff any animal might need. This is pretty much where the brain stops for reptiles. For higher functions, we look to the limbic system. This includes the amygdala, hypothalamus, and hippocampus. Sort of a border region of the brain separating the old brain and the

newer, higher cerebral areas. The amygdala consists of two lima bean-sized clusters of neurons and is responsible for memory consolidation as well as both our greatest fear and hottest aggression. Stimulate one area of the amygdala, and a docile family dog suddenly morphs into a blood thirsty Cujo. Shift that electrode over just a tiny bit and that dog will be cowering at butterfly shadow puppets. The hypothalamus keeps your whole body steady, regulating body temperatures, circadian rhythms, and hunger, also helps govern the endocrine system, especially the pituitary gland. You should also thank your hypothalamus for allowing you to feel pleasure and reward. Rats implanted with electrodes in the reward center of their

hypothalamuses and given ways to self stimulate those areas will essentially reward themselves until they collapse or die. So, use with caution. The final part of the limbic system is the hippocampus, central to learning and memory, and if it's damaged, a person may lose their ability to retain new facts and memories. Now above all of this is the most advanced stuff - the stuff that you think of when you think of the brain - the grey matter. The two hemispheres of your cerebrum make up about eighty-five percent of your brain weight, and oversee your ability to think, speak, and perceive. The left and right hemispheres govern and regulate different functions, giving us a split brain, connected by a structure called the corpus callosum. So, for instance,

language production is controlled largely by the left hemisphere, while certain creative functions are controlled by the right. Though this has nothing to do with handedness or people having dominant sides of their brain being more analytical or creative or whatever - that's part of what we call pop psychology: a behavioral disorder in which journalists and arm chair psychologists use research showing beautiful, detailed, intimately connected complexities of your brain to sell newspapers or reinforce previously held beliefs. Yes, some tasks are distributed to one side, but the sides are deeply and constantly connected; a statement as general as "artistic people use their right brains" is as useless as saying "artistic people have particularly bumpy heads".

Finally, covering the left and right hemispheres, we have the cerebral cortex, a thin layer of over twenty billion interconnected neurons. But let's not forget the unsung heroes of your nervous system: the billions of non-neuron glial cells, which provide a spider web of support that surround, insulate, and nourish the cerebral neurons. You've probably seen enough brain diagrams to know that the cerebral cortex's left and right sides are subdivided into four lobes: the frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal, all separated by especially prominent folds, or fissures. Each lobe does indeed have its own set of duties, and would have made Franz Gall proud. The frontal lobes, just behind your forehead, are involved in speaking, planning, judging,

abstract thinking, and as the tale of Phineas Gage reminds us, aspects of personality. The parietal lobes receive and process your sense of touch and body position. At the back of your head, the occipital lobes receive information related to sight. And the temporal lobes just above your ears process sound, including speech comprehension. Remember that each hemisphere controls the opposite side of the body, so my left temporal lobe processes sounds heard through my right ear. And within these lobes there are still more regions that have specialized functions. Your motor cortex at the rear of your frontal lobes, for example, controls voluntary movements and sends messages from the brain out to the body like "pet that dog!" or "pick up that mug", while your somatosensory cortex right

behind it processes incoming sensations like "Oooooh, that doggie is soft!" or "Gah, the mug is hot!" The rest of your grey matter is made up of association areas that are related to higher mental functions like remembering, thinking, learning, and speaking. But the thing about association areas is that unlike your sensory or motor cortex, you couldn't just poke one and create a neat response. Association areas are more subtle; they deal with things like interpreting and integrating sensory input and linking up with memories. And they prevail throughout all four lobes, so brain damage to different areas will cause very different results. A lesion on a specific part of the temporal lobe may destroy a person's ability to recognize

faces; traumatic memories or overactive hormones can profoundly affect our behavior and emotions - all of which remind us how fundamentally biology and psychology are intertwined. And there are few more fascinating examples of this than how we sense and perceive the world around us, so that's where we're gonna pick up next week. For now, if you were paying attention, you learned the basics of the central nervous system, specifically the brain, which can be understood in terms of old or of more evolutionary ancestral structures, along with the limbic system, and new structures, which include lobes, cortices, and association areas.

### Transcript (navigation)

- [00:00] In the early 1800's, German physician, Franz Joseph Gall spent a lot of time running his
- [00:05] fingers over the scalps of strangers. He wasn't a hairdresser, he wasn't a masseuse, he wasn't
- [00:11] just like a big fan of heads. He was a phrenologist, he was the first phrenologist. Gall believed
- [00:16] that a persons personality was linked to their skull morphology, that its bumps and ridges
- [00:21] indicated aspects of their character. Amazingly this "science" actually caught on, was widely
- [00:26] practiced for decades, and Gall became something of a celebrity.
- [00:30] Well, with a head like his, one can see how he might have been a little bit fixated with
- [00:35] skull shape.
- [00:36] Eventually, phrenology was dismissed as a cult pseudoscience because it turns out your
- [00:40] cranial contours tell us exactly nothing about what's happening inside the brain.
- [00:44] And yet! Gall was actually on to something big, something that we knew nothing about.
- [00:48] Remember, at this point we were just starting to get consensus that the brain was the source
- [00:52] of self and not like the soul or the heart or whatever. His lasting and correct proposition
- [00:57] was that different parts of the brain control specific aspects of our behavior.
- [01:01] Like we talked about last time, there is a strong link between biological activity and
- [01:05] psychological events. But in addition to the interplay of chemicals like neurotransmitters
- [01:09] and hormones, a lot of this has to do with that localized parts of the brain have specific
- [01:14] functions, like vision, movement, memory, speech, and even facial recognition. Function,
- [01:19] in other words, is localized.
- [01:21] If you could stimulate different parts of my brain in any way you wanted to– and if
- [01:23] you ask me nicely, I just might let you– you could control my movements, my memories,
- [01:27] and even my personality. Poke my brain over here and my arm would twitch, poke here and
- [01:32] I'd remember my first kiss, do it up her and suddenly I'd be filled with a tremendous Hulk-like
- [01:36] rage!
- [01:37] This is the link between the brain, that physical hunk of gunk between the ears, and the mind,
- [01:42] the thing that is us, our consciousness, our behavior, our decisions, our memories, our
- [01:48] selves. Some neuroscientists like to say that the mind is what the brain does, so one of
- [01:53] the driving questions of psychology and, like, the human experiment is "How do our brains'
- [01:58] functions tie to the behavior of the mind?" And you can't even ask the right questions,
- [02:03] let alone get at some of the answers, until you get to know the brain.
- [02:09] [Intro]
- [02:12] You might have a passing familiarity with your nervous system, like, "The brain bone
- [02:19] is connected to the spinal cord bone, and the spinal cord bone is connected to the motoneuron
- [02:24] bone." That's your central nervous system, and there aren't actually any bones. Your
- [02:28] central nervous system, or just CNS, is what makes your bodies big decisions. This system
- [02:32] is the command center, and if you mess with it, things are gonna get weird. There's also
- [02:36] the peripheral nervous system, which is composed of scout-like sensory neurons that gather
- [02:40] information and report it back to the central nervous system.
- [02:43] To get a handle on just how physical the roots of your mind and personality are, how concretely
- [02:48] your nervous system makes you you, let me tell you a story. The curious case of Phineas
- [02:53] Gage. In 1848, a genial chap named Phineas Gage was working on the railroad, tamping
- [02:58] gunpowder into a blasting hole with an iron rod, but the gunpowder ignited.The resulting
- [03:03] explosion caused the rod to shoot like a bullet up through his left cheek and out of the top
- [03:08] of his head. There's brain in between those two places, by the way. Amazingly, he stood
- [03:13] up after the accident, and walked over to a cart, described what had happened, and then
- [03:17] they drove him back to his house, all while he was conscious.
- [03:20] So the doctor came to examine him, and refused to believe that a rod had in fact passed through
- [03:25] his head, understandably. Until Phineas started coughing and an amount of brain that the doctor
- [03:31] described as a teacup-ful fell out of his head, and the doctor had to accept indeed
- [03:37] what had happened. After a few months of convalescing, he was pretty much healed up and moving around
- [03:42] like he used to. But his friends were saying that Phineas was no longer like himself. Yes
- [03:47] he had his memories and his mental abilities, and he walked and talked and looked the same,
- [03:52] minus an eyeball, whereas the old Phineas was mild-mannered and soft-spoken, the post-spike-to-the-brain
- [03:58] Phineas was surly and mean-spirited and vulgar. People started to describe him as "no longer
- [04:03] Gage."
- [04:04] Phineas moved away from America, the scientific establishment lost contact with him and 12
- [04:08] years later, after a series of seizures he died at the age of 36. Phineas is a great,
- [04:13] if extreme, example of how function is localized in the brain and how physical and biological
- [04:17] factors can be reflected in psychological ways. Of course he is also an excellent example
- [04:22] of how individual studies are not particularly useful, especially since we have very little

- [04:59] that were true, Phineas would lose a quarter of his and he'd be just fine. And if we could
- [05:03] just harness the rest of that gray mush, we'd be able to mind read and levitate and get
- [05:07] all Professor X. It's an exciting thought, as exciting as the idea that I can tell what

### Transcript (reading)

Let me tell you about Oliver Sacks, the famous physician, professor and author of unusual neurological case studies. We’ll be looking at some of his fascinating research in future lessons, but for now, I just want to talk about Sacks himself. Although he possesses a brilliant and inquisitive mind, Dr. Sacks cannot do a simple thing that your average toddler can. He can’t recognize his own face in the mirror. Sacks has a form of prosopagnosia, a neurological disorder that impairs a person’s ability to perceive or recognize faces, also known as face blindness. Last week we talked about how brain function is localized, and this is another peculiarly excellent example of that.

Sacks can recognize his coffee cup on the shelf, but he can’t pick out his oldest friend from a crowd, because the specific sliver of his brain responsible for facial recognition is malfunctioning. There’s nothing wrong with his vision. The sense is intact. The problem is with his perception, at least when it comes to recognizing faces. Prosopagnosia is a good example of how sensing and perceiving are connected, but different. Sensation is the bottom-up process by which our senses, like vision, hearing and smell, receive and relay outside stimuli. Perception, on the other hand, is the top-down way our brains organize and interpret that information and put it into context.

So right now at this very moment, you’re probably receiving light from your screen through your eyes, which will send the data of that sensation to your brain. Perception meanwhile is your brain telling you that what you’re seeing is a diagram explaining the difference between sensation and perception, which is pretty meta. Now your brain is interpreting that light as a talking person, whom your brain might additionally recognize as Hank. [Intro] We are constantly bombarded by stimuli even though we’re only aware of what our own senses can pick up. Like I can see and hear and feel and even smell this Corgi, but I can’t hunt using sonar like a bat or hear a mole tunneling underground like an owl or see ultraviolet and infrared light like a mantis shrimp.

I probably can’t even smell half of what you can smell. No! No! We have different senses. Mwah mwah mwah mwah mwah. Yeah. There’s a lot to sense in the world, and not everybody needs to sense all the same stuff. So every animal has its limitations which we can talk about more precisely if we define the Absolute Threshold of Sensation, the minimum stimulation needed to register a particular stimulus, 50% of the time. So if I play a tiny little beep in your ear and you tell me that you hear it fifty percent of the times that I play it, that’s your absolute threshold of sensation. We have to use a percentage because sometimes I'll play the beep and you’ll hear it and sometimes you won’t even though it’s the exact same volume.

Why? Because brains are complicated. Detecting a weak sensory signal like that beep in daily life isn’t only about the strength of the stimulus. It’s also about your psychological state; your alertness and expectations in the moment. This has to do with Signal Detection Theory, a model for predicting how and when a person will detect a weak stimuli, partly based on context. Exhausted new parents might hear their baby’s tiniest whimper, but not even register the bellow of a passing train. Their paranoid parent brains are so trained on their baby, it gives their senses a sort of boosted ability, but only in relation to the subject of their attention. Conversely, if you’re experiencing constant stimulation, your senses will adjust in a process called sensory adaptation.

It is the reason that I have to check and see if my wallet is there if it’s in my right pocket, but if I move it to my left pocket, it feels like a big uncomfortable lump. It’s also useful to be able to talk about our ability to detect the difference between two stimuli. I might go out at night and look up at the sky and, well, I know with my objective science brain that no two stars have the exact same brightness, and yeah, I can tell with my eyeballs that some stars are brighter than others, but other stars just look exactly the same to me. I can’t tell the difference in their brightness. Are you done? Is it time for your to go? Gimme, gimme a kiiiissss. Yes, yes. Okay.

Good girl. The point at which one can tell the difference is the difference threshold, but it’s not linear. Like. if a tiny star is just a tiny bit brighter than another tiny star, I can tell. But if a big star is that same tiny amount brighter than another big star, I won’t be able to tell the difference. This is important enough that we gave the guy who discovered it a law. Weber’s Law says that we perceive differences on a logarithmic, not a linear scale. It’s not the amount of change. It’s the percentage change that matters. Alright. How about now we take a more in depth look at how one of our most powerful senses works? Vision. Your ability to see your face in the mirror is the result of a long but lightning quick sequence of events.

Light bounces off your face and then off the mirror and then into your eyes, which take in all that varied energy and transforms it into neural messages that your brain processes and organizes into what you actually see, which is your face. Or if you’re looking elsewhere, you could see a coffee cup or a Corgi or a scary clown holding a tiny cream pie. So how do we transform light waves into meaningful information? Well, let’s start with the light itself. What we humans see as light is only a small fraction of the full spectrum of electromagnetic radiation that ranges from gamma to radio waves. Now light has all kinds of fascinating characteristics that determine how we sense it, but for the purposes of this topic, we’ll understand light as traveling in waves.

The wave’s wavelength and frequency determines their hue, and their amplitude determines their intensity or brightness. For instance a short wave has a high frequency. Our eyes register short wavelengths with high frequencies as blueish colors while we see long, low frequency wavelengths as reddish hues. The way we register the brightness of a color, the contrast between the orange of a sherbet and the orange of a construction cone has to do with the intensity or amount of energy in a given light wave. Which as we’ve just said is determined by its amplitude. Greater amplitude means higher intensity, means brighter color. Someone’s just told me that sherbet doesn’t- isn’t a word that exists.

His name is Michael Aranda and he’s a dumbhead. Did you type it into the dictionary? Type it into Google. Ask Google about sherbet. So sherbet is a thing. So after taking this light in through the cornea and the pupil, it hits the transparent disc behind the pupil: the lens, which focuses the light rays into specific images, and just as you’d expect the lens to do, it projects these images onto the retina, the inner surface of the eyeball that contains all the receptor cells that begin sensing that visual information. Now your retinas don’t receive a full image like a movie being projected onto a screen. It’s more like a bunch of pixel points of light energy that millions of receptors translate into neural impulses and zip back into the brain.

These retinal receptors are called rods and cones. Our rods detect gray scale and are used in our peripheral vision as well as to avoid stubbing our toes in twilight conditions when we can’t really see in color. Our cones detect fine detail and color. Concentrated near the retina’s central focal point called the fovea, cones function only in well lit conditions, allowing you to appreciate the intricacies of your grandma’s china pattern or your uncle’s sleeve tattoo. And the human eye is terrific at seeing color. Our difference threshold for colors is so exceptional that the average person can distinguish a million different hues. There’s a good deal of ongoing research around exactly how our color vision works.

But two theories help us explain some of what we know. One model, called the Young-Helmholtz trichromatic theory suggests that the retina houses three specific color receptor cones that register red, green and blue, and when stimulated together, their combined power allows the eye to register any color. Unless, of course you’re colorblind. About one in fifty people have some level of color vision deficiency. They’re mostly dudes because the genetic defect is sex linked. If you can’t see the Crash Course logo pop out at you in this figure, it’s likely that your red or green cones are missing or malfunctioning which means you have dichromatic instead of trichromatic vision and can’t distinguish between shades of red and green.

The other model for color vision, known as the opponent-process theory, suggests that we see color through processes that actually work against each other. So some receptor cells might be stimulated by red but inhibited by green, while others do the opposite, and those combinations allow us to register colors. But back to your eyeballs. When stimulated, the rods and cones trigger chemical changes that spark neural signals which in turn activate the cells behind them called bipolar cells, whose job it is to turn on the neighboring ganglion cells. The long axon tails of these ganglions braid together to form the ropy optic nerve, which is what carries the neural impulses from the eyeball to the brain.

That visual information then slips through a chain of progressively complex levels as it travels from optic nerve, to the thalamus, and on to the brain’s visual cortex. The visual cortex sits at the back of the brain in the occipital lobe, where the right cortex processes input from the left eye and vice versa. This cortex has specialized nerve cells, called feature detectors that respond to specific features like shapes, angles and movements. In other words different parts of your visual cortex are responsible for identifying different aspects of things. A person who can’t recognize human faces may have no trouble picking out their set of keys from a pile on the counter.

That’s because the brains object perception occurs in a different place from its face perception. In the case of Dr. Sacks, his condition affects the region of the brain called the fusiform gyrus, which activates in response to seeing faces. Sacks’s face blindness is congenital, but it may also be acquired through disease or injury to that same region of the brain. And some cells in a region may respond to just one type of stimulus, like posture or movement or facial expression, while other clusters of cells weave all that separate information together in an instant analysis of a situation. That clown is frowning and running at me with a tiny cream pie. I’m putting these factors together.

Maybe I should get out of here. This ability to process and analyze many separate aspects of the situation at once is called parallel processing. In the case of visual processing, this means that the brain simultaneously works on making sense of form, depth, motion and color and this is where we enter the whole world of perception which gets complicated quickly, and can even get downright philosophical. So we’ll be exploring that in depth next time but for now, if you were paying attention, you learned the difference between sensation and perception, the different thresholds that limit our senses, and some of the neurology and biology and psychology of human vision.

### Transcript (navigation)

- [00:00] Let me tell you about Oliver Sacks, the famous physician, professor and author of unusual
- [00:05] neurological case studies.
- [00:07] We’ll be looking at some of his fascinating research in future lessons, but for now, I
- [00:10] just want to talk about Sacks himself.
- [00:12] Although he possesses a brilliant and inquisitive mind, Dr. Sacks cannot do a simple thing that
- [00:17] your average toddler can.
- [00:19] He can’t recognize his own face in the mirror.
- [00:22] Sacks has a form of prosopagnosia, a neurological disorder that impairs a person’s ability
- [00:27] to perceive or recognize faces, also known as face blindness.
- [00:31] Last week we talked about how brain function is localized, and this is another peculiarly
- [00:35] excellent example of that.
- [00:37] Sacks can recognize his coffee cup on the shelf, but he can’t pick out his oldest
- [00:42] friend from a crowd, because the specific sliver of his brain responsible for facial
- [00:46] recognition is malfunctioning.
- [00:47] There’s nothing wrong with his vision.
- [00:49] The sense is intact.
- [00:50] The problem is with his perception, at least when it comes to recognizing faces.
- [00:54] Prosopagnosia is a good example of how sensing and perceiving are connected, but different.
- [00:59] Sensation is the bottom-up process by which our senses, like vision, hearing and smell,
- [01:04] receive and relay outside stimuli.
- [01:06] Perception, on the other hand, is the top-down way our brains organize and interpret that
- [01:11] information and put it into context.
- [01:13] So right now at this very moment, you’re probably receiving light from your screen
- [01:17] through your eyes, which will send the data of that sensation to your brain.
- [01:21] Perception meanwhile is your brain telling you that what you’re seeing is a diagram
- [01:24] explaining the difference between sensation and perception, which is pretty meta.
- [01:28] Now your brain is interpreting that light as a talking person, whom your brain might
- [01:32] additionally recognize as Hank.
- [01:39] [Intro]
- [01:44] We are constantly bombarded by stimuli even though we’re only aware of what our own
- [01:48] senses can pick up.
- [01:49] Like I can see and hear and feel and even smell this Corgi, but I can’t hunt using
- [01:54] sonar like a bat or hear a mole tunneling underground like an owl or see ultraviolet
- [01:59] and infrared light like a mantis shrimp.
- [02:02] I probably can’t even smell half of what you can smell.
- [02:05] No!
- [02:06] No!
- [02:07] We have different senses.
- [02:08] Mwah mwah mwah mwah mwah.
- [02:10] Yeah.
- [02:11] There’s a lot to sense in the world, and not everybody needs to sense all the same
- [02:15] stuff.
- [02:16] So every animal has its limitations which we can talk about more precisely if we define
- [02:20] the Absolute Threshold of Sensation, the minimum stimulation needed to register a particular
- [02:25] stimulus, 50% of the time.
- [02:27] So if I play a tiny little beep in your ear and you tell me that you hear it fifty percent
- [02:30] of the times that I play it, that’s your absolute threshold of sensation.
- [02:34] We have to use a percentage because sometimes I'll play the beep and you’ll hear it and
- [02:38] sometimes you won’t even though it’s the exact same volume.
- [02:40] Why?
- [02:41] Because brains are complicated.
- [02:43] Detecting a weak sensory signal like that beep in daily life isn’t only about the
- [02:46] strength of the stimulus.
- [02:48] It’s also about your psychological state; your alertness and expectations in the moment.
- [02:53] This has to do with Signal Detection Theory, a model for predicting how and when a person
- [02:58] will detect a weak stimuli, partly based on context.
- [03:01] Exhausted new parents might hear their baby’s tiniest whimper, but not even register the
- [03:06] bellow of a passing train.
- [03:08] Their paranoid parent brains are so trained on their baby, it gives their senses a sort
- [03:12] of boosted ability, but only in relation to the subject of their attention.
- [03:16] Conversely, if you’re experiencing constant stimulation, your senses will adjust in a
- [03:20] process called sensory adaptation.
- [03:22] It is the reason that I have to check and see if my wallet is there if it’s in my

- [03:57] Good girl.
- [03:58] The point at which one can tell the difference is the difference threshold, but it’s not
- [04:02] linear.
- [04:03] Like.
- [04:04] if a tiny star is just a tiny bit brighter than another tiny star, I can tell.
- [04:07] But if a big star is that same tiny amount brighter than another big star, I won’t
- [04:11] be able to tell the difference.
- [04:12] This is important enough that we gave the guy who discovered it a law.
- [04:15] Weber’s Law says that we perceive differences on a logarithmic, not a linear scale.

Homunculus! If you've heard that word, it probably wasn't in the context of psychology. A monster in Dungeons and Dragons, a song by They Might Be Giants, the bad guys in Fullmetal Alchemist, a novel by James Blaylock. It's Latin for 'little man' and in psychology, it refers to a kind of sensory map of the human body, a depiction of what we'd look like if each of our parts grew in proportion to how much we sense with them. Witness! Look at this dude. His ham hands could rip off a car door. I mean, if he could lift them, which he couldn't. Is this what we're supposed to look like on the inside? This freaky thing illustrates the weighted significance of our sensory receptors.

His disproportional hands are monstrous, for example, because we primarily touch the world with our hands, not our elbows, so our hands are extremely sensitive. His mouth, meanwhile, is huge because we also have a ton of sensory receptors in our tongues and lips. It's what we use for tasting food and for sucking face. As we continue our exploration of how we both sense and perceive the world, the Homunculus, while kind of freaky, is actually a pretty attractive model for understanding how our bodies interact with the environment. How we smell it with our outsized nose, taste it with our ridiculous Mick Jagger lips, and touch it with our enormous Donkey Kong hands. So join me, as we get to know the hideous little creature within you.

[Intro] Last week we talked about the difference between sensation and perception: how sensation is the process by which our senses and brain receive information from the outer world, while perception is how we organize and interpret that information and give it meaning. Like, right now, my sense of hearing is letting me detect sounds, while my brain is processing and interpreting them, allowing me to identify and perceive the individual sounds and determine if they're coming from the radio, or outside or right behind me. Sound moves in waves that vibrate through a medium, like air. And although they function differently that waves of electromagnetic radiation, including what we think of as light, sound waves also can vary in shape.

Short waves have a high frequency and a high pitch, like a plucky violin. Long waves have a low frequency and pitch, like a mournful cello. Wave height, or amplitude, determine a sound's loudness, which we typically measure in decibels. And just as light waves become electrical impulses that we register with our sight, so too do our ears turn vibrating air into signals that our brains can decipher. While the human ear might not be as elegant as the jackrabbit's, or as wild as the long-eared bat's, it's actually a pretty incredible organ. Or, organs, since we have two of them, which helps give us directional stereophonic hearing. That's the 3D type of hearing we couldn't experience if we had just one big, freaky ear in the middle of our foreheads.

Your outer ear, the part that you can see and pierce and tug on, collects sound waves and funnels through the ear canal and into the middle ear, where they cause your eardrum to vibrate. From there, sound vibrations are amplified by the so-called 'ossicle bones', which also happen to be the most awesomely named bones in your body: the stirrup, the hammer and the anvil. From here, those physical vibrations travel to the inner ear, where they bump into the snail-shaped cochlea, and its surrounding fluids get jostled around, causing some of your 16,000 tiny cochlear hair cells to bend. This motion triggers neighbouring nerve cells that convert that physical energy into electrical impulses zipping up the auditory nerve into the auditory cortex, where the brain is like

'Oh, songbirds!', or 'Elvis!', or 'Vengeance!', or whatever. And you know what goes great with a little bit of rockabilly, or revenge? A nice meal. One of the greatest joys in life is enjoying flavors; whether you prefer casserole or caviar, we all get our tasting done in the same way, starting with our taste buds. Each of our thousands of taste buds contains a sort of pocket-like pore that contains fifty to a hundred hair-like taste receptor cells that read food molecules and report back to the brain. "That chip is salty, that lemon is sour." Now, everybody used to think that our tongues just detected four distinct tastes: sweet, salty, sour and bitter. And you've probably seen the version of this bogus taste map, which incorrectly assigns certain tastes to certain parts of your tongue.

But we now recognize a fifth flavour: the savoury, meaty, MSG-y taste, for which there is no English word, it's known as 'umami'. But taste is nothing without smell. Plug your nose, and a bite of cold bacon is just a mouthful of salt. This is a prime example of sensory interaction; the principle that one sense can influence another. I'll get back to smell in just a bit, but I want to take a moment to talk about what happens when those sensory interactions get messy. Let us take a little questionnaire, shall we? Do certain words trigger a strong, specific taste in your mouth? Like, does the word 'kitten' taste like candy canes? Has hearing a sound ever made you see a color?

Like does Prince's voice singing Purple Rain actually cause the colour purple to flash before your eyes? Do you ever feel like you're being touched when you smell something? Like does the smell of lilies give you the sensation of touching a cold, metal surface? Most of you said no to all of those questions, but at least one of you out there answered yes. And more likely than not, that person has synesthesia, a rare and fascinating neurological condition where two or more senses get wrapped together. This kind of sensory mix up is involuntary, and it's experienced without forethought in a durable and consistent way. Like, the number seven is always going to taste like coffee, and it's never going to switch to tomato juice.

And we're still not sure what causes this phenomenon. One idea suggests that the rogue development of new neural connections may override normal boundaries that typically separate the senses. Another theory suggests that all babies are born with synesthesia and experience mixed sense until the brain matures and creates separate sense channels, unless they don't, in which case you grow up to be a synesthete. Yet another theory links the condition to wonky neurochemistry, in which the neurotransmitters associated with one function turn up way over in a different part of the brain. Just another example of how the mind is still extremely mysterious. So, back to the comparatively boring topic of smells that only smell...

unlike our wave detecting senses of sight and hearing, out taste and smell are chemical senses. We differentiate the smells of spring lilacs, grilled cheese, and gasoline when airborne molecules travel up the nose and reach the five to ten million receptor cells at the top of each nasal cavity; and yes, that means when you smell poop, there's poop particles in your nose. These receptors send information to the brain's olfactory bulb, then zips it on to the primary smell cortex and parts of the limbic system responsible for emotion and memory. Unlike our five different taste receptors or two types of retinal receptors, we don't have specifically differentiated smell receptors, rather, odour receptors come together in different combinations.

So, just like pressing different keys on your keyboard can allow you to form tons of different words, so too can these distinct combinations of activated smell receptors communicate some ten thousand unique smells. But, how we feel about a smell, and our perception of it, is often tangled up in our experiences with that scent. If our beloved grandma baked gingerbread every time we visited, those memories may make you partial to the smell of gingerbread. Even if we can't immediately name the odor, our brains are amazing at storing and recognizing old scents by their associations. Which is why you may suddenly feel happy when you walk into a bakery, even before you realize you're thinking of your grandma.

The emotional power of smell partly has to with how our sense circuitry connects to the brain's limbic system, right next to our emotional registry, the amygdala, and our memory keeper, the hippocampus. That's why scents can be so intimately tied with our feelings and memories. And how a whiff of Nag Champa can immediately transport to back to eating chips in your freshman dorm room. Smelling, hearing, tasting, seeing: all fantastic, but if there's one thing that popular music taught us, besides a bunch of really terrible relationship advice, it's that when it comes to our senses, we're all about touching. We've got songs about magic touches and golden touches, invisible and human touches.

Songs about touching ourselves, touching me, touching you, and even what you can't touch. Touch is extremely important, especially during early development. Baby monkeys that are allowed to see, hear and smell, but not touch their mamas become extremely distraught. That's just a mean experiment. Premature human babies gain weight faster if they're held and massaged, and some studies indicated that children that didn't receive enough physical attention as infants are at higher risk for emotional, behavioral, and social problems as they grow. Your sense of touch is actually a combination of four distinct skin sensations: pressure, warmth, cold, and pain. If you touch various spots of your skin with something soft like this anglerfish, you'll

feel that you sense different amounts of softness on different parts of your body... just put that up there... The same goes for a warm mug, or an ice cube, or a needle point. You'll sense that some spots are more or less sensitive to each of the four distinct sensations. Other skin sensations, like tickles, itches, and the experience of wetness, are just variations on those four different sensations. Ultimately, your sense of touch joins forces with sensors in your bones, joints, and tendons to provide your personal kinesthesis: the way that body senses its own movement and positioning. You use your kinesthetic sense whenever you walk, dance, swim, or hula hoop. It's what the cops are testing drunk people for when they ask them to touch their noses with their eyes closed.

This sense allows you to detect changes in the position of your body without relying on other senses, which is why you can still cha-cha, backstroke, and hula hoop with your eyes closed and your ears plugged. The partner sense to your kinesthesis is your vestibular sense, which monitors your head's position and your balance. This sense of equilibrium is ruled by the pretzel-shaped, semicircular canals and the fluid-filled vestibular sacs that connect those canals to the cochlea in your inner ear. So, if you spin around a bunch and suddenly stop, it'll take a minute for that inner ear fluid to return to normal, which is what makes you feel dizzy. That moving fluid is actually fooling your brain into thinking your body is still spinning.

It's a good example of how even our normal functioning senses can fool us. Understanding exactly how we get fooled helps us understand how our sensual perception system works, which is exactly what we're going to be talking about next time. For now, hopefully you realized that your homunculus is actually kinda beautiful, in its own way, because you learned how your sense of hearing, taste, smell, and touch work.

- [00:00] Homunculus!
- [00:01] If you've heard that word, it probably wasn't in the context of psychology.
- [00:05] A monster in Dungeons and Dragons, a song by They Might Be Giants, the bad guys in Fullmetal
- [00:09] Alchemist, a novel by James Blaylock.
- [00:11] It's Latin for 'little man' and in psychology, it refers to a kind of sensory map of the
- [00:16] human body, a depiction of what we'd look like if each of our parts grew in proportion
- [00:20] to how much we sense with them.
- [00:22] Witness!
- [00:23] Look at this dude.
- [00:24] His ham hands could rip off a car door.
- [00:25] I mean, if he could lift them, which he couldn't.
- [00:28] Is this what we're supposed to look like on the inside?
- [00:30] This freaky thing illustrates the weighted significance of our sensory receptors.
- [00:34] His disproportional hands are monstrous, for example, because we primarily touch the world
- [00:39] with our hands, not our elbows, so our hands are extremely sensitive.
- [00:43] His mouth, meanwhile, is huge because we also have a ton of sensory receptors in our tongues
- [00:48] and lips.
- [00:49] It's what we use for tasting food and for sucking face.
- [00:52] As we continue our exploration of how we both sense and perceive the world, the Homunculus,
- [00:56] while kind of freaky, is actually a pretty attractive model for understanding how our
- [00:59] bodies interact with the environment.
- [01:01] How we smell it with our outsized nose, taste it with our ridiculous Mick Jagger lips, and
- [01:06] touch it with our enormous Donkey Kong hands.
- [01:08] So join me, as we get to know the hideous little creature within you.
- [01:17] [Intro]
- [01:22] Last week we talked about the difference between sensation and perception: how sensation is
- [01:26] the process by which our senses and brain receive information from the outer world,
- [01:30] while perception is how we organize and interpret that information and give it meaning.
- [01:35] Like, right now, my sense of hearing is letting me detect sounds, while my brain is processing
- [01:40] and interpreting them, allowing me to identify and perceive the individual sounds and determine
- [01:45] if they're coming from the radio, or outside or right behind me.
- [01:49] Sound moves in waves that vibrate through a medium, like air.
- [01:52] And although they function differently that waves of electromagnetic radiation, including
- [01:56] what we think of as light, sound waves also can vary in shape.
- [01:59] Short waves have a high frequency and a high pitch, like a plucky violin.
- [02:04] Long waves have a low frequency and pitch, like a mournful cello.
- [02:07] Wave height, or amplitude, determine a sound's loudness, which we typically measure in decibels.
- [02:12] And just as light waves become electrical impulses that we register with our sight,
- [02:16] so too do our ears turn vibrating air into signals that our brains can decipher.
- [02:21] While the human ear might not be as elegant as the jackrabbit's, or as wild as the long-eared
- [02:25] bat's, it's actually a pretty incredible organ.
- [02:27] Or, organs, since we have two of them, which helps give us directional stereophonic hearing.
- [02:32] That's the 3D type of hearing we couldn't experience if we had just one big, freaky
- [02:36] ear in the middle of our foreheads.
- [02:38] Your outer ear, the part that you can see and pierce and tug on, collects sound waves
- [02:42] and funnels through the ear canal and into the middle ear, where they cause your eardrum
- [02:47] to vibrate.
- [02:48] From there, sound vibrations are amplified by the so-called 'ossicle bones', which also
- [02:52] happen to be the most awesomely named bones in your body: the stirrup, the hammer and
- [02:56] the anvil.
- [02:57] From here, those physical vibrations travel to the inner ear, where they bump into the
- [03:01] snail-shaped cochlea, and its surrounding fluids get jostled around, causing some of
- [03:05] your 16,000 tiny cochlear hair cells to bend.
- [03:09] This motion triggers neighbouring nerve cells that convert that physical energy into electrical
- [03:13] impulses zipping up the auditory nerve into the auditory cortex, where the brain is like
- [03:17] 'Oh, songbirds!', or 'Elvis!', or 'Vengeance!', or whatever.
- [03:21] And you know what goes great with a little bit of rockabilly, or revenge?
- [03:25] A nice meal.
- [03:26] One of the greatest joys in life is enjoying flavors; whether you prefer casserole or caviar,
- [03:31] we all get our tasting done in the same way, starting with our taste buds.
- [03:34] Each of our thousands of taste buds contains a sort of pocket-like pore that contains fifty
- [03:38] to a hundred hair-like taste receptor cells that read food molecules and report back to
- [03:43] the brain.
- [03:44] "That chip is salty, that lemon is sour."
- [03:47] Now, everybody used to think that our tongues just detected four distinct tastes: sweet,
- [03:51] salty, sour and bitter.
- [03:52] And you've probably seen the version of this bogus taste map, which incorrectly assigns
- [03:56] certain tastes to certain parts of your tongue.
- [03:59] But we now recognize a fifth flavour: the savoury, meaty, MSG-y taste, for which there
- [04:04] is no English word, it's known as 'umami'.
- [04:07] But taste is nothing without smell.
- [04:09] Plug your nose, and a bite of cold bacon is just a mouthful of salt.
- [04:13] This is a prime example of sensory interaction; the principle that one sense can influence
- [04:18] another.
- [04:19] I'll get back to smell in just a bit, but I want to take a moment to talk about what
- [04:21] happens when those sensory interactions get messy.
- [04:24] Let us take a little questionnaire, shall we?
- [04:26] Do certain words trigger a strong, specific taste in your mouth?
- [04:30] Like, does the word 'kitten' taste like candy canes?
- [04:33] Has hearing a sound ever made you see a color?
- [04:36] Like does Prince's voice singing Purple Rain actually cause the colour purple to flash
- [04:41] before your eyes?
- [04:42] Do you ever feel like you're being touched when you smell something?
- [04:45] Like does the smell of lilies give you the sensation of touching a cold, metal surface?
- [04:49] Most of you said no to all of those questions, but at least one of you out there answered
- [04:54] yes.
- [04:55] And more likely than not, that person has synesthesia, a rare and fascinating neurological
- [05:00] condition where two or more senses get wrapped together.
- [05:04] This kind of sensory mix up is involuntary, and it's experienced without forethought in
- [05:08] a durable and consistent way.
- [05:10] Like, the number seven is always going to taste like coffee, and it's never going to
- [05:15] switch to tomato juice.
- [05:16] And we're still not sure what causes this phenomenon.
- [05:18] One idea suggests that the rogue development of new neural connections may override normal
- [05:23] boundaries that typically separate the senses.
- [05:25] Another theory suggests that all babies are born with synesthesia and experience mixed
- [05:29] sense until the brain matures and creates separate sense channels, unless they don't,
- [05:33] in which case you grow up to be a synesthete.
- [05:36] Yet another theory links the condition to wonky neurochemistry, in which the neurotransmitters
- [05:40] associated with one function turn up way over in a different part of the brain.
- [05:44] Just another example of how the mind is still extremely mysterious.
- [05:48] So, back to the comparatively boring topic of smells that only smell...
- [05:53] unlike our wave detecting senses of sight and hearing, out taste and smell are chemical
- [05:57] senses.
- [05:58] We differentiate the smells of spring lilacs, grilled cheese, and gasoline when airborne
- [06:02] molecules travel up the nose and reach the five to ten million receptor cells at the
- [06:07] top of each nasal cavity; and yes, that means when you smell poop, there's poop particles
- [06:11] in your nose.
- [06:12] These receptors send information to the brain's olfactory bulb, then zips it on to the primary
- [06:17] smell cortex and parts of the limbic system responsible for emotion and memory.
- [06:21] Unlike our five different taste receptors or two types of retinal receptors, we don't
- [06:25] have specifically differentiated smell receptors, rather, odour receptors come together in different
- [06:31] combinations.
- [06:32] So, just like pressing different keys on your keyboard can allow you to form tons of different
- [06:35] words, so too can these distinct combinations of activated smell receptors communicate some
- [06:39] ten thousand unique smells.
- [06:41] But, how we feel about a smell, and our perception of it, is often tangled up in our experiences
- [06:45] with that scent.
- [06:46] If our beloved grandma baked gingerbread every time we visited, those memories may make you
- [06:51] partial to the smell of gingerbread.

- [06:57] old scents by their associations.
- [06:59] Which is why you may suddenly feel happy when you walk into a bakery, even before you realize
- [07:04] you're thinking of your grandma.

- [07:14] the hippocampus.
- [07:15] That's why scents can be so intimately tied with our feelings and memories.
- [07:19] And how a whiff of Nag Champa can immediately transport to back to eating chips in your
- [07:22] freshman dorm room.

### Transcript (reading)

Every rose has its thorn. Only the good die young. Slow and steady wins the race. And what you see is what you get. Except that in reality, several varieties of roses do not have thorns; both the good and the bad, on occasion, tragically die young; fast and steady beats slow and steady every time; and what you see is, well... Our perception, or how we order the cacophonous chaos of our environment, is heavily influenced, biased even, by our expectations, experiences, moods, and even cultural norms. And we can be pretty good at fooling ourselves. In the last two lessons, we've learned how we see shapes and colors, hear sounds, and smell and taste the world's chemical concoctions, but our senses mean little without our brain's ability to organize

and translate that data into meaningful perceptions. Without perception, your mother's face is just a combination of shapes. Without the ability to interpret scent, we couldn't differentiate the smell of toast from a grease fire. Our perception is the process that allows us to make meaning out of our senses and experience the world around us. it's what makes life understandable, but also it means that sometimes what you see is not actually what you get. [INTRO MUSIC] So that was awesome, right? Upside-down, I look like me. Right-side-up, I look like some kind of terrifying monster. Your brain isn't used to upside-down faces, so it's basically just doing its best to put the pieces together. But it knows exactly what a right-side-up face

should look like, and that is not it. Just one of thousands of examples proving that your brain does all the work of perception, and your eyes really are just feeding raw data. It's important data, but it isn't actually what we see. What we see is the realm of the mind, not the eye. What kind of bird do you see right now? A duck, right? But if I said, "What kind of mammal do you see?" a bunny probably would have popped out at you. Now, you should be seeing both of them popping back and forth, but likely your brain wants to perceive the image related to whichever cue you first heard, or whichever image is more familiar to you. By cueing "mammal" or "bird," I influenced your expectations and you saw what I wanted you to see. Pretty cool!

Your expectations are just one factor in your perceptual set: the psychological factors that determine how you perceive your environment. Sometimes, seeing is believing, but perceptual set theory teaches us that believing is also seeing. Context is another factor in your perceptual set. If the duck bunny thing was pictured with easter eggs all around it, you'd think bunny right away -- which is kind of weird, considering that of ducks and bunnies, one is actually much more likely to be near an egg (it's not the bunny). And that's an example of how culture is also an important part of our perceptual set. As much as our perceptions are affected by context and expectations, they're also swayed by our emotions and motivations. People will say a hill is more steep if they're

listening to emo by themselves than if they're listening to power pop and walking with a friend. Most of the time, your personal perceptual set leads you to reasonable conclusions, but sets can also be misleading or even harmful. They're the basis of tons of entertaining optical illusions. These two tables, for example, are the same size, but the positions of their legs make that impossible for you to believe until I lay them over each other. And while all the fooling of our visual perception can be fun, it also helps us understand how it works. Our minds are given a tremendous amount of information, especially through the eyes, and we need to make quick work of it. Turning marks on a paper into words; blobby lumps into the face of a friend;

seeing depth, color, movement, and contrast; being able to pick out an object from all the other clutter around it seems so simple, but we've come to discover that it is quite complicated. So complicated that we have a name for it: form perception. Take a neat little dynamic called the "figure-ground relationship." It's how we organize and simplify whatever scene we're looking at into the main objects or figures and the surroundings or ground that they stand out against. The classic "faces or vases" illusion is an example. Is it two faces against a white background, or a vase against a black background? If you look long enough, you'll see that the relationship between the object and its surroundings flip back and forth, continually reversing, sometimes white

is the figure and black is the ground. That figure-ground dynamic, though, is always there. The concept applies to non-visual fields as well. Say you're at a party, holding up the wall and creeping on your crush across the room, trying to casually listen in on what they're saying. As the focus of your attention, that voice becomes the figure, while all the other voices jabbering about sports and beer pong and Sherlock and everything that doesn't have to do with that one beautiful person all becomes the ground. Now that your mind has distinguished figure from ground, it has to perceive that form as something meaningful. Like for one, that large shape on the couch is a person, and further, that person isn't just any person, but the

specific unique person of your dreams. One way our minds shuffle all of these stimuli into something coherent is by following rules of grouping, like organizing things by proximity, continuity, or closure. The rule of proximity, for instance, simply states that we like to group nearby figures together. So instead of seeing a random garble of partygoers, we tend to mentally connect people standing next to each other. Like, there's the hockey team over there, and the debate team over there, and then you've got the band geeks -- why are all these people at the same party? We're also drawn to organize our world with attention to continuity, perceiving smooth, continuous patterns, and often ignoring broken ones. We also like closure -- and not just after a breakup. Visually, we want

to fill in gaps to create whole objects. So here, we see an illusory triangle breaking the completion of these circles on the left. But just add the little lines, close up the circles, and you stop seeing the triangle. Form perception is obviously crucial to making sense of the world, or, y'know, a moderately interesting party. But imagine trying to navigate the world without depth perception. As you gaze upon your one true love, the image hits your retina in two dimensions. Yet somehow, you're still able to see the full three-dimensional gloriousness of their form. You can thank your depth perception for that! Depth perception is what helps us estimate an object's distance and full shape. In this case, a nice shape that is

currently too far away from you. It is at least partially innate -- even most babies have it. We're able to perceive depth by using both binocular and monocular visual cues. Binocular cues, as the name gives away, require the use of both eyes. Because your eyes are about 2.5 inches apart, your retinas receive ever-so-slightly different images. You know, camera one, camera two. So when you're looking with both your eyes, your brain compares the two images to help judge distance. The closer the object, the greater the difference between the two images, also known as the retinal disparity. Retinal disparity is pretty easy to see, you just hold your fingers up, and then you look past them, and suddenly you have four instead of two fingers. Because those left and right images vary only

slightly, retinal disparity doesn't help much when it comes to judging far-off distances. For that, we look to monocular cues to help us determine the scale and distance of an object. These are things like relative size and height, linear perspective, texture gradient, and interposition. Relative size allows you to determine that your crush is not supporting a tiny newborn chihuahua on their shoulder, but rather, there's a full-grown chihuahua behind them in the back of the room. In the absence of a chihuahua (or like object), you can also judge distances using your linear perspective. If you've ever made a perspective drawing in art class, you'll remember that parallel lines appear to meet as they move into the distance. Just like the tiled floor,

the sharper the angle of convergence, and the closer the lines together, the greater the distance will seem. And if you've ever looked out at a mountain range or a Bob Ross painting, you'll understand texture gradient as the cue that makes the first ridge appear all rocky and textured, but as your eye follows the ridges into the distance, they become less detailed. And finally, our interposition, or overlap, cue tells us when one object, like this oaf here, blocks our view of something else, your crush, we perceive it as being closer. And in this case, especially annoying. So all these perceptual concepts can be demonstrated with a fixed image, but of course, life involves a lot of movement. At least if you're doing it right.

We use motion perception to infer speed and direction of a moving object. Like, your brain gauges motion based partly on the idea that shrinking objects are retreating and enlarging objects are approaching. The thing is, your brain is easily tricked when it comes to motion. For instance, large objects appear to move much more slowly than small ones going the same speed. And in addition to organizing things by form, depth, and motion, our perception of the world also requires consistency. Or as psychologists call it, constancy. Perceptual constancy is what allows us to continue to recognize an object, regardless of its distance, viewing angle, motion, or illumination, even as it might appear to change color, size, shape, and brightness, depending on the

conditions. Like, we know what a chihuahua looks like, whether it looks like this this, this, or this. In the end, though, your perception isn't just about funky optical illusions. It's about how you understand the world and your place in it, both physically and psychologically. Your sensory organs pull in the world's raw data, which is disassembled into little bits of information and then reassembled in your brain to form your own model of the world. It's like your senses are just collecting a bunch of Legos and your brain can build and rebuild whatever it perceives. A party, your crush, a duck, or a chihuahua. In other words, your brain constructs your perceptions. And if you were correctly constructing your perceptions this lesson,

you learned what forms your perceptual set, how form perception works, and the many visual cues that influence your depth perception.

- [00:01] Every rose has its thorn. Only the good die young. Slow and steady wins the race.
- [00:06] And what you see is what you get. Except that in
- [00:09] reality, several varieties  of roses do not have thorns;
- [00:12] both the good and the bad, on occasion, tragically die young; fast and steady beats slow and steady
- [00:18] every time; and what you see is, well... Our perception, or how we order the cacophonous
- [00:25] chaos of our environment, is heavily influenced, biased even, by our expectations, experiences,
- [00:32] moods, and even cultural norms. And we can be pretty good at fooling ourselves. In the last two
- [00:37] lessons, we've learned how we see shapes and colors, hear sounds, and smell and taste the
- [00:42] world's chemical concoctions, but our senses
- [00:45] mean little without our  brain's ability to organize
- [00:48] and translate that data  into meaningful perceptions.
- [00:51] Without perception, your mother's face is just a
- [00:54] combination of shapes. Without the ability to interpret scent, we couldn't differentiate the
- [00:58] smell of toast from a grease fire. Our perception is the process that allows us to make meaning
- [01:03] out of our senses and experience the world around us. it's what makes life understandable,
- [01:08] but also it means that sometimes what you see is not actually what you get.
- [01:13] [INTRO MUSIC]
- [01:22] So that was awesome, right? Upside-down, I look like me. Right-side-up, I look like some
- [01:27] kind of terrifying monster. Your brain isn't used to upside-down faces, so it's basically
- [01:31] just doing its best to put the pieces together. But it knows exactly what a right-side-up face
- [01:35] should look like, and that is not it. Just one of thousands of examples proving that your brain
- [01:42] does all the work of perception, and your eyes really are just feeding raw data. It's important
- [01:48] data, but it isn't actually what we see. What we see is the realm of the mind, not the eye.
- [01:54] What kind of bird do you see right now? A duck, right? But if I said, "What kind of mammal do you
- [01:58] see?" a bunny probably would have popped out at you. Now, you should be seeing both of them
- [02:03] popping back and forth, but likely your brain wants to perceive the image related to
- [02:07] whichever cue you first heard, or whichever image is more familiar to you. By cueing
- [02:11] "mammal" or "bird," I influenced your expectations and you saw what I wanted you to see. Pretty cool!
- [02:18] Your expectations are just one factor in your perceptual set: the psychological factors that
- [02:23] determine how you perceive your environment. Sometimes, seeing is believing, but perceptual
- [02:28] set theory teaches us that believing is also seeing. Context is another factor in your
- [02:33] perceptual set. If the duck bunny thing was pictured with easter eggs all around it,
- [02:37] you'd think bunny right away -- which is kind of weird, considering that of ducks
- [02:41] and bunnies, one is actually much more likely to be near an egg (it's not the bunny).
- [02:46] And that's an example of how culture is also an important part of our perceptual set.
- [02:50] As much as our perceptions are affected by context and expectations, they're also
- [02:53] swayed by our emotions and motivations. People will say a hill is more steep if they're
- [02:58] listening to emo by themselves than if they're listening to power pop and walking with a friend.
- [03:02] Most of the time, your personal perceptual set leads you to reasonable conclusions, but sets
- [03:07] can also be misleading or even harmful. They're
- [03:10] the basis of tons of  entertaining optical illusions.
- [03:13] These two tables, for example, are the same size,
- [03:15] but the positions of their  legs make that impossible
- [03:18] for you to believe until I  lay them over each other.
- [03:20] And while all the fooling of our visual perception
- [03:23] can be fun, it also helps  us understand how it works.
- [03:26] Our minds are given a tremendous amount of
- [03:29] information, especially  through the eyes, and we need
- [03:32] to make quick work of it. Turning marks on a paper
- [03:35] into words; blobby lumps  into the face of a friend;
- [03:38] seeing depth, color, movement, and contrast;
- [03:40] being able to pick out an  object from all the other
- [03:43] clutter around it seems so simple, but we've come
- [03:45] to discover that it is quite  complicated. So complicated
- [03:48] that we have a name for it:  form perception. Take a neat
- [03:51] little dynamic called the  "figure-ground relationship."
- [03:54] It's how we organize and simplify whatever scene
- [03:56] we're looking at into the main objects or figures and the surroundings or ground that they stand
- [04:01] out against. The classic "faces or vases" illusion is an example. Is it two faces against a white
- [04:06] background, or a vase against a black background?
- [04:08] If you look long enough, you'll  see that the relationship
- [04:10] between the object and its surroundings flip back and forth, continually reversing, sometimes white
- [04:16] is the figure and black is  the ground. That figure-ground
- [04:19] dynamic, though, is always  there. The concept applies
- [04:21] to non-visual fields as  well. Say you're at a party,
- [04:24] holding up the wall and creeping on your crush
- [04:26] across the room, trying to  casually listen in on what
- [04:29] they're saying. As the focus  of your attention, that voice
- [04:31] becomes the figure, while all  the other voices jabbering
- [04:34] about sports and beer pong  and Sherlock and everything
- [04:37] that doesn't have to do with  that one beautiful person
- [04:39] all becomes the ground. Now that your mind has
- [04:41] distinguished figure from  ground, it has to perceive
- [04:44] that form as something meaningful. Like for one,
- [04:46] that large shape on the couch is a person, and
- [04:49] further, that person isn't  just any person, but the
- [04:51] specific unique person of your dreams. One way our minds shuffle all of these stimuli into
- [04:55] something coherent is by  following rules of grouping,
- [04:58] like organizing things by  proximity, continuity, or closure.
- [05:02] The rule of proximity, for  instance, simply states that
- [05:04] we like to group nearby  figures together. So instead of
- [05:07] seeing a random garble of partygoers, we tend to
- [05:09] mentally connect people  standing next to each other.
- [05:12] Like, there's the hockey team over there, and the debate team over there, and then you've got the
- [05:15] band geeks -- why are all these people at the same party? We're also drawn to organize our world with
- [05:19] attention to continuity,  perceiving smooth, continuous
- [05:22] patterns, and often ignoring  broken ones. We also like
- [05:25] closure -- and not just after  a breakup. Visually, we want
- [05:28] to fill in gaps to create  whole objects. So here, we see
- [05:32] an illusory triangle breaking  the completion of these
- [05:35] circles on the left. But just  add the little lines, close up
- [05:38] the circles, and you stop  seeing the triangle. Form
- [05:40] perception is obviously crucial to making sense
- [05:43] of the world, or, y'know, a  moderately interesting party.
- [05:46] But imagine trying to navigate the world without
- [05:48] depth perception. As you  gaze upon your one true love,
- [05:51] the image hits your retina in  two dimensions. Yet somehow,
- [05:54] you're still able to see  the full three-dimensional
- [05:57] gloriousness of their form. You can thank your
- [06:00] depth perception for that! Depth perception is what helps us estimate an object's distance
- [06:04] and full shape. In this case, a nice shape that is
- [06:07] currently too far away from  you. It is at least partially
- [06:10] innate -- even most babies  have it. We're able to perceive
- [06:12] depth by using both binocular  and monocular visual cues.
- [06:16] Binocular cues, as the name  gives away, require the use
- [06:20] of both eyes. Because your eyes  are about 2.5 inches apart,
- [06:23] your retinas receive  ever-so-slightly different images.
- [06:26] You know, camera one, camera two. So when you're
- [06:28] looking with both your eyes, your brain compares the two images to help judge distance. The closer
- [06:32] the object, the greater the difference between the two images, also known as the retinal disparity.
- [06:37] Retinal disparity is pretty  easy to see, you just hold
- [06:39] your fingers up, and then you look past them, and
- [06:41] suddenly you have four instead of two fingers. Because those left and right images vary only
- [06:46] slightly, retinal disparity doesn't help much when it comes to judging far-off distances.
- [06:50] For that, we look to monocular cues to help us determine the scale and distance of an object.
- [06:55] These are things like relative  size and height, linear
- [06:58] perspective, texture gradient, and interposition.
- [07:01] Relative size allows you to determine that your crush is not supporting a tiny newborn chihuahua
- [07:06] on their shoulder, but  rather, there's a full-grown
- [07:08] chihuahua behind them in the back of the room.
- [07:10] In the absence of a chihuahua  (or like object), you
- [07:13] can also judge distances  using your linear perspective.
- [07:16] If you've ever made a  perspective drawing in art class,
- [07:17] you'll remember that parallel lines appear to meet
- [07:20] as they move into the distance.  Just like the tiled floor,
- [07:23] the sharper the angle of  convergence, and the closer
- [07:25] the lines together, the  greater the distance will seem.
- [07:27] And if you've ever looked out at a mountain range
- [07:29] or a Bob Ross painting, you'll understand texture gradient as the cue that makes the first ridge
- [07:34] appear all rocky and textured, but as your eye follows the ridges into the distance, they become
- [07:38] less detailed. And finally,  our interposition, or overlap,
- [07:42] cue tells us when one object, like this oaf here,
- [07:44] blocks our view of something else, your crush, we perceive it as being closer. And in this case,
- [07:50] especially annoying. So all these perceptual concepts can be demonstrated with a fixed
- [07:53] image, but of course, life involves a lot of movement. At least if you're doing it right.
- [07:57] We use motion perception to infer speed and direction of a moving object.
- [08:01] Like, your brain gauges motion based partly on the idea that shrinking objects are
- [08:05] retreating and enlarging objects are approaching. The thing is, your brain
- [08:08] is easily tricked when it comes to motion. For instance, large objects appear to move
- [08:12] much more slowly than small ones going the same speed. And in addition to organizing
- [08:16] things by form, depth, and motion, our perception of the world also requires consistency. Or as
- [08:22] psychologists call it, constancy. Perceptual constancy is what allows us to continue
- [08:26] to recognize an object, regardless of its distance, viewing angle, motion, or illumination,
- [08:31] even as it might appear to change color, size, shape, and brightness, depending on the
- [08:35] conditions. Like, we know what a chihuahua looks like, whether it looks like this this,
- [08:40] this, or this. In the end, though, your perception
- [08:41] isn't just about funky  optical illusions. It's about
- [08:44] how you understand the world and your place in it, both physically and psychologically.
- [08:49] Your sensory organs pull in the world's raw data,
- [08:52] which is disassembled into  little bits of information
- [08:54] and then reassembled in your brain to form your own model of the world. It's like your senses
- [09:00] are just collecting a bunch  of Legos and your brain
- [09:02] can build and rebuild whatever it perceives.
- [09:05] A party, your crush, a duck, or a chihuahua. In other words, your brain constructs
- [09:11] your perceptions. And if you were correctly constructing your perceptions this lesson,
- [09:15] you learned what forms your perceptual set, how form perception works, and the many
- [09:19] visual cues that influence your depth perception. Thank you for watching, especially to all of our

### Transcript (reading)

Here’s a riddle, my Hobbitses: What’s something we all experience, all the time, that we can’t really measure, and barely have words to define? You can’t hold it in your hand, or take a bite out of it. It isn’t something you learn or practice; it just IS. Consciousness. Every science has certain concepts that are so fundamental, yet abstract, that we have a hard time finding the appropriate words to describe them. Ask a physicist and they’ll tell you energy and space defy simple definitions. Biologists know if something is alive, but have a harder time explaining what life actually is. Ask a psychologist what consciousness is, and you’ll get…you’ll get a slippery answer.

For the purposes of this conversation, we’re going to actually loosely define consciousness as our awareness of ourselves and our environment. It’s this awareness that allows us to take in and organize information from many sources and senses, at once. American psychologist William James thought of consciousness as a continuously moving, shifting, and unbroken stream, hence the term “stream of consciousness.” Others think of it as the brain’s roving flashlight, shining down an unbroken beam of light that highlights one thing, and then moves on to the next. The point is, your conscious experience is forever shifting--for example, right now hopefully you’re focused on the words coming out of my mouth, but with a little shift - your mind

might wander to how you really should shower today, and your chair is uncomfortable, and you suddenly have to pee, and can you believe what Bernice said?! Do I smell pizza? HEY! EYES HERE! WE’RE LEARNING! Beyond that moment-to-moment shifting, consciousness allows us to contemplate life, think about infinity, and ride a unicycle across a tightrope while juggling melons, at least in theory. Our consciousness helps us plan our futures, consider consequences, and reflect on the past. It is both the most familiar, and the most mysterious part of our lives. It’s kind of like The Force -- but for the little universes inside our heads. [INTRO] Throughout our daily lives we flit back and forth between various states of consciousness, including waking, sleeping, and various altered states.

These can occur spontaneously, like dreaming, or be physiologically sparked, like a drug-induced hallucination, or be triggered psychologically, through meditation or hypnosis, for example. We’re going to take the next three episodes to look closely at these different states of consciousness, but let’s start with what it really means to be awake. For centuries, scientists learned what they could about the brain solely through clinical observation. And they learned a lot, for sure, but with today’s technology, we’re actually able to see some of the structures and activity inside a living, working brain - its electrical, metabolic, and magnetic signatures displayed on screens for our wonder and amusement.

The field of cognitive neuroscience is the study of how brain activity is linked with our mental processes, including thinking, perception, memory, and language. Like other kinds of neuroscience, it uses neuroimaging technologies to consider links between specific brain states and conscious experiences. And there’s more than one way to scan a brain. Structural imaging shows the brain’s anatomy, and is useful in identifying large-scale tumors, diseases, and injuries. In contrast, functional imaging shows us electromagnetic or metabolic activity in the brain, like blood flow, to let us observe correlations between specific mental functions and activity in particular brain areas.

So, yes, neuroimaging has been revolutionizing the field of psychology, much like telescopes and microscopes did for astronomy and biology. But on the other hand, some of this technology is very new, and there’s plenty of disagreement about how to interpret neuroimaging findings. Remember, correlation does not equal causation. So, activity in a certain brain region while having certain kinds of thoughts might be useful to know, but it’s not the end of the conversation. We’ve already talked a lot about how function is often localized in the brain and how everything psychological is simultaneously biological--so it stands to reason our thoughts and emotions could in part be illustrated by a bright flare on a dark screen.

We’ve also collected a fair amount of evidence that we don’t just have one layer of consciousness - a single tape playing various tunes - but rather, something more like two layers, each supported by its own personal bio-psycho-social pit crew. I’m talking about one of the dual process models of consciousness--the idea that our conscious, deliberate mind could be saying, look! a squirrel! while our implicit, automatic mind is simultaneously subprocessing like a computer: color: brown, tail: bushy, movement: climbing, distance: 20 meters, association: my sister had a squirrel phobia as a child, implicit bias: I think that squirrels are ruining America. All of which might weigh upon my behavior upon seeing the little guy.

By some estimates, all your senses are scooping up nearly 11 million bits of information, EVERY SECOND. And yet, you consciously register only about 40 at time. So how do we keep focused and filter out all the chatter to actually get stuff done? With selective attention, of course! Selective attention is how we focus our consciousness on one particular stimulus or group of stimuli, effectively tuning out the rest. Your consciousness is like a spotlight on a busy stage. There are other things going on around you that your automatic, subprocessor brain is covertly registering. But for those moments when you shine your spotlight, most of the other stimuli fall away. Try it at home!

Right now, you’re consciously watching this lesson on consciousness. You probably don’t notice the feel of your socks on your feet, or the tongue that’s inside your mouth, always filling up your mouth with tongue! But as soon as I mention it, the spotlight of your attention turns to them, you feel those socks on your feet, and you’re like wow! It’s weird that there’s a tongue in my mouth! The classic auditory example of selective attention is the cocktail party effect. You could be in a room with 47 people jabbering away, and yet be able to concentrate your hearing on one conversation, tuning out the rest of the voices and background music. But, if the couple next to you were to speak your name, suddenly your cognitive radar would

light up and your attention would whip around to the sound of your name, probably trying to figure out if Bernice was talking behind your back again. Bernice!! This roving spotlight of selective attention is pretty handy most of the time, for spies and laypeople alike. But it can also be dangerous, if you’re being dumb, and say, texting and driving. When you shift your primary selective attention from driving to OMG, LOLOLOLOLOL, you also unwittingly activate your selective inattention, which means that you failed to see that cyclist who you almost ran over, which would not only have ruined her life but also yours so DON’T TEXT AND DRIVE! In fact, when your full attention is directed elsewhere, you’d be astounded by the scope of obvious things you fail to notice.

It’s called inattentional blindness. You may have even already been subject to one of the most famous experiments of inattentional blindness...the Invisible Gorilla or, sometimes, the Moonwalking bear. Just google either of those things if you want to be tested on your awareness and then come back. Pretty great, right?! Given the prompt to count the number of passes one team makes, your consciousness is focused on following the players and the ball, nothing else. You don’t see the players in black, they’re the distraction... also you certainly don’t see the dancing gorilla...or bear...whichever one. The original version of this experiment found that about 50% of people didn’t notice that there was A GORILLA WALKING THROUGH THE ROOM!

THAT is how powerfully selective our attention can be. Something to remember next time you’re behind the wheel. But you know who understands and exploits inattentional blindness better than anyone? Magicians! Except they call it misdirection. Famous modern magician Teller, of Penn and Teller, says “Every time you perform a magic trick you’re engaging in a experimental psychology.” And we can’t help but be rubes. Magicians also prey on our change blindness, the psychological phenomenon in which we fail to notice changes in our environment. And no, I don’t mean climate change. I mean the failure to recognize the difference between what was there a moment ago, versus what is there now.

For example, I have changed shirts several times since this lesson started. In a well-known and often-copied experiment, sometimes called the “person swap,” an experimenter will stop someone in a park and ask for directions. And then, during some staged interruption, the original experimenter will leave and be replaced with a totally different person. Half the time, the subject doesn’t even notice. Fun! One of the many perks of studying psychology with me is you learn all kinds of new ways to mess with people! But while change blindness makes for some really cool parlor tricks, this failure to notice certain things can be dangerous -- say, faulty memories lead to false eyewitness testimonies in court, or when friends get deadlocked in a he-said, she-said disagreement.

So, my friends, use The Force. But use it wisely. As one of my favorite psychologists once advised: “A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack.” Actually, that was Yoda. Anyway, the bottom line is, we are far less aware of what’s going on around us than we think we are. And that’s just when we’re awake! Imagine what might slip your notice when you’re half-asleep, drunk, hypnotized, or hallucinating! That’s what we’re gonna talk about next time. Thanks for watching this episode of Crash Course, if you were selectively conscious of my words, you got introduced the our constant struggle to define consciousness, learned a little bit about neuroimaging and its developing role in psychological science, how our consciousness

is split into two pieces, deliberate and automatic, and how the brain can be selectively attentive, selectively inattentive, and blind to changes in some surprisingly major ways.

- [03:31] useful to know, but it’s not the end of the conversation.
- [03:34] We’ve already talked a lot about how function is often localized in the brain and how everything
- [03:37] psychological is simultaneously biological--so it stands to reason our thoughts and emotions
- [03:42] could in part be illustrated by a bright flare on a dark screen.
- [03:46] We’ve also collected a fair amount of evidence that we don’t just have one layer of consciousness
- [03:50] - a single tape playing various tunes - but rather, something more like two layers, each
- [03:54] supported by its own personal bio-psycho-social pit crew.
- [03:59] I’m talking about one of the dual process models of consciousness--the idea that our
- [04:03] conscious, deliberate mind could be saying, look!
- [04:05] a squirrel!
- [04:06] while our implicit, automatic mind is simultaneously subprocessing like a computer: color: brown,
- [04:11] tail: bushy, movement: climbing, distance: 20 meters, association: my sister had a squirrel
- [04:15] phobia as a child, implicit bias: I think that squirrels are ruining America.
- [04:20] All of which might weigh upon my behavior upon seeing the little guy.
- [04:23] By some estimates, all your senses are scooping up nearly 11 million bits of information,
- [04:28] EVERY SECOND.
- [04:29] And yet, you consciously register only about 40 at time.
- [04:33] So how do we keep focused and filter out all the chatter to actually get stuff done?
- [04:38] With selective attention, of course!
- [04:40] Selective attention is how we focus our consciousness on one particular stimulus or group of stimuli,
- [04:45] effectively tuning out the rest.
- [04:46] Your consciousness is like a spotlight on a busy stage.
- [04:49] There are other things going on around you that your automatic, subprocessor brain is
- [04:52] covertly registering.
- [04:54] But for those moments when you shine your spotlight, most of the other stimuli fall
- [04:58] away.
- [04:59] Try it at home!
- [05:00] Right now, you’re consciously watching this lesson on consciousness.
- [05:03] You probably don’t notice the feel of your socks on your feet, or the tongue that’s
- [05:08] inside your mouth, always filling up your mouth with tongue!
- [05:11] But as soon as I mention it, the spotlight of your attention turns to them, you feel
- [05:16] those socks on your feet, and you’re like wow!
- [05:18] It’s weird that there’s a tongue in my mouth!
- [05:21] The classic auditory example of selective attention is the cocktail party effect.
- [05:24] You could be in a room with 47 people jabbering away, and yet be able to concentrate your
- [05:29] hearing on one conversation, tuning out the rest of the voices and background music.
- [05:34] But, if the couple next to you were to speak your name, suddenly your cognitive radar would
- [05:39] light up and your attention would whip around to the sound of your name, probably trying
- [05:44] to figure out if Bernice was talking behind your back again.
- [05:47] Bernice!!
- [05:48] This roving spotlight of selective attention is pretty handy most of the time, for spies
- [05:51] and laypeople alike.
- [05:53] But it can also be dangerous, if you’re being dumb, and say, texting and driving.
- [05:56] When you shift your primary selective attention from driving to OMG, LOLOLOLOLOL, you also
- [06:02] unwittingly activate your selective inattention, which means that you failed to see that cyclist
- [06:06] who you almost ran over, which would not only have ruined her life but also yours so DON’T
- [06:12] TEXT AND DRIVE!
- [06:13] In fact, when your full attention is directed elsewhere, you’d be astounded by the scope
- [06:17] of obvious things you fail to notice.
- [06:19] It’s called inattentional blindness.
- [06:21] You may have even already been subject to one of the most famous experiments of inattentional
- [06:26] blindness...the Invisible Gorilla or, sometimes, the Moonwalking bear.
- [06:30] Just google either of those things if you want to be tested on your awareness and then
- [06:34] come back.
- [06:37] Pretty great, right?!
- [06:42] Given the prompt to count the number of passes one team makes, your consciousness is focused
- [06:46] on following the players and the ball, nothing else.
- [06:49] You don’t see the players in black, they’re the distraction...
- [06:53] also you certainly don’t see the dancing gorilla...or bear...whichever one.
- [06:56] The original version of this experiment found that about 50% of people didn’t notice that
- [07:01] there was A GORILLA WALKING THROUGH THE ROOM!
- [07:03] THAT is how powerfully selective our attention can be.
- [07:06] Something to remember next time you’re behind the wheel.
- [07:08] But you know who understands and exploits inattentional blindness better than anyone?
- [07:12] Magicians!
- [07:13] Except they call it misdirection.
- [07:15] Famous modern magician Teller, of Penn and Teller, says “Every time you perform a magic
- [07:19] trick you’re engaging in a experimental psychology.”
- [07:22] And we can’t help but be rubes.
- [07:24] Magicians also prey on our change blindness, the psychological phenomenon in which we fail
- [07:28] to notice changes in our environment.
- [07:29] And no, I don’t mean climate change.
- [07:31] I mean the failure to recognize the difference between what was there a moment ago, versus
- [07:35] what is there now.
- [07:36] For example, I have changed shirts several times since this lesson started.
- [07:40] In a well-known and often-copied experiment, sometimes called the “person swap,” an
- [07:44] experimenter will stop someone in a park and ask for directions.
- [07:47] And then, during some staged interruption, the original experimenter will leave and be
- [07:51] replaced with a totally different person.
- [07:54] Half the time, the subject doesn’t even notice.
- [07:57] Fun!
- [07:58] One of the many perks of studying psychology with me is you learn all kinds of new ways
- [08:00] to mess with people!
- [08:01] But while change blindness makes for some really cool parlor tricks, this failure to
- [08:05] notice certain things can be dangerous -- say, faulty memories lead to false eyewitness testimonies
- [08:10] in court, or when friends get deadlocked in a he-said, she-said disagreement.
- [08:14] So, my friends, use The Force.
- [08:16] But use it wisely.
- [08:17] As one of my favorite psychologists once advised: “A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and
- [08:22] defense, never for attack.”
- [08:23] Actually, that was Yoda.
- [08:25] Anyway, the bottom line is, we are far less aware of what’s going on around us than
- [08:29] we think we are.
- [08:30] And that’s just when we’re awake!
- [08:31] Imagine what might slip your notice when you’re half-asleep, drunk, hypnotized, or hallucinating!
- [08:36] That’s what we’re gonna talk about next time.
- [08:38] Thanks for watching this episode of Crash Course, if you were selectively conscious
- [08:41] of my words, you got introduced the our constant struggle to define consciousness, learned
- [08:46] a little bit about neuroimaging and its developing role in psychological science, how our consciousness
- [08:50] is split into two pieces, deliberate and automatic, and how the brain can be selectively attentive,

Comedian Mike Birbiglia was having trouble with sleep. Though not with the actual sleeping part -- one night, while staying in a hotel, he dreamed that a guided missile was on its way to his bed, and in his dream, he jumped out the window to escape it. Unfortunately, he also did this not in his dream. From the second floor. And the window was not open. This little episode cost him 33 stitches and a trip to a sleep specialist. Mike now sleeps in zipped-up mummy bags for his own safety. The lesson here? Sleep is not some break time when your brain, or your body, just goes dormant. Far from it. In truth, sleep is just another state of consciousness. And only in the past few decades have we begun to really plumb its depths -- from why we

sleep in the first place, to what goes on in our brains when we do, to what happens when we can’t sleep. And there is a lot that science has to say about your dreams! Talk about weird! It’s like Sigmund Freud meets Neil Gaiman. So, even though it may seem like you’re dead to the world, when you sleep, your perceptual window remains slightly open. And kinda like Mike Birbiglia’s hotel room window, a trip through it can make for a pretty wild ride. But for your safety and enjoyment, I’m here to guide you through this state of consciousness, where you’ll learn more than a few things about human mind, including your own. And here’s hoping you won’t need any stitches when we’re through.

[INTRO] Technically speaking, sleep is a periodic, natural, reversible and near total loss of consciousness, meaning it’s different than hibernation, being in a coma, or in say, an anesthetic oblivion. Although we spend about a third of our lives sleeping, and we know that it’s essential to our health and survival, there still isn’t a scientific consensus for why we do it. Part of it probably has to do with simple recuperation, allowing our neurons and other cells to rest and repair themselves. Sleep also supports growth, because that’s when our pituitary glands release growth hormones, which is why babies sleep all the time. Plus, sleep has all kinds of benefits for mental function, like improving memory, giving

our brains time to process the events of the day, and boosting our creativity. But even if we’re not quite sure of all the reasons why we sleep, technology has given us great insight into how we sleep. And for that we can thank little Armond Aserinsky. One night in early 1950s Chicago, eight-year-old Armond was tucked into his bed by his father. But this night, instead of getting a kiss on the forehead, little Armond got some electrodes taped to his face. Armond’s dad was Eugene Aserinsky, a grad student looking to test out a new electroencephalograph, or EEG machine, that measures the brain’s electrical activity. That night, as his son slept peacefully, he watched the machine go bonkers with brain

wave patterns, and -- after making sure that his machine wasn’t somehow broken -- discovered that the brain doesn’t just "power down" during sleep, as most scientists thought. Instead, he had discovered the sleep stage we now call REM or rapid eye movement, a perplexing period when the sleeping brain is buzzing with activity, even though the body is in a deep slumber. Aserinsky and his colleague Nathaniel Kleitman went on to become pioneers of sleep research. Since then, sleep specialists armed with similar technology have shown that we experience four distinct stages of sleep, each defined by unique brainwave patterns. Say you’re just going to bed. All day your endocrine system has been releasing “awake” hormones like cortisol.

But with nightfall comes the release of sleepy melatonin hormones from the pineal gland. Your brain is relaxed, but still awake, a level of activity that EEGs measure as alpha waves. You’re feeling sleepy, your breath slows, and suddenly you’re asleep. This exact moment is clearly evident on an EEG reading, as those alpha waves immediately transition to the irregular non-Rapid Eye Movement stage one (NREM-1) waves. It’s in this first stage of sleep you might experience hypnagogic sensations -- those brief moments when you feel like you’re falling, and your body jerks, startling you. As you relax more deeply, you move into NREM-2 stage sleep, as your brain starts exhibiting bursts of rapid brain wave activity called sleep spindles.

You’re now definitely asleep, but you could still be easily awakened. NREM-3 comes with slow rolling delta waves. We now know that you can have brief and fragmentary dreams in the first three stages of sleep, but eventually you’ll get to the most important stage: full REM sleep, that famous stage of sugarplum slumber that makes eyeballs go nuts, grants vivid visual dreams, and provided the namesake for a certain famous rock band. REM sleep is kinda paradoxical. Your motor cortex is jumping all over the place, but your brainstem is blocking those messages, leaving your muscles so relaxed that you’re basically paralyzed. Except for your eyes. That whole sleep cycle repeats itself every 90 minutes or so, transitioning back and forth between the stages of sleep.

Obviously sleep is super important, and lack of sleep is terrible for your health, mental ability, and mood. In fact it’s a predictor for depression, and has been linked to things like weight gain, as your hunger-arousing and -suppressing hormones get out of whack. Sleep deprivation also causes immune system suppression, and slowed reaction time which is why you should not drive sleepy. Of course, a bad night’s sleep here and there is part of life, but there are a host of bona fide sleep disorders out there that can really make life pretty terrible, or in Mike Birbiglia’s case, land you in the emergency room. We’ve got insomnia, which is persistent problems of falling or staying asleep.

And kind of its opposite, narcolepsy, whose sufferers sometimes experience brief, uncontrollable attacks of overwhelming sleepiness, called “sleep attacks.” This, as you can imagine, can get in the way of all sorts of things that you might enjoy doing, like driving, eating, pole-vaulting. Narcolepsy may have several different causes, including a deficiency in the neurotransmitter hypocretin, which helps keep you awake. But in more rare cases, brain trauma, infection, and disease may contribute to it as well. So, that’s rare, but you probably know someone with sleep apnea, the disorder that causes sleepers to temporarily stop breathing, until their decreased oxygen levels wake them up.

Birbiglia, meanwhile, turned out to have a REM sleep behavior disorder, which we don’t fully understand yet, but appears to be associated with a dopamine deficiency. Then we’ve got night terrors, which are as terrible as they sound... spurring increased heart and breathing rates, screaming, and thrashing that’s seldom remembered upon waking. Night terrors are most common in children under seven, and may be spurred by stress, fatigue, sleep deprivation, and sleeping in unfamiliar surroundings. Much like sleepwalking and sleeptalking, night terrors occur during the NREM-3 stage of sleep, and are NOT the same as nightmares, which occur, like most dreaming, during REM sleep.

But oh, in REM sleep, what dreams may come... There you are, running naked as your teeth fall out, being chased down the beach by a Matt Damon centaur. You wake up, feel around your mouth thinking what? What? What?! WHAT?! Welcome to your dreams, those vivid, emotional images racing through your sleeping brain, often providing a backdrop so bizarre that it may seem like David Lynch, Terry Gilliam, and Tim Burton are trying to out-weird each other in a film festival. A really, really long festival, considering the average person spends about six years of their lives dreaming. So yeah, sometimes you have really crazy dreams. But mostly, your average dream usually just sort of unpacks and reshuffles what you did that day.

For example last night I dreamt about Tumblr, cause I spent a lot of time on Tumblr yesterday. If you played Tetris all afternoon, you might dream of blocks falling from the sky. If something traumatic happened to you, your brain might provide you with a nightmare to help extinguish your daytime fears - Thanks, brain! Then again...you might be unable to stop dreaming about the trauma, which we’ll look at in the future when we discuss post-traumatic stress disorder. Our two-track minds of course allow us to register more stimuli than we outwardly acknowledge during the day, and in that way, the sounds of car alarms or stinky dog farts that you might not even have noticed may get incorporated into your dream, too.

And that’s all interesting and weird and sometimes a little gross, but what’s the real purpose of dreaming? Whyyy do we do this? Well, as you might have guessed, there’s more than one idea out there… The study of dreams is is a mix of neuroscience and psychology known as oneirology. Oneiros is the Greek for dream, and if you’re a Neil Gaiman fan you may recognize it as one of the Sandman’s many names. The one that comes with a toga and Orpheus’s head. But Sandman aside, if you want to talk dreams, we might want to start with our old friend Freud. In his landmark 1900 book The Interpretation of Dreams, Freud proposed that our dreams offer us wish-fulfillment. He thought a dream’s manifest content, the stuff you remember in the morning, was a sort

of censored and symbolic version of whatever inner conflict was really going on in that dream’s unconscious, or latent, content. Not surprisingly, the wish-fulfillment theory lacks scientific chops and has for the most part fallen out of favor -- because, really, you can interpret a dream any way you want. Like, sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. Luckily we have some other theories to consider. The information processing theory proposes that our dreams help us sort out and process the day’s events and fix them into our memories. This may be particularly important when it comes to learning and remembering new information, and some studies show that people recall new tasks better after a good REM sleep full of dreams.

But if brainwave readings show us anything, it’s that there’s a lot going on in your brain when you dream, and the physiological function theory suggests that dreaming may promote neural development and preserve neural pathways by providing the brain with stimulation. When our brains are stimulated, they expand their connections more. So, babies, for example, spend much of their sleep time dreaming, perhaps in part to help their brain circuitry develop more quickly. This is similar to the idea that dreams are part of our cognitive development. By this model, dreams draw on our knowledge and understanding of the world, mimicking reality, and engaging those same brain networks that light up when we daydream.

And finally, there are theories that focus on the way REM sleep triggers neural activity, and the idea that dreams are just sort of accidental side-effects, the brain’s attempt to weave a story out of a bunch of random sights, emotions, and memories -- which is how in dreamland you might actually marry that Matt Damon centaur and give birth to a baby with banana fingers and a raccoon tail. For now scientists continue to debate the function of dreams, but one thing we know for sure is that REM sleep is vital, both biologically and psychologically. But, hey, you think your dreams are nut-bar? Next week, we’re looking at other altered states of consciousness, where you’ll learn what your brain really looks like on drugs, and whether you can actually hypnotize someone

to do your evil bidding… or just act like a chicken. For now, if you’ve stayed awake during this episode, you learned about the four stages of sleep -- NREM 1, 2, 3 and REM itself -- as well as some major theories for the psychological purpose of dreaming, including information processing, physiological function, cognitive development, and neural activity models.

- [06:12] There you are, running naked as your teeth fall out, being chased down the beach by a
- [06:16] Matt Damon centaur.
- [06:17] You wake up, feel around your mouth thinking what?
- [06:20] What?
- [06:21] What?!
- [06:22] WHAT?!
- [06:23] Welcome to your dreams, those vivid, emotional images racing through your sleeping brain,
- [06:27] often providing a backdrop so bizarre that it may seem like David Lynch, Terry Gilliam,
- [06:31] and Tim Burton are trying to out-weird each other in a film festival.
- [06:34] A really, really long festival, considering the average person spends about six years
- [06:39] of their lives dreaming.
- [06:40] So yeah, sometimes you have really crazy dreams.
- [06:43] But mostly, your average dream usually just sort of unpacks and reshuffles what you did
- [06:46] that day.
- [06:47] For example last night I dreamt about Tumblr, cause I spent a lot of time on Tumblr yesterday.
- [06:51] If you played Tetris all afternoon, you might dream of blocks falling from the sky.
- [06:55] If something traumatic happened to you, your brain might provide you with a nightmare to
- [06:58] help extinguish your daytime fears - Thanks, brain!
- [07:01] Then again...you might be unable to stop dreaming about the trauma, which we’ll look at in
- [07:05] the future when we discuss post-traumatic stress disorder.
- [07:07] Our two-track minds of course allow us to register more stimuli than we outwardly acknowledge
- [07:11] during the day, and in that way, the sounds of car alarms or stinky dog farts that you
- [07:15] might not even have noticed may get incorporated into your dream, too.
- [07:18] And that’s all interesting and weird and sometimes a little gross, but what’s the
- [07:22] real purpose of dreaming?
- [07:24] Whyyy do we do this?
- [07:26] Well, as you might have guessed, there’s more than one idea out there…
- [07:29] The study of dreams is is a mix of neuroscience and psychology known as oneirology.
- [07:33] Oneiros is the Greek for dream, and if you’re a Neil Gaiman fan you may recognize it as
- [07:38] one of the Sandman’s many names.
- [07:39] The one that comes with a toga and Orpheus’s head.
- [07:42] But Sandman aside, if you want to talk dreams, we might want to start with our old friend
- [07:45] Freud.
- [07:46] In his landmark 1900 book The Interpretation of Dreams, Freud proposed that our dreams
- [07:50] offer us wish-fulfillment.
- [07:52] He thought a dream’s manifest content, the stuff you remember in the morning, was a sort
- [07:55] of censored and symbolic version of whatever inner conflict was really going on in that
- [08:00] dream’s unconscious, or latent, content.
- [08:02] Not surprisingly, the wish-fulfillment theory lacks scientific chops and has for the most
- [08:06] part fallen out of favor -- because, really, you can interpret a dream any way you want.
- [08:10] Like, sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
- [08:13] Luckily we have some other theories to consider.
- [08:15] The information processing theory proposes that our dreams help us sort out and process
- [08:19] the day’s events and fix them into our memories.
- [08:22] This may be particularly important when it comes to learning and remembering new information,
- [08:26] and some studies show that people recall new tasks better after a good REM sleep full of
- [08:31] dreams.
- [08:32] But if brainwave readings show us anything, it’s that there’s a lot going on in your
- [08:35] brain when you dream, and the physiological function theory suggests that dreaming may
- [08:39] promote neural development and preserve neural pathways by providing the brain with stimulation.
- [08:44] When our brains are stimulated, they expand their connections more.
- [08:47] So, babies, for example, spend much of their sleep time dreaming, perhaps in part to help
- [08:51] their brain circuitry develop more quickly.
- [08:53] This is similar to the idea that dreams are part of our cognitive development.
- [08:57] By this model, dreams draw on our knowledge and understanding of the world, mimicking
- [09:01] reality, and engaging those same brain networks that light up when we daydream.
- [09:05] And finally, there are theories that focus on the way REM sleep triggers neural activity,
- [09:09] and the idea that dreams are just sort of accidental side-effects, the brain’s attempt
- [09:14] to weave a story out of a bunch of random sights, emotions, and memories -- which is
- [09:18] how in dreamland you might actually marry that Matt Damon centaur and give birth to
- [09:22] a baby with banana fingers and a raccoon tail.
- [09:24] For now scientists continue to debate the function of dreams, but one thing we know
- [09:28] for sure is that REM sleep is vital, both biologically and psychologically.
- [09:33] But, hey, you think your dreams are nut-bar?
- [09:35] Next week, we’re looking at other altered states of consciousness, where you’ll learn
- [09:39] what your brain really looks like on drugs, and whether you can actually hypnotize someone
- [09:43] to do your evil bidding… or just act like a chicken.
- [09:46] For now, if you’ve stayed awake during this episode, you learned about the four stages
- [09:50] of sleep -- NREM 1, 2, 3 and REM itself -- as well as some major theories for the psychological
- [09:56] purpose of dreaming, including information processing, physiological function, cognitive
- [10:01] development, and neural activity models.

Lemme get your mind right about hypnosis. First of all, it’s a real thing -- but it’s probably not what you think it is. All kinds of hypnosis-esque practices have been around for centuries, but the Western version of it -- including the kind that you probably associate with people being made to cluck like chickens on stage -- cropped up around the 18th century, that’s when German physician Franz Mesmer started treating all manner of medical problems by putting patients into a trance-like state, during which he claimed to align their “internal magnetic forces,” which he called “animal magnetism.” And many of these mesmerized patients did feel better, but not because of any magnetism or whatever. Mesmer was inadvertently using the healing power of suggestion.

In addition to his magnetic quackery, other physicians didn’t appreciate Mesmer’s kitschy penchant for wearing capes and playing ethereal music on a glass harmonica, and eventually he was discredited. So were his patients just gullible idiots, or was there something else going on? Well, we’ve previously defined consciousness as our awareness of ourselves and our environment, and consciousness is at work pretty much whenever we’re awake, but also while we’re asleep and dreaming. So hypnosis is a good example of an altered state of consciousness -- when you’re fully conscious in the clinical sense, but also not in what you’d consider a normal waking state. As a person who considers himself only the product of one of several states of consciousness,

this one that I am currently in right now, it’s worth pointing out how TREMENDOUSLY WEIRD THIS IS! My brain has these other gears that it occasionally drops into during which, in a sense, I become not me any more. Altered states can also include things like hallucinations, and the effects of psychoactive drugs. But these states aren’t as uncommon as you might think. In fact, you’ve probably experienced an altered state yourself… even if you’ve never taken an illicit drug or been to a cheesy dinner-theater where the main act wore a glittering turban. [INTRO] So, personal opinions of Mesmer aside, here are some facts and fallacies worth knowing about hypnosis. First off, let’s define hypnosis simply as a calm, trance-like state during which

you tend to have heightened concentration and focus, and in which you’re typically more open to suggestion. The phenomenon has been observed in lots of empirically rigorous studies, and it’s been used effectively in treatments for stress and anxiety, weight loss, and chronic pain. BUT! It’s important to understand that even though you’re more open to suggestion when hypnotized, you do NOT lose control over your behavior. So, contrary to what you might see in The Manchurian Candidate or Zoolander, hypnosis can’t make you act totally against your will and, say, jump off a building, rob a donut shop, or commit a murder most foul. Nor is hypnosis a reliable way to enhance the recall of deeply buried memories. We don’t

file away every single one of our experiences. We only permanently store some of them, and even they tend to mutate over time. We’ll be talking all about memory in an upcoming lesson. Finally, only about 20 percent of us are thought to be highly hypnotizable. Those are the folks whom a hypnotist could get to smile at the smell of sour milk just by suggesting it was rosewater. And even though we know hypnosis can increase your suggestibility, there’s still some disagreement about what exactly constitutes a hypnotic state, or how it’s achieved. Remember, just because we observe a phenomenon doesn’t mean that we have a clue about its mechanisms of action, or whether it works the way we think it works.

One popular theory looks at hypnosis as phenomenon of social influence. This camp suggests that, like actors caught up in an intense role, hypnotized subjects may begin to feel and act like “good hypnotic subjects” if they just trust their hypnotist to sort of act like a director and focus their attention. Other researchers suggest that it has more to do with a special dual-processing state of split-consciousness called dissociation. Dissociation is a sort of detachment from your surroundings, which can range from mild spacing out all the way up to a total loss of your sense of yourself. It’s something we all do to some degree or another, and we’re often quite aware that we’re doing it. It’s not hard to think of instances where dissociation might even help us, like when we’re faced

with a dangerous situation that requires quick, reflexive action and not a ton of focus on our own thoughts and feelings. In this way, hypnosis may ease pain, not by magically blocking pain receptors, but by helping us selectively not attend to that pain. Clinicians can do this by basically guiding the patient into a very relaxed, but voluntary state, sort of spaced-out, and then further guiding them through a series of positive thoughts and suggestions. So, in legitimate clinical hypnosis, people aren’t being made to dissociate. Instead, think of them as being asked to dissociate - and some people are better at this than others, which is essentially what being “highly hypnotizable” means. So, clearly there’s a lot going on in our

two-track brains at any given time, and hypnosis -- as researchers understand it -- seems to help us tap into some of that adaptive dissociative capacity that we all seem to have. But say you’re not so into the idea of someone feeding you suggestions. Probably the most classic way to voluntarily enter an altered state of consciousness is by using drugs. Most of us have used some kind of legal drug… your morning coffee, a beer at lunch, some Tylenol PM to put you the bed… and lots and lots of folks responsibly use prescription and nonprescription drugs. But of course, some people develop problems. The more you use a substance, legal or illegal, the less you feel its effects as your tolerance grows. And soon enough, a two-beer buzz turns

into a four-beer buzz or a case-of-beer buzz. That’s your brain chemistry adapting to offset the drug effect in a process called neuroadaptation. Keep on that road and soon you’ll risk a physical and/or psychological addiction to the substance you choose, or the substance that chose you. And that’s not even to mention serious physiological and neurological damage, as happens with severe and long-term alcohol abuse. We’ll be delving more deeply into the science of addiction in an upcoming episode, but for now, let’s take a look at some of these drug families and how they jack you up, knock you out, make you do dumb things, see imaginary stuff, and generally alter your consciousness. Psychoactive drugs are chemical substances

that alter your mood and perception. They’re the ones that go right to your brain’s synapses, mimicking the functions of neurotransmitters. They also work by tapping into the psychological component - in other words, the user’s expectations about what substance use might mean. Like if you really believe that drinking tequila makes you more aggressive, and I give you a virgin margarita, your mere expectation of getting all surly and aggro may actually lead you to punch someone in the neck. That’s also called the placebo effect. Whether smoked, snorted, ingested, or injected, we’ll put all of them into three general categories: depressants, stimulants, and hallucinogens. Depressants, like alcohol, tranquilizers,

and opiates, do exactly what you’d expect--they bring the mellow, slow body functions, and suppress neural activity. Historically, the world’s favorite depressant is alcohol. Beat writer William S. Burroughs even called it “our national drug.” A little bit of hooch may get the party started, but not because it’s stimulating anyone. Rather, it’s acting as a disinhibitor, impairing your brain’s judgement areas, while reducing your self-awareness and self-control. And then because alcohol disrupts memory formations you may wake up wondering where one of your eyebrows went. Similar to booze, tranquilizers, or barbiturates, depress nervous system activity and may be prescribed to ease anxiety or insomnia, though

high doses can negatively affect memory and judgement. And really high doses, or bad interactions with other substances like alcohol, can kill you. Opiates, like poppy-flower superstar opium and its derivatives morphine and heroin, work in a similar way, depressing neural activity and enveloping the brain in a fog of no-pain bliss. The thing is, if a brain keeps getting flooded with outside opiates, it will eventually stop brewing its own natural pain killing neurotransmitters, endorphins. The resulting withdrawal is particularly nasty. Stimulants, obviously, excite rather than suppress neural activity, and speed up body functions, bringing up your energy, self-confidence, and changing your mood. On the legal end of the spectrum here, we’ve got caffeine, nicotine,

and prescription amphetamines, building up to the more serious illegal stuff like street amphetamines, meth, Ecstasy, and cocaine. And you know who loved his coke? Freud. He loved i—t so much—it cheered him up when we was feeling down, opened up his mind, and turned him into chatty Kathy. He even wrote his first big publication, “Über Coca” in 1884 about it. During his famous coke years in his late 20s and 30s, he believed that the drug was a viable cure for morphine addiction. Which… not so much. Luckily he gave his nose a rest and finally dropped the habit by his 40s to focus full-time on his cigar addiction. Which is the thing that ultimately killed him. Cocaine hits the bloodstream in a flash of energetic euphoria that quickly taxes the

brain’s supply of dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. Methamphetamine also triggers the release of dopamine. You’ll remember from our lesson on neurotransmitters how these chemical messengers affect our moods, emotions, attention, and alertness. So when those neurotransmitters are excessively activated, they can become temporarily depleted, which is what causes that agitated, depressive crash that users often feel. If you drink coffee every morning, and then you skip a day, you’ll likely be tired and cranky with a pounding headache. Now multiply that awful feeling by like thousands and you’ll see why people with coke and meth addictions might keep chasing that high while their bodies and lives fall apart around them. In addition to depressants and stimulants,

we’ve got hallucinogens, which come in a variety of plant and fungal forms, as well as synthetic forms like LSD or lysergic acid diethylamide. Also called psychedelics, these drugs distort perceptions and evoke sensory images in the absence of actual sensory input. Which means you could end up seeing, hearing, smelling, or feeling things that are not real. This could be quite nice, if you’re like, petting baby dolphins or something, but it could also be panic-inducing and generally messed up, if you think you’ve got a bunch of centipedes crawling under your skin. The thing is, there are lots of ways to involuntarily hallucinate without the use of drugs. Seizures, brain injuries, diseases, sensory deprivation,

fever, stress, or even extreme grief or depression can all cause neurological disturbances that spur hallucinations of one kind or another. Many healthy people have reported experiencing vivid auditory hallucinations when in emergencies, like, you broke your knee skiing and you wanted to just fall asleep forever in that blanket of soft snow, but a strong, seemingly audible voice ordered you to KEEP MOVING. And bizarrely, it isn’t uncommon for people who lose the use of one sense—like vision or smell--to perceive sights and odors they are no longer capable of sensing as their brains pull from old memories to produce hallucinations as a way to compensate for that loss. All this just goes to show that whether you’re

a psychologist, neuroscientist, or philosopher, our various states of consciousness provide a rich, complex world of inquiry to contemplate, showing yet again, just what a messy and marvelous thing the human mind is. If your consciousness wasn’t too altered today, you learned what hypnosis is and what it can and can’t do; how psychoactive depressant, stimulant, and hallucinogenic drugs work on the brain; and how non-drug induced hallucinations can happen to anyone.

- [08:21] on his cigar addiction. Which is the thing that ultimately killed him.
- [08:24] Cocaine hits the bloodstream in a flash of energetic euphoria that quickly taxes the
- [08:29] brain’s supply of dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. Methamphetamine also triggers
- [08:33] the release of dopamine. You’ll remember from our lesson on neurotransmitters how these
- [08:37] chemical messengers affect our moods, emotions, attention, and alertness. So when those neurotransmitters
- [08:42] are excessively activated, they can become temporarily depleted, which is what causes
- [08:46] that agitated, depressive crash that users often feel.
- [08:49] If you drink coffee every morning, and then you skip a day, you’ll likely be tired and
- [08:53] cranky with a pounding headache. Now multiply that awful feeling by like thousands and you’ll
- [08:58] see why people with coke and meth addictions might keep chasing that high while their bodies
- [09:03] and lives fall apart around them. In addition to depressants and stimulants,
- [09:06] we’ve got hallucinogens, which come in a variety of plant and fungal forms, as well
- [09:10] as synthetic forms like LSD or lysergic acid diethylamide. Also called psychedelics, these
- [09:16] drugs distort perceptions and evoke sensory images in the absence of actual sensory input.
- [09:21] Which means you could end up seeing, hearing, smelling, or feeling things that are not real.
- [09:25] This could be quite nice, if you’re like, petting baby dolphins or something, but it
- [09:29] could also be panic-inducing and generally messed up, if you think you’ve got a bunch
- [09:32] of centipedes crawling under your skin. The thing is, there are lots of ways to involuntarily
- [09:36] hallucinate without the use of drugs. Seizures, brain injuries, diseases, sensory deprivation,
- [09:41] fever, stress, or even extreme grief or depression can all cause neurological disturbances that
- [09:46] spur hallucinations of one kind or another. Many healthy people have reported experiencing
- [09:51] vivid auditory hallucinations when in emergencies, like, you broke your knee skiing and you wanted
- [09:56] to just fall asleep forever in that blanket of soft snow, but a strong, seemingly audible
- [10:01] voice ordered you to KEEP MOVING. And bizarrely, it isn’t uncommon for people
- [10:06] who lose the use of one sense—like vision or smell--to perceive sights and odors they
- [10:10] are no longer capable of sensing as their brains pull from old memories to produce hallucinations
- [10:16] as a way to compensate for that loss. All this just goes to show that whether you’re
- [10:21] a psychologist, neuroscientist, or philosopher, our various states of consciousness provide
- [10:24] a rich, complex world of inquiry to contemplate, showing yet again, just what a messy and marvelous
- [10:31] thing the human mind is. If your consciousness wasn’t too altered
- [10:34] today, you learned what hypnosis is and what it can and can’t do; how psychoactive depressant,
- [10:39] stimulant, and hallucinogenic drugs work on the brain; and how non-drug induced hallucinations
- [10:44] can happen to anyone.
