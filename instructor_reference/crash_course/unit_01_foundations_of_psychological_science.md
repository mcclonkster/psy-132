That dream about the dinosaur in the leotard, those times that you said that thing that you know you shouldn't have said, or even that thing you didn't even know you were gonna say. The little cogs of your consciousness cranking away, making your life possible, making society function, all of the things that you're so glad you can do and all of the ones that you wish you could stop doing. Excluding other human minds, your mind is the most complicated piece of the universe that humans currently know about. The rules that govern it are mysterious and elusive. Maybe our brains just aren't complex enough to understand themselves. But that's not going to stop us from trying! The word 'psychology' comes from the Latin for the "study of the soul." And while its

formal definition has evolved over the last several decades, today we can safely call it the science of behavior and mental processes. The term 'psychology' wasn't coined until around the turn of the sixteenth century, and the practice that we would actually call science today wasn't established until the mid-1800s. But of course, humans have always been curious about themselves and what's going on up here. Aristotle pondered the seed of human consciousness and decided that it was in the heart, not the head -- being, as we have seen quite a lot here on Crash Course, absolutely and completely wrong. Two thousand years ago, Chinese rulers conducted the world's first psychological exams, requiring

public officials to take personality and intelligence tests. And in the late 800s, Persian doctor Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Rhazes, also known as Rhazes, was one of the first to describe mental illness, and even treated patients in what was essentially a very early psych ward in his Baghdad hospital. From the efforts of those early thinkers up until today, the field of psychology has been all about tackling some of the big questions: How can humans do horrible things like commit genocide and torture other humans, and how come we know those things are horrible? Do we have free will, or are we simply driven by our environment, biology, and non-conscious influences? What is mental illness, and what can we do about it? And what is consciousness?

Or the notion of self? If I lose my awareness of myself, am I still human? I DON'T KNOW! But over the next 6 months, these are the questions that we're gonna be exploring together: how our brains work, how they can break, how they can be healed, why we behave the way we do, even when we don't want to, and what it means to be thinking and feeling and alive. [Intro] When hearing the word psychology, most people probably think of a therapist listening to a patient unpacking the details of his day while reclining on a couch. Maybe that therapist is wearing glasses, chewing on a cigar, stroking his whiskered chin. Admit it! If you're thinking about psychology, you're probably picturing Freud.

Sigmund Freud was one of the most tremendously influential and controversial thinkers of his time, maybe of all time. His theories helped build our views on childhood, personality, dreams and sexuality. And his work fueled a legacy of both support and opposition. His life was long and spanned an important swath of history from the American Civil War to World War II. But like most great scientists, Freud developed his revolutionary ideas by building on the work of others, and of course innovation in the field didn't stop with him. In truth, psychology is one of the most wildly diverse sciences in terms of the questions it proposes, the methods it applies, and the different schools of thought and disciplines it contains.

Perhaps more than any other science, psychology is just a big old integrated melting pot. For instance, right around Freud's time, there were a lot of different schools of thought of about how the study of the human mind should be tackled. Mainly, there were the ideas of structuralism, functionalism and psychoanalysis. Scientific psychology got its start in 1879 in Germany when physician Wilhelm Wundt set up the first psychology laboratory at the University of Leipzig just a few years after publishing his Principles of Physiological Psychology, considered the first true psychology textbook. Wundt and his student Edward Bradford Titchener took cues from chemists and physicists and argued that if those people could break down all matter into simple elements or structures,

why couldn't they do the same for the brain? They tried to understand the structures of consciousness by getting patients to look inward, asking them how they felt when they watched the sun set, or smelled a coffee, or licked a kitten, or whatever. Titchener named this approach 'structuralism', but despite its rigid sounding name, it really relied so much on introspection that it became too subjective. I mean, you may sense and feel something different that I do, even if we lick the same kitten. Psychologists, of course, can't actually observe a patient's inner thoughts or feelings, so ultimately, the structuralist school of thought was fairly short-lived. By contrast, American physician and philosopher William James proposed a different set of

questions, focusing on why we think and feel and smell and lick, or whatever. Basically, he focused on the function of behavior. This approach, 'functionalism', was based on Charles Darwin's idea that adaptive behaviors are conserved throughout the evolutionary process. James published his seminal book, The Principles of Psychology, in 1890, defining psychology as the science of mental life, just as Freud was starting to flex his big brain. Sigmund Freud began his medical career at a Viennese hospital, but in 1886, he started his own practice, specializing in nervous disorders. During this time, Freud witnessed his colleague Josef Breuer treat a patient called Anna O with a new talking cure. Basically,

he just let her talk about her symptoms. The more she talked and pulled up traumatic memories, the more her symptoms were reduced. It was a breakthrough, and it changed Freud forever. From then on, Freud encouraged his patients to talk freely about whatever came to mind, to free associate. This technique provided the basis for his career, and an entire branch of psychology. In 1900 he published his book The Interpretation of Dreams, where he introduced his theory of psychoanalysis. Now, you probably think of psychoanalysis as a treatment -- the whole patient on the couch scenario. And that's definitely part of it. But Freud's concept was actually a lot more complex than that, and it was revolutionary.

A radical kernel of psychoanalysis was the theory that our personalities are shaped by unconscious motives. Basically Freud suggested that we're all profoundly affected by mental processes that we're not even aware of. Now that sounds almost obvious to us now, but part of the genius of Freud's theory was that in 1900, it wasn't obvious at all. The idea that our minds could be driven by something that our minds themselves didn't know about was hard to grasp. As hard as like, uhh, maybe organisms evolving by natural selection. It was abstract, invisible, and there was something about it that seemed irrational. But the other important part of Freud's theory was that the unconscious, literally the thing

below consciousness, was still discoverable. Even though you weren't aware of it, you could come to understand it through a therapeutic technique that used dreams, projections and free association to root out repressed feelings and and gain self-insight. So what Freud was really saying was that mental disorders could be healed through talk therapy and self-discovery. And this was a really big breakthrough. Because prior to this, people with mental illnesses would be confined to sanatoriums and at best given menial labor to do and at worst, shackled to a bed frame. After The Interpretations of Dreams, Freud went on to publish over 20 more books and countless papers with an iconic cigar in hand all the while. He believed smoking helped

him think, but it also helped him get jaw cancer. During the last sixteen years of his life, he underwent at least thirty painful operations while continuing to smoke. By the late 1930s, the Nazis had taken over Austria, and Freud and his Jewish family narrowly escaped to England. By September 1939, the pain in his cancerous jaw was too great and a doctor friend assisted him in suicide through morphine injection. He was eighty-three. Whether you love him or hate him - and make no mistake, plenty of people vehemently disagreed with him - there is no question that Freud's impact on psychology was monumental. While competing theories in the young field of psychology either fell away or evolved into something else, psychoanalysis remains an important concept and practice today.

The next big shake-up rolled in during the first half of the 20th century when behaviorism gained a higher profile. Heavy hitters like Ivan Pavlov, John B. Watson, and B. F. Skinner were key players here. They focused on the study of observable behavior. You may remember Skinner as the dude who put rats and pigeons and babies in boxes and conditioned them to perform certain behaviors. Right around when Freud escaped to England, Skinner published his Behavior of Organisms, ushering in the era of behaviorism which remained all the rage well into the 1960s. The other major force at the time was, of course, Freud's psychoanalysis, and its many descendents collectively known as the psychodynamic theories. These focused on the importance

of early experiences in shaping the unconsciousness and how that process affects our thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and personalities. By the mid-20th century, other major forces in psychology were also brewing -- schools we'll explore later in this course including humanist psychology, which focuses on nurturing personal growth; cognitive science and neuroscience, all of which contributed their own unique takes on the study of mind. Today's formal definition of psychology, the study of behavior and mental processes, is a nice amalgamation that pulls from all these different schools of thought. It recognizes the need for observing and recording behavior, whether that's screaming, crying or playing air saxophone to an imaginary audience, but it also gives credit to our mental processes:

what we think and feel and believe while we're tearing it up on our invisible instruments. Because again, the point I really want you to take home is that psychology is an integrative science. Yes, folks still get grumpy and disagree plenty, but the essence of the discipline has everything to do with creating different ways of asking interesting questions and attempting to answer them through all kinds of data-gathering methods. The human mind is complicated. There is no single way to effectively crack it open; it must be pried at from all sides. Harvard astronomer Owen Gingerich has gazed into the distant horizon of space, and even he has acknowledged that the human brain is by far the most complex physical object known

to us in the entire cosmos. And we all get to have one! Of our very own! Just knocking around right up in here. We here at Crash Course are really excited to spend the next several months delving into the world of psychology -- how it applies to our lives, our minds, and our hearts, and how it deepens our understanding of each other, our world, and ourselves. Thanks for watching this first lesson in Crash Course Psychology, and I'd like to especially thank all of our Subbable subscribers, without whom we would literally not be able to do this.

### Transcript (reading)

Can week-old pizza cause psychedelic hallucinations? Does coffee make you smarter? Or does it just make you do dumb stuff faster? Like a bunch of psychology itself, questions like this can seem pretty intuitive. I mean, people may not be the easiest organisms to understand, but you're a person, right? So you must be qualified to draw, like, some conclusions about other people and what makes them tick. But it's important to realize that your intuition isn't always right. In fact, sometimes it is exactly wrong, and we tend to grossly underestimate the dangers of false intuition. If you have an idea about a person and their behavior that turns out to be right, that reinforces your trust in your intuition.

Like if one of my buddies, Bob, begins eating that deep-dish pizza that's been in the fridge for the past week but he eats it anyway and soon starts to wig out, I'll say "Dude, I told you so". But if I'm wrong and he's totally fine, I probably won't even think about it ever again. This is known as 'Hindsight Bias" or the "I-Knew-It-All-Along" phenomenon. This doesn't mean the common sense is wrong, it just means that our intuitive sense more easily describes what just happened, than what will happen in the future. Another reason you can't blindly trust your intuition is your natural tendency toward overconfidence. Sometimes, you just really, really feel like you're right about people when actually you're really, really wrong.

We've all been there. We also tend to perceive order in random events, which can lead to false assumptions. For example, if you flip a coin five times you have equal chances of getting all tails as you do getting alternating heads and tails. But we see the series of five tails as something unusual, as a streak, and thus giving that result some kind of meaning that it very definitely does not have. That is why we have the methods and safe-guards of psychological research and experimentation, and the glorious process of scientific inquiry. They help us to get around these problems and basically save the study of our minds from the stupidity of our minds. So I hope that it won't be a spoiler if I tell you now that pizza won't make you trip, and coffee doesn't make you smart.

Sorry. [Intro] In most ways psychological research is no different than any other scientific discipline, like step one is always figuring out how to ask general questions about your subject and turn them into measurable, testable propositions. This is called operationalizing your questions. So you know how the scientific method works -- it starts with a question and a theory, and I don't mean theory in the sense of like, a hunch that say, a quad-shot of espresso makes you think better. Instead, in science a theory is what explains and organizes lots of different observations and predicts outcomes. And when you come up with a testable prediction, that's your hypothesis. Once your theory and hypothesis are in place, you need a clear and common language to report

them with, so for example, defining exactly what you mean by "thinking better" with your espresso hypothesis will allow other researchers to replicate the experiment. And replication is key. You can watch a person exhibit a certain behavior once, and it won't prove very much, but if you keep getting consistent results, even as you change subjects or situations, you're probably on to something. This is a problem with one popular type of psychological research: case studies, which take an in-depth look at one individual. Case studies can sometimes be misleading, because by their nature, they can't be replicated, so they run the risk of over-generalizing. Still, they're good at showing us what CAN happen, and end up framing questions for more extensive and generalizable studies.

They're also often memorable and a great story telling device psychologists use to observe and describe behavior. Like, say the smell of coffee makes Carl suddenly anxious and irritable -- that obviously doesn't mean that it has that same effect on everyone. In fact, Carl has terrible memories associated with that smell, and so his case is actually quite rare. Poor Carl. But you would still have to look at lots of other cases to determine that conclusively. Another popular method of psychological research is naturalistic observation, where researchers simply watch behavior in a natural environment, whether that's chimps poking ant-hills in the jungle, kids clowning in a classroom or drunk dudes yelling at soccer games.

The idea is to let the subjects just do their thing without trying to manipulate or control the situation. So yeah, basically just spying on people. Like case studies, naturalistic observations are great at describing behavior, but they're very limited in explaining it. Psychologists can also collect behavioral data using surveys or interviews, asking people to report their opinions and behaviors. Sexuality researcher Alfred Kinsey famously used this technique when he surveyed thousands of men and women on their sexual history and published his findings in a pair of revolutionary texts, Sexual Behavior in the Human Male and Female respectively. Surveys are a great way to access consciously held attitudes and beliefs, but how to ask

the questions can be tricky; subtle word choices can influence results. For example more forceful words like "ban" or "censor" may elicit different reactions than "limit" or "not allow". Asking "Do you believe in space aliens?" is a much different question than "Do you think that there is intelligent life somewhere else in the universe?" It's the same question, but in the first the subject might assume you mean aliens visiting earth, and making crop circles and abducting people and poking them. And if how you phrase surveys is important, so is who you ask. I could ask a room full of students at a pacifist club meeting what they think about arms control, but the result wouldn't be a representative measure of where students stand, because there's a pretty clear sampling bias at work here.

To fairly represent a population, I'd need to get a random sample where all members of the target group, in this case students, had an equal chance of being selected to answer the question. So once you've described behavior with surveys, case studies, or naturalistic observation, you can start making sense out of it, and even predict future behavior. One way to do that is to look at one trait or behavior is related to another, or how they correlate. So let's get back to my buddy Bob who seems to think that his refrigerator is actually some kind of time machine that can preserve food indefinitely. Let's say that Bob has just tucked into a lunch of questionable leftovers, pizza that may very well have had a little bit of fungus on it.

But he was hungry, and lazy, and so he doused it in Sriracha. Suddenly, he starts seeing things: green armadillos with laser beam eyes. From here we could deduce that eating unknown fungus predicts hallucination, that's a correlation. But correlation is not causation. Yes, it makes sense that eating questionable fungus would cause hallucinations, but it's possible that Bob was already on the verge of a psychotic episode, and those fuzzy leftovers were actually benign. Or there could be an entirely different factor involved, like maybe he hadn't slept in 72 hours, or had an intense migraine coming on, and one of those factors caused his hallucinations. It's tempting to draw conclusions from correlations, but it's super-important to remember that

correlations predict the possibility of cause-and-effect relationships; they cannot prove them. So we've talked about how to describe behavior without manipulating it and how to make connections and predictions from those findings. But that can only take you so far; to really get to the bottom of cause-and-effect behaviors, you're gonna have to start experimenting. Experiments allow investigators to isolate different effects by manipulating an independent variable, and keeping all other variables constant, or as constant as you can. This means that they need at least two groups: the experimental group, which is gonna get messed with, and the control group, which is not gonna get messed with.

Just as surveys use random samples, experimental researchers need to randomly assign participants to each group to minimize potential confounding variables, or outside factors that may skew the results. You don't want all grumpy teenagers in one group and all wealthy Japanese surfers in the other; they gotta mingle. Now sometimes one or both groups are not informed about what's actually being tested. For example, researchers can test how substances effect people by comparing their effects to placebos, or inert substances. And often, the researchers themselves don't know which group is experimental and which is control, so they don't unintentionally influence the results through their own behavior, in which case it's called, you guessed it, a double blind procedure.

So let's put these ideas into practice in our own little experiment. Like all good work, it starts with a question. So the other day my friend Bernice and I were debating. We were debating caffeine's effect on the brain. Personally, she convinced that coffee helps her focus and think better, but I get all jittery like a caged meerkat and can't focus on anything. And because we know that overconfidence can lead you to believe things that are not true, we decided to use some critical thinking. So let's figure out our question: "Do humans solve problems faster when given caffeine?" Now we gotta boil that down into a testable prediction. Remember: keep it clear, simple, and eloquent so that it can be replicated.

"Caffeine makes me smarter" is not a great hypothesis. A better one would be, say, "Adult humans given caffeine will navigate a maze faster than humans not given caffeine." The caffeine dosage is your independent variable, the thing that you can change. So, you'll need some coffee. Your result or dependent variable, the thing that depends on the thing that you can change is going to be the speed at which the subject navigates through this giant corn maze. Go out on the street, wrangle up a bunch of different kinds of people and randomly assign them into three different groups. Also at this point, the American Psychological Association suggests that you acquire everyone's informed consent to participate.

You don't want to force anyone to be in your experiment, no matter how cool you think it is. So the control group gets a placebo, in this case decaf. Experimental group one gets a low dose of caffeine, which we'll define at a 100 milligrams; just an eye opener, like, a cup of coffee's worth. Experimental group two gets 500 milligrams, more than a quad shot of espresso dunked in a Red Bull. Once you dose everyone, turn them lose in the maze and wait at the other end with a stopwatch. All that's left is to measure your results from the three different groups and compare them to see if there were any conclusive results. If the highly dosed folks got through it twice as fast as the low dose and the placebo groups,

then Bernice's hypothesis was correct, and she can rub my face in it saying she was right all along, but really that would just be the warm flush of hindsight bias telling her something she didn't really know until we tested it. Then, because we've used clear language and defined our parameters, other curious minds can easily replicate this experiment, and we can eventually pool all the data together and have something solid to say about what that macchiato was doing to your cognition– or at least the speed at which you can run through a maze.

### Transcript (navigation)

- [00:00] Can week-old pizza cause psychedelic hallucinations?
- [00:02] Does coffee make you smarter?
- [00:04] Or does it just make you do dumb stuff faster?
- [00:06] Like a bunch of psychology itself, questions like this can seem pretty intuitive.
- [00:09] I mean, people may not be the easiest organisms to understand, but you're a person, right?
- [00:13] So you must be qualified to draw, like, some conclusions about other people and what makes
- [00:18] them tick.
- [00:19] But it's important to realize that your intuition isn't always right.
- [00:22] In fact, sometimes it is exactly wrong, and we tend to grossly underestimate the dangers
- [00:27] of false intuition.
- [00:28] If you have an idea about a person and their behavior that turns out to be right, that
- [00:32] reinforces your trust in your intuition.
- [00:34] Like if one of my buddies, Bob, begins eating that deep-dish pizza that's been in the fridge
- [00:38] for the past week but he eats it anyway and soon starts to wig out, I'll say "Dude, I
- [00:42] told you so".
- [00:43] But if I'm wrong and he's totally fine, I probably won't even think about it ever again.
- [00:49] This is known as 'Hindsight Bias" or the "I-Knew-It-All-Along" phenomenon.
- [00:52] This doesn't mean the common sense is wrong, it just means that our intuitive sense more
- [00:56] easily describes what just happened, than what will happen in the future.
- [01:00] Another reason you can't blindly trust your intuition is your natural tendency toward
- [01:04] overconfidence.
- [01:05] Sometimes, you just really, really feel like you're right about people when actually you're
- [01:11] really, really wrong.
- [01:12] We've all been there.
- [01:13] We also tend to perceive order in random events, which can lead to false assumptions.
- [01:18] For example, if you flip a coin five times you have equal chances of getting all tails
- [01:22] as you do getting alternating heads and tails.
- [01:25] But we see the series of five tails as something unusual, as a streak, and thus giving that
- [01:30] result some kind of meaning that it very definitely does not have.
- [01:33] That is why we have the methods and safe-guards of psychological research and experimentation,
- [01:39] and the glorious process of scientific inquiry.
- [01:42] They help us to get around these problems and basically save the study of our minds
- [01:46] from the stupidity of our minds.
- [01:48] So I hope that it won't be a spoiler if I tell you now that pizza won't make you trip,
- [01:53] and coffee doesn't make you smart.
- [01:59] Sorry.
- [02:01] [Intro]
- [02:04] In most ways psychological research is no different than any other scientific discipline,
- [02:10] like step one is always figuring out how to ask general questions about your subject and
- [02:15] turn them into measurable, testable propositions.
- [02:18] This is called operationalizing your questions.
- [02:21] So you know how the scientific method works -- it starts with a question and a theory,
- [02:25] and I don't mean theory in the sense of like, a hunch that say, a quad-shot of espresso
- [02:29] makes you think better.
- [02:31] Instead, in science a theory is what explains and organizes lots of different observations
- [02:36] and predicts outcomes.
- [02:37] And when you come up with a testable prediction, that's your hypothesis.
- [02:41] Once your theory and hypothesis are in place, you need a clear and common language to report
- [02:45] them with, so for example, defining exactly what you mean by "thinking better" with your
- [02:49] espresso hypothesis will allow other researchers to replicate the experiment.
- [02:53] And replication is key.
- [02:55] You can watch a person exhibit a certain behavior once, and it won't prove very much, but if
- [03:00] you keep getting consistent results, even as you change subjects or situations, you're
- [03:04] probably on to something.
- [03:05] This is a problem with one popular type of psychological research: case studies, which
- [03:10] take an in-depth look at one individual.
- [03:13] Case studies can sometimes be misleading, because by their nature, they can't be replicated,
- [03:17] so they run the risk of over-generalizing.
- [03:18] Still, they're good at showing us what CAN happen, and end up framing questions for more
- [03:23] extensive and generalizable studies.
- [03:25] They're also often memorable and a great story telling device psychologists use to observe
- [03:29] and describe behavior.
- [03:30] Like, say the smell of coffee makes Carl suddenly anxious and irritable -- that obviously doesn't
- [03:36] mean that it has that same effect on everyone.
- [03:37] In fact, Carl has terrible memories associated with that smell, and so his case is actually
- [03:42] quite rare.
- [03:44] Poor Carl.
- [03:45] But you would still have to look at lots of other cases to determine that conclusively.
- [03:48] Another popular method of psychological research is naturalistic observation, where researchers
- [03:53] simply watch behavior in a natural environment, whether that's chimps poking ant-hills in
- [03:57] the jungle, kids clowning in a classroom or drunk dudes yelling at soccer games.
- [04:01] The idea is to let the subjects just do their thing without trying to manipulate or control
- [04:06] the situation.
- [04:07] So yeah, basically just spying on people.
- [04:09] Like case studies, naturalistic observations are great at describing behavior, but they're
- [04:13] very limited in explaining it.
- [04:15] Psychologists can also collect behavioral data using surveys or interviews, asking people
- [04:19] to report their opinions and behaviors.
- [04:22] Sexuality researcher Alfred Kinsey famously used this technique when he surveyed thousands
- [04:26] of men and women on their sexual history and published his findings in a pair of revolutionary
- [04:31] texts, Sexual Behavior in the Human Male and Female respectively.

- [04:40] the questions can be tricky; subtle word choices can influence results.
- [04:44] For example more forceful words like "ban" or "censor" may elicit different reactions
- [04:48] than "limit" or "not allow".
- [04:50] Asking "Do you believe in space aliens?" is a much different question than "Do you think
- [04:54] that there is intelligent life somewhere else in the universe?"
- [04:56] It's the same question, but in the first the subject might assume you mean aliens visiting
- [05:00] earth, and making crop circles and abducting people and poking them.
- [05:04] And if how you phrase surveys is important, so is who you ask.
