Question: Why do people do horrible things? Slave owners, and Nazis, any of the perpetrators of history's atrocities. How do they so successfully dehumanize other people for so long? At a smaller scale, how do bullies in the lunchroom manage to treat other kids with such cruelty and then go home and pet their dog and call their grandma and say "happy birthday?" Most of what we've been studying so far has focused on the individual. We've covered sub-fields of psychology like cognitive, personality, and clinical psychology, which tend to address the phenomena contained within a single person's mind. But there's also social psychology, which focuses on the power of the situation. It examines how we think about, influence,

and relate to one another in certain conditions. And it's better equipped to answer this question about people doing horrible things. Social psychology can not only give us some of the tools we need to understand why people behave brutally, it can also help us understand why we sometimes act heroically. Like why did Jean Valjean reveal his true identity to save some stranger from being tried in his place? And why did Nazi Oskar Schindler risk his own hide to save over a thousand Jewish people? What made Darth Vader throw the Emperor down that hole, even as he was being electrocuted? I can't say there are any easy answers about humanity's greatness or it's horribleness. Certainly, there aren't any that we can find in the next ten minutes. But we can point

ourselves in the right direction, and it starts with social thinking. When we're trying to understand why people act like villains or heroes, one of the things we're really asking is, "Did they do what they did because of their personality? Or their situation?" Austrian psychologist Fritz Heider began plumbing the depths of this question in the 1920s when he was developing what's now known as the Attribution Theory. This theory simply suggests that we can explain someone's behavior by crediting either their stable, enduring traits - also known as their disposition - or the situation at hand. And we tend to attribute people's behavior to either one or the other. Sounds pretty simple, but it can be surprisingly hard to tell whether someone's behavior is dispositional or situational.

Say you see Bruno at a party and he's acting like a wallflower all night. You might assume that he just has a shy personality. But maybe he doesn't; maybe he'd ordinarily be re-enacting all the moves from Footloose at this party but on this night, he had a twisted ankle or a headache or he'd just seen his ex with somebody new - those are all situational explanations. Overestimating the forces of personality while underestimating the power of the situation is called the Fundamental Attribution Error. And as you can imagine, making this kind of error can really end up warping your opinion of another person and lead to false snap judgments. This might not be such a big deal when it comes to Bruno and his awesome dance moves

but according to one study of college students, 7 in 10 women report that men have misread their polite friendliness - which would be appropriate for the situation - as a sexual come-on. We choose how we explain other people's behavior everyday and what we choose to believe can have big consequences. For example, our political views will likely be strongly influenced by whether we decide to attribute poverty or homelessness to personal dispositions, like being lazy and looking for a hand-out, or social circumstances like lack of education and opportunity. And these attitudes can, in turn, affect our actions. Activists and politicians know this well and they can use it to their advantage to persuade people in different ways.

In the late 1970s and 80s, psychologist Richard Petty and John Cacioppo developed a dual process theory of understanding how persuasion works. The first part of their model is known as the Central Route Persuasion and it involves calling on basic thinking and reasoning to convince people. This is what's at work when interested people focus on the evidence and arguments at hand, and are persuaded by the actual content of the message. So when you're watching a political debate, you might be persuaded by a candidate's particular policies, positions or voting history. That is, the stuff they're actually sayin'. But we all know that persuasion involves more than that. There is also Peripheral Route Persuasion at work. This influences people by the way of incidental cues, like a speaker's

physical attractiveness or personal relatability. There's not a lot of hard thinking going on here, it's more of a gut reaction. So you might decide to vote for a particular candidate because you think they're cute or they're from your home town. Peripheral Route Persuasion happens more readily when you're not paying a ton of attention, which is why billboards and television ads can be scarily effective. So that's how politicians and advertisers and maybe bosses and teachers and pushy friends try to change our behavior by changing our attitudes. But, it turns out that the reverse is true too. Our attitudes can be affected by our behaviors. You might have heard about the phrase, "Fake it till you make it." Meaning,

if you smile when you're actually sad the act of smiling may carry you through an attitude change until you actually feel better. Sometimes we can manipulate ourselves this way, but it's also an incredibly effective method people use to persuade each other. It generally works best in increments, through what psychologists call the foot-in-the-door phenomenon. People tend to more readily comply with a big request after they've first agreed to smaller more innocuous requests. Like Darth Vader didn't just go from "Go get 'em Anakin," to Dark Lord overnight. He was slowly enticed to the dark side, by a series of escalating actions and attitude changes. Do this favor for me, now run this errand, now kill these Padawans. Now blow up a planet!

What started this small actions went on to become big ones, suddenly transforming Vader's belief's about himself and others. There's plenty of experimental evidence that moral action really does strengthens moral convictions, just as amoral action strengthen amoral attitudes. And there is perhaps no better example of this than the Stanford Prison Experiment. Back in 1971 Stanford psych professor Philip Zimbardo and his team put an ad in the local paper looking for volunteers to participate in a 14 day experiment. After screening around 70 applicants, 24 male college students were deemed physically and mentally fit enough to participate in the study. For their troubles they'd each be given $15 a day.

The participants didn't know the exact nature of the experiment, just that it involved a fake prison situation. And with a coin flip, half were randomly deemed prisoners and the other half guards. The guards were told that it was the prisoner's behavior that was being studied. The prisoners weren't told much of anything, aside from that they had been arrested and taken to prison. Other than that neither group had many specific instructions. Zimbardo wanted to observe how each party adapted to their roles, and so, on a quiet Sunday summer morning in Palo Alto, real cops swooped in and arrested the prisoners in their homes under charges of robbery. They were frisked, handcuffed, and read their rights.

Back at the station, they were formally booked and then blindfolded in a holding cell wearing only hospital gowns. The researchers had taken great care to make sure that the setting was extremely realistic, which is one reason they used real cops in the arrest before handing the prisoners over to the fake guards. And it took no time at all for this role-playing to become really, really real. The initial trauma of the humiliation of the arrest, the booking, strip-searching and waiting, immediately kicked off a loss of identity in the prisoners. A few prisoners only made it through the first night before they became too emotionally distressed and had to be released. Things only went downhill from there. Though the guards could act any way they wanted as

long as they didn't physically hurt anyone, encounters quickly became cruel, hostile, and dehumanizing. Guards hurled insults and commands, referred to the prisoners only by number, and put some of them in solitary confinement. Prisoners started breaking down, others rebelled, and still others became passively resigned as if they deserved to be treated so badly. Things got bad enough that the experiment ended after only six days, causing relief in the fake prisoners, while interestingly leaving some fake guards feeling angry. Luckily, everyone involved bounced back to normal once out of the prison setting. All of those negative moods and abusive behaviors were situational, and that fact reinforced the important concept that the power of a given situation can easily override individual

differences in personality. Although it would never fly by today's ethical standards, Zimbardo's famous study remains influential today because it sheds such a harsh light on the nature of power and corruption. And yet, people differ. Many people succumb and become compliant in terrible situations, but not everyone does. Lots of people risked their lives to hide Jewish people in World War II, help runaway slaves along the Underground Railroad, keep Tutsi refugees safe during the Rwandan genocide, or generally refuse to comply or participate in actions they didn't believe in. Some people can, and do resist turning to the dark side, even when it seems like everyone around them is going mad. And yet, the fact is, these people tend to be in the minority.

So why? Why does it seem so easy to rationalize a negative action or attitude and so hard to muster the positive ones? One partial explanation comes from American social psychologist Leon Festinger's theory of cognitive dissonance. It's one of the most important concepts in psychology. Festinger's theory begins with the notion that we experience discomfort - or dissonance - when our thoughts, beliefs, or behaviors are inconsistent with each other. Basically, we don't like to confuse ourselves. For example, if Bruno was generally considered a peaceful person but finds himself suddenly punching at his friend over a fender-bender, he's likely experiencing some level of cognitive dissonance.

So, by Festinger's thinking, Bruno might relieve this tension by actually modifying his beliefs in order to match the action's he's already committed, like telling himself, "Turns out, I'm not such a nice guy after all, maybe I'm actually a bully." On the other hand, he might resolve his internal tension by changing how he thinks about the situation. He might still think of himself as a peaceful person, but realize that an unusual situation led to an unusual action, like, he'd had a bad day and it was his mom's new car, or his friend was just really askin' for it. So, he can keep being the ordinarily peaceful guy he was before. It's kind of an inverted fundamental attribution error if you think about it. Attributing a

person's actions mainly to the situation, instead of his personality. The point is that this mismatch between what we do and who we think we are induces tension - cognitive dissonance - and that we tend to want to resolve that tension. That's part of what turns an Anakin into a Darth Vader, and then, if we're lucky, back into an Anakin. Today you learned that social psychology studies how people relate to each other. We discussed Fritz Heider's attribution theory, and fundamental attribution error. You also learned how attitudes can affect actions, like through the duel-process theory of persuasion, and also how behavior can change attitudes, like through the foot-in-the-door phenomenon. The Stanford prison experiment

illustrated how a situation can override individual differences in personality, while Leon Festinger's theory of cognitive dissonance explained how we ease the tension between conflicting thoughts and actions.

### Transcript (reading)

If someone in a position of authority told you to like, stop walking on the grass, you would stop walking on the grass, right? And if they told you to help someone's grandma cross the street, or pick up your dog's poop, or put your shoes on before you go into a store, you'd probably comply. But what if they ordered you to physically hurt another person? You're probably thinking "No way! I could never do something like that." But there's a good chance you're wrong. In the early 1960s, Yale University psychologist Stanley Milgram began what would become one of social psychology's most famed and chilling experiments. Milgram began his work during the widely publicized trial of World War II Nazi war criminal Adolf

Eichmann. Eichmann's defense, along with other Nazis', for sending millions of people to their deaths, was that he was simply following the orders of his superiors. And while that may have been true, it didn't fly in court and Eichmann was ultimately executed for his crimes. But the question got Milgram to thinking, what might the average person be capable of when under orders? So, for his initial experiment, Milgram recruited forty male volunteers using newspaper ads. He built a phony "shock generator" with a scale of thirty switches that could supposedly deliver shocks in increments from 30 volts up to 450 volts, labeled with terms like "slight shock" to "dangerous shock" up to simply "XXX." He then paired each volunteer participant

with someone who was also apparently a participant, but was in fact one of Milgram's colleagues, posing as a research subject. He had them draw straws to see who would be the "learner" and who would be the "teacher." The volunteers didn't realize that the draw was fixed so that they'd always be the teacher, while Milgram's buddy would be the learner. So the fake learner was put into a room, strapped to a chair, and wired up with electrodes. The teacher, the person who was being studied, and a researcher who was played by an actor, went into another room with a shock generator that the teacher had no idea was fake. The learner was asked to memorize a list of word pairs, and the participant was told that he'd

be testing the learner's recall of those words and should administer an electric shock for every wrong answer, increasing the shock level a little bit each time. From here, the pretend learner purposely gave mainly wrong answers, eliciting shocks from the participant. If a participant hesitated, perhaps swayed by the learner's yelps of pain, the researcher gave orders to make sure he continued. These orders were delivered in a series of four prods. The first was just "Please continue," and if the participant didn't comply, the researcher issued other prods until he did. He'd say "The experiment requires you to continue" and then "It's absolutely essential that you continue" and finally "You have no choice but to continue."

Even Milgram was surprised by the first round of experiments. About two-thirds of the participants ended up delivering the maximum 450 volt shock. All of the volunteers continued to at least 300 volts. Over years, Milgram kept conducting this experiment, changing the situation in different ways to see if it had any effect on people's obedience. What he repeatedly found was that obedience was highest when the person giving the orders was nearby and was perceived as an authority figure, especially if they were from a prestigious institution. This was also true if the victim was depersonalized, or placed at a distance such as in another room. Plus, subjects were more likely to comply with the orders if they didn't see anyone else disobeying, if there were no role models of defiance.

In the end, Milgram's path-breaking work sheds some seriously harsh light on the enormous power of two of the key cornerstone topics of social psychology: social influence and We all conform to some sort of social norms, like following traffic laws or even obeying the dress codes for different roles and environments. When we know how to act in a certain group or setting, life just seems to go more smoothly. Some of this conformity is non-conscious automatic mimicry, like how you're likely to laugh if you see someone else laughing or nod your head when they're nodding. In this way, group behavior can be contagious. But overall, conformity describes how we adjust our behavior or thinking to follow the behavior

or rules of the group we belong to. Social psychologists have always been curious about the degree to which a person might follow or rebel against their group's social norms. During the early 1950s, Polish-American psychologist Solomon Ash expressed the power of conformity through a simple test. In this experiment, the volunteer is told that they're participating in a study on visual perception and is seated at a table with five other people. The experimenter shows the group a picture of a standard line and three comparison lines of various lengths, and then asked the people to say which of the three lines matches the comparison line. It's clear to anyone with any kind of good vision that the second line is the right answer, but the thing is,

most, if not all of the other people in the group start choosing the wrong line. The participant doesn't know that those other people are all actors, a common deception used in social-psychological research, and they're intentionally giving the wrong answer. This causes the real participant to struggle with trusting their own eyes or going with the group. In the end most subjects still gave what they knew was the correct answer, but more than a third were essentially just willing to give the wrong answer to mesh with the group. Ash, and subsequent researchers, found that people are more likely to conform to a group if they're made to feel incompetent or insecure and are in a group of three or more people, especially

if all those people agree. It also certainly doesn't hurt if the person admires the group because of maybe their status or their attractiveness, and if they feel that others are watching their behavior. We also tend to conform more if we're from a culture that puts particular emphasis on respect for social standards. This might sound a little bit familiar, like, all of high school, fraternities or sororities, the big company you work for, or any other group that you've ever been a part of. The classic experiments of Milgram and Ash showed us that people conform for lots of different reasons, but they both underscored the power of situation in conformity - whether that situation elicits respect for authority, fear of being different, fear of rejection,

or simply a desire for approval. This is known as normative social influence, the idea that we comply in order to fuel our need to be liked or belong. But, of course, groups influence our behavior in more ways than just conformity and obedience. For example, we may perform better or worse in front of a group. This is called social facilitation and it's what might, say, help you sprint the last hundred meters of a race if people are cheering you on, but it's also what can make you nervous enough to forget the words to that poetry you were supposed to be slamming in front of a crowd. But that's what can happen in front of a group, what happens when you're actually part of a group? Do you work harder or start slacking? One study found that if you blindfold students,

hand them a rope and tell them to pull as hard as they can in a game of tug-of-war, the subjects will put in less work if they think they're part of the team instead of pulling by themselves. About 20% less, it turns out. This tendency to exert less effort when you're not individually accountable is called social loafing. That's pretty good. You can now add the word "loafing" to your scientific vocabulary. But a group's ability to either arouse or lessen our feelings of personal responsibility can make us do more dangerous things than just phone in some group homework assignment. It can also lead to deindividuation, the loss of self-awareness and restraint that can occur in group situations. Being part of a crowd can create a powerful combination of arousal

and anonymity; it's part of what fuels riots and lynch mobs and online trolling. The less individual we feel, the more we're at the mercy of the experience of our group, whether it's good or bad. And it should come as no surprise that the attitudes and beliefs we bring to a group grow stronger when we talk with others who share them. This is a process psychologists know as group polarization, and it often translates into a nasty "us" vs "them" dynamic. And you know what is great at polarizing groups? The internet. The internet has made it easier than ever to connect like-minded people and magnify their inclinations. This can of course breed haters, like racists may become more racist in the absence of conflicting viewpoints,

but it can, and often does, work for good, promoting education, crowd-sourcing things like fundraising, and organizing people to fight all kinds of worldsuck. And group dynamics can not only affect our personal decisions, they can also influence really big decisions on a larger, even national scale. Groupthink is a term coined by social psychologist Irving Janis, to describe what happens when a group makes bad decisions because they're too caught up in the unique internal logic of their group. When a group gets wrapped up in itself and everyone agrees with each other, no one stops to think about other perspectives. As a result, you get some big and bad ideas, including some enormous historical fiascoes,

like the Watergate cover-up and the Bay of Pigs invasion and the Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident. So while two heads may often be better than one, it's important to make sure those heads are still open to different opinions or they could do some really dumb stuff. In the end, it's best to understand ourselves and our decisions as informed simultaneously by both individual and group factors, personality, and situation. And don't get too freaked out about what people are capable of; I mean, just think back to Milgram's experiment. For the two-thirds of us who would shock someone to death in the right circumstance, there's another third who wouldn't, reminding us that while group behavior is powerful, so is individual choice.

Today you learned about the power of social influence, conformity, and authority. We looked at the shocking results of the famous Milgram experiment, the concept of automatic mimicry, and how Solomon Ash proved the power of conformity in situation. You also learned how normative social influence sways us, how social facilitation can make or break your performance and how social loafing makes people lazy in a group. And finally, we discussed how harmful deindividuation, group polarization, and groupthink can be.

- [00:00] If someone in a position of authority told you to like, stop walking on the grass, you
- [00:04] would stop walking on the grass, right? And if they told you to help someone's grandma
- [00:08] cross the street, or pick up your dog's poop, or put your shoes on before you go into a
- [00:12] store, you'd probably comply.
- [00:14] But what if they ordered you to physically hurt another person? You're probably thinking
- [00:18] "No way! I could never do something like that." But there's a good chance you're wrong.
- [00:31] In the early 1960s, Yale University psychologist Stanley Milgram began what would become one
- [00:36] of social psychology's most famed and chilling experiments.
- [00:40] Milgram began his work during the widely publicized trial of World War II Nazi war criminal Adolf
- [00:45] Eichmann. Eichmann's defense, along with other Nazis', for sending millions of people to
- [00:50] their deaths, was that he was simply following the orders of his superiors. And while that
- [00:55] may have been true, it didn't fly in court and Eichmann was ultimately executed for his
- [00:59] crimes. But the question got Milgram to thinking, what might the average person be capable of
- [01:05] when under orders?
- [01:06] So, for his initial experiment, Milgram recruited forty male volunteers using newspaper ads.
- [01:11] He built a phony "shock generator" with a scale of thirty switches that could supposedly
- [01:15] deliver shocks in increments from 30 volts up to 450 volts, labeled with terms like "slight
- [01:21] shock" to "dangerous shock" up to simply "XXX." He then paired each volunteer participant
- [01:27] with someone who was also apparently a participant, but was in fact one of Milgram's colleagues,
- [01:32] posing as a research subject. He had them draw straws to see who would be the "learner"
- [01:37] and who would be the "teacher." The volunteers didn't realize that the draw was fixed so
- [01:41] that they'd always be the teacher, while Milgram's buddy would be the learner. So the fake learner
- [01:45] was put into a room, strapped to a chair, and wired up with electrodes. The teacher,
- [01:49] the person who was being studied, and a researcher who was played by an actor, went into another
- [01:54] room with a shock generator that the teacher had no idea was fake.
- [01:57] The learner was asked to memorize a list of word pairs, and the participant was told that he'd
- [02:02] be testing the learner's recall of those words and should administer an electric shock for
- [02:06] every wrong answer, increasing the shock level a little bit each time. From here, the pretend learner
- [02:11] purposely gave mainly wrong answers, eliciting shocks from the participant. If a participant
- [02:16] hesitated, perhaps swayed by the learner's yelps of pain, the researcher gave orders
- [02:22] to make sure he continued. These orders were delivered in a series of four prods.
- [02:26] The first was just "Please continue," and if the participant didn't comply, the researcher
- [02:30] issued other prods until he did. He'd say "The experiment requires you to continue"
- [02:36] and then "It's absolutely essential that you continue" and finally "You have no choice but to continue."
- [02:42] Even Milgram was surprised by the first round of experiments. About two-thirds of the participants
- [02:47] ended up delivering the maximum 450 volt shock. All of the volunteers continued to at least
- [02:53] 300 volts. Over years, Milgram kept conducting this experiment, changing the situation in
- [02:57] different ways to see if it had any effect on people's obedience. What he repeatedly
- [03:01] found was that obedience was highest when the person giving the orders was nearby and
- [03:05] was perceived as an authority figure, especially if they were from a prestigious institution.
- [03:09] This was also true if the victim was depersonalized, or placed at a distance such as in another
- [03:14] room. Plus, subjects were more likely to comply with the orders if they didn't see anyone
- [03:18] else disobeying, if there were no role models of defiance.
- [03:21] In the end, Milgram's path-breaking work sheds some seriously harsh light on the enormous
- [03:26] power of two of the key cornerstone topics of social psychology: social influence and
- [03:32] We all conform to some sort of social norms, like following traffic laws or even obeying
- [03:37] the dress codes for different roles and environments. When we know how to act in a certain group

### Transcript (reading)

Let me tell you about Robber's Cave. In 1954, a group of 11 boys, all about 12 years old, were invited to a special summer camp in the deep woods of southeastern Oklahoma, at a place called Robber's Cave State Park. None of the boys knew each other, although they all came from similar backgrounds. They spent their days bonding over things like games and swimming and treasure hunts, and in no time, they formed a tight friendly group. They even came up with a name for themselves: the Rattlers. But soon they began to notice something. No, not a guy in the woods with a hockey mask, there was another group of boys also 11 of them, also the same age, that had been staying at the other end of the park the whole time. The Rattlers never interacted with these other

boys, so they didn't know that those kids were also spending time bonding over games and swimming and treasure hunts, and that they'd come up with a name for themselves, too: the Eagles. But the Rattlers didn't like the look of the Eagles, oh, no, they didn't like them using their baseball diamond or their dining hall. And the feeling was mutual. It didn't take long for each group to start complaining to the camp's counselors about the other gang, and eventually, they both said that they wanted to set up a contest to determine once and for all which group was better. The counselors were only too happy to comply, because as I'm sure you've figured out by now, those counselors were actually researchers.

The man who set up what would be remembered as the Robber's Cave Experiment was Turkish American social psychologist Muzafer Sherif. He was interested in what it would take for rivals to overcome their differences and resolve their conflicts. Specifically, Sherif wanted to test something called Realistic Conflict Theory. He hypothesized that conflict happens when you combine negative prejudices with competition over resources, and the boys at Robber's Cave were well on their way to proving him right. Over the next couple of days, the Rattlers and the Eagles competed against each other for prizes in a series of games, like tug-of-war and foot races, and soon, what started as your basic trash talking and taunting and name-calling morphed into fist-fights, thefts,

and raids on each others' cabins. But then their dynamics changed or were changed for them. After the games were over, the researchers integrated the groups and gave the kids shared goals that they could only achieve through cooperation. The tide quickly turned. All 22 boys worked together to move a stalled truck that was carrying their food, they took care of a partially felled tree that was deemed a danger to the camp, they collaborated in setting up tents, even though they weren't given complete sets of equipment. While isolation and competition made enemies of the strangers, shared goals and cooperation turned enemies into friends. Over the past 39 weeks, we've learned a lot about ourselves, our emotions and our personalities,

how our minds can get sick, how we can help them get well again, why we can do vicious things and then turn around and act like heroes. So maybe it's fitting that we wrap up this course by looking at a couple of opposing forces that some consider the very definition of human nature: aggression and altruism. Conflict and cooperation. You might think of it as the psychology of war and peace, or simply, what we can all learn from a bunch of 12 year olds. In psychology, aggression is defined as "behavior intended to hurt or destroy someone, something, or even yourself." People aggress, as psychologists say, in all kinds of ways, verbally, emotionally, and physically, and for lots of different reasons: out of anger, to assert dominance,

or as a response to fear. But that's just a glimpse into why someone might become aggressive. Where does the aggression actually come from? Like a lot of behaviors we've talked about it, it seems to emerge from that familiar combination of biological factors, like genetic, neurological, and biochemical influences, and our environment and experience. In terms of genetic influences, studies of twins, and yes, Crash Course Psychology might have been called Crash Course Studies of Twins, showed that if one identical twin has a violent temper, often the other one does, too, but fraternal twins are much less likely to be so similar. Neurologically speaking, no single area of the brain controls aggression, but certain

areas like the limbic system do appear to facilitate it. Research on violence and criminality has also revealed a link between aggression and diminished activity in the frontal lobes, which play a vital role in impulse control. And finally, our aggressiveness can be influenced by our own biochemistry, hormones like testosterone and glucocorticoids and pheromones have all been implicated in animal models of aggression. It's a little trickier in humans, it's a lot trickier in humans, but it's highly likely that our hormones are intimately linked with feeling and showing aggression. Obviously, aggression isn't just about biology. Psychological and cultural factors also play an important role, as does the power of the situation. For example, there's the Frustration-Aggression

Hypothesis, the simple idea that people become aggressive when they're blocked from reaching a goal. To demonstrate, consider the not-very aggressive sport of baseball. There's a study that analyzed 44 years worth of baseball stats, and focused on the more than 27,000 incidents when a pitcher hit a batter with a ball. It turned out that this was most likely to occur if the pitcher was frustrated by a recent home run or if one of his own teammates had been hit by a pitch in the previous inning. But we also learn aggression by watching others. Like, if you grew up watching your parents throw popcorn and jeering lewdly at their most hated soccer team, you might have learned something from their behavior. So combine all of those biological factors and funnel

them through a particular person with a particular history in a particular situation, and you can begin to see how aggression can have many roots that grow together. Thankfully, though, humans are more than their bad tempers. While some things in people will leave us annoyed and angry, others breed friendship and affection. So yes, there are positive topics in social psychology, like altruism, our selfless, even self-sacrificing regard for the welfare of others. This could be something as simple as jumpstarting a stranger's car or as heroic as running into a burning building to save someone. But if being altruistic is so awesome, why aren't we all that way all the time? Or maybe the better question is, why do we ever do anything selfless, like, what's in it for us?

In the late 1960s, social psychologists Bibb Latane and John Darley conducted a series of experiments examining when and why we help others. In one experiment, they placed a subject in a room, sometimes alone, sometimes with two other subjects, and sometimes with two actors posing as subjects. Then, they simulated an emergency by filling the room with smoke and waited to see if the subject would do anything to alert the others or help themselves. If the subject was alone, they'd report the smoke 75% of the time. But subjects in a group of three only spoke up 38% of the time. And when they were stuck in the room with two oblivious actors, only 10% of the participants said anything to the others. Darley and Latane

found that people typically helped others only if they noticed the incident, interpreted it as an emergency, and then finally, assumed responsibility, and all of these things were much more likely to occur if a person was alone, while the presence of others deterred the person from helping. This kind of diffusion of responsibility referred to as the bystander effect, can weaken our instinct for altruism. The bystander effect is a bit like the concept of social loafing that we talked about. If you're around other people, it's easier to think that someone else is going to pick up the slack or in this case, come to the rescue. When people do decide to help others, they may do it for a number of reasons. One perspective

is that we tend to help others mainly out of self-interest. By this thinking, helping really isn't altruistic at all, and instead, our actions boil down to a sort of cost-benefit analysis. Like, maybe we'd turn in a lost wallet because we're hoping for a reward or we pitch in on a project at work because we think we'll get recognized and promoted by our bosses. Social psychologists contextualize these kinds of examples in the broader theory of social exchange. When it comes to doing things for other people, we're always trying to maximize our personal rewards while minimizing our costs. But social exchange doesn't have to be as selfish as that, it can also mean that we act altruistically because we expect

that the people we help will go on to help others, so if we give someone a hand changing a tire, maybe they'll stop next time they see someone else, maybe even us, broken down on the side of the road. You might know this concept, sometimes it's called the norm of reciprocity, sometimes it's called paying it forward. And then there's the social responsibility norm, which is the simple expectation that people will help those who depend on them, like any parent can expect to give more help than they're going to receive from young children. That's just part of being a parent. Naturally, the world would be a delightful place if altruism were the standard for human behavior, but then, psychology wouldn't be nearly so interesting.

In some ways, you might say that what fuels conflict is the opposite of altruism: self-interest. Social psychologists view conflict as any perceived incompatibility of actions, goals, or ideas. That could mean two nations fighting over a border, sparring religious or political groups, or you and your boo fighting over whose turn it is to do the dishes. And in a weird conundrum of human behavior a lot of conflicts arise from what psychologists call "a social trap," where people act in their own short term self-interest, even though it takes a toll on the larger group and on themselves over the long-term. You see this kind of thing all the time on an individual scale, like in a crime movie, when a criminal

just betrays all of his criminal friends to get the big payout, it doesn't turn out very well for him in the end. But on a larger scale, you can find social traps taking their toll on the environment, like when we poach elephants to sell their ivory or cut down old growth forests to make a quick buck in the lumber market. Either way, when self-interest succeeds in wrecking the collective interest by, say, depleting some limited resource, it becomes easy to start viewing our neighbors as competitors, taking us right back to the ingroup vs. outgroup mindset that we all know causes big problems. So as long as there's self interest, there's gonna be conflict. But before you get all down on humanity, remember those Robber's Cave boys. They were ready

to go full-on Lord of the Flies before shared goals forced them to cooperate and ultimately, make peace. The power of cooperation to make friends of former enemies is one of the most hopeful areas of psychological research. If greed and self-interest can destroy the world, perhaps cooperation can save it. Today, you learned about the Robber's Cave experiment and what it taught us about realistic conflict theory and how shared goals can overcome conflict. We looked at the physical and environmental triggers of aggression, and the frustration-aggression hypothesis. You also learned about altruism, the bystander effect, and when we are more or less likely to help a person in need, and also about the social exchange theory, the reciprocity norm, the social responsibility

norm, and social traps. Thanks for watching, especially to all of our Subbable subscribers who make Crash Course possible.

### Transcript (navigation)

- [00:00] Let me tell you about Robber's Cave. In 1954, a group of 11 boys, all about 12 years old,
- [00:05] were invited to a special summer camp in the deep woods of southeastern Oklahoma, at a
- [00:10] place called Robber's Cave State Park. None of the boys knew each other, although they
- [00:14] all came from similar backgrounds. They spent their days bonding over things like games
- [00:18] and swimming and treasure hunts, and in no time, they formed a tight friendly group.
- [00:22] They even came up with a name for themselves: the Rattlers.
- [00:25] But soon they began to notice something. No, not a guy in the woods with a hockey mask,
- [00:30] there was another group of boys also 11 of them, also the same age, that had been staying
- [00:36] at the other end of the park the whole time. The Rattlers never interacted with these other
- [00:39] boys, so they didn't know that those kids were also spending time bonding over games
- [00:44] and swimming and treasure hunts, and that they'd come up with a name for themselves,
- [00:47] too: the Eagles. But the Rattlers didn't like the look of the Eagles, oh, no, they didn't
- [00:52] like them using their baseball diamond or their dining hall.
- [00:55] And the feeling was mutual. It didn't take long for each group to start complaining to
- [00:59] the camp's counselors about the other gang, and eventually, they both said that they wanted
- [01:03] to set up a contest to determine once and for all which group was better. The counselors
- [01:07] were only too happy to comply, because as I'm sure you've figured out by now, those
- [01:11] counselors were actually researchers.
- [01:13] The man who set up what would be remembered as the Robber's Cave Experiment was Turkish
- [01:17] American social psychologist Muzafer Sherif. He was interested in what it would take for
- [01:21] rivals to overcome their differences and resolve their conflicts. Specifically, Sherif wanted
- [01:26] to test something called Realistic Conflict Theory. He hypothesized that conflict happens
- [01:31] when you combine negative prejudices with competition over resources, and the boys at
- [01:35] Robber's Cave were well on their way to proving him right.
- [01:38] Over the next couple of days, the Rattlers and the Eagles competed against each other
- [01:41] for prizes in a series of games, like tug-of-war and foot races, and soon, what started as
- [01:47] your basic trash talking and taunting and name-calling morphed into fist-fights, thefts,
- [01:52] and raids on each others' cabins. But then their dynamics changed or were changed for them.
- [01:57] After the games were over, the researchers integrated the groups and gave the kids shared
- [02:01] goals that they could only achieve through cooperation. The tide quickly turned. All
- [02:06] 22 boys worked together to move a stalled truck that was carrying their food, they took
- [02:10] care of a partially felled tree that was deemed a danger to the camp, they collaborated in
- [02:15] setting up tents, even though they weren't given complete sets of equipment. While isolation
- [02:20] and competition made enemies of the strangers, shared goals and cooperation turned enemies into friends.
- [02:26] Over the past 39 weeks, we've learned a lot about ourselves, our emotions and our personalities,
- [02:31] how our minds can get sick, how we can help them get well again, why we can do vicious
- [02:37] things and then turn around and act like heroes. So maybe it's fitting that we wrap up this
- [02:40] course by looking at a couple of opposing forces that some consider the very definition
- [02:44] of human nature: aggression and altruism. Conflict and cooperation. You might think
- [02:50] of it as the psychology of war and peace, or simply,  what we can all learn from a bunch of 12 year olds.
- [03:05] In psychology, aggression is defined as "behavior intended to hurt or destroy someone, something,
- [03:11] or even yourself." People aggress, as psychologists say, in all kinds of ways, verbally, emotionally,
- [03:17] and physically, and for lots of different reasons: out of anger, to assert dominance,
- [03:22] or as a response to fear. But that's just a glimpse into why someone might become aggressive.
- [03:27] Where does the aggression actually come from?
- [03:29] Like a lot of behaviors we've talked about it, it seems to emerge from that familiar
- [03:32] combination of biological factors, like genetic, neurological, and biochemical influences,
- [03:37] and our environment and experience. In terms of genetic influences, studies of twins, and
- [03:42] yes, Crash Course Psychology might have been called Crash Course Studies of Twins, showed
- [03:46] that if one identical twin has a violent temper, often the other one does, too, but fraternal
- [03:50] twins are much less likely to be so similar.
- [03:53] Neurologically speaking, no single area of the brain controls aggression, but certain
- [03:57] areas like the limbic system do appear to facilitate it. Research on violence and criminality
- [04:01] has also revealed a link between aggression and diminished activity in the frontal lobes,
- [04:05] which play a vital role in impulse control.
- [04:08] And finally, our aggressiveness can be influenced by our own biochemistry, hormones like testosterone
- [04:13] and glucocorticoids and pheromones have all been implicated in animal models of aggression.
- [04:17] It's a little trickier in humans, it's a lot trickier in humans, but it's highly likely
- [04:21] that our hormones are intimately linked with feeling and showing aggression.
- [04:24] Obviously, aggression isn't just about biology. Psychological and cultural factors also play
- [04:29] an important role, as does the power of the situation. For example, there's the Frustration-Aggression
- [04:34] Hypothesis, the simple idea that people become aggressive when they're blocked from reaching
- [04:38] a goal. To demonstrate, consider the not-very aggressive sport of baseball. There's a study
- [04:42] that analyzed 44 years worth of baseball stats, and focused on the more than 27,000 incidents
- [04:47] when a pitcher hit a batter with a ball. It turned out that this was most likely to occur
- [04:51] if the pitcher was frustrated by a recent home run or if one of his own teammates had
- [04:55] been hit by a pitch in the previous inning.
- [04:57] But we also learn aggression by watching others. Like, if you grew up watching your parents
- [05:01] throw popcorn and jeering lewdly at their most hated soccer team, you might have learned
- [05:05] something from their behavior. So combine all of those biological factors and funnel
- [05:09] them through a particular person with a particular history in a particular situation, and you
- [05:14] can begin to see how aggression can have many roots that grow together.
- [05:18] Thankfully, though, humans are more than their bad tempers. While some things in people will
- [05:21] leave us annoyed and angry, others breed friendship and affection. So yes, there are positive
- [05:26] topics in social psychology, like altruism, our selfless, even self-sacrificing regard
- [05:32] for the welfare of others. This could be something as simple as jumpstarting a stranger's car
- [05:36] or as heroic as running into a burning building to save someone. But if being altruistic is
- [05:40] so awesome, why aren't we all that way all the time? Or maybe the better question is,
- [05:45] why do we ever do anything selfless, like, what's in it for us?
- [05:49] In the late 1960s, social psychologists Bibb Latane and John Darley conducted a series
- [05:53] of experiments examining when and why we help others. In one experiment, they placed a subject
- [05:58] in a room, sometimes alone, sometimes with two other subjects, and sometimes with two
- [06:02] actors posing as subjects. Then, they simulated an emergency by filling the room with smoke
- [06:08] and waited to see if the subject would do anything to alert the others or help themselves.
- [06:12] If the subject was alone, they'd report the smoke 75% of the time. But subjects in a group
- [06:17] of three only spoke up 38% of the time. And when they were stuck in the room with two
- [06:20] oblivious actors, only 10% of the participants said anything to the others. Darley and Latane
- [06:26] found that people typically helped others only if they noticed the incident, interpreted
- [06:31] it as an emergency, and then finally, assumed responsibility, and all of these things were
- [06:35] much more likely to occur if a person was alone, while the presence of others deterred
- [06:40] the person from helping.
- [06:41] This kind of diffusion of responsibility referred to as the bystander effect, can weaken our
- [06:46] instinct for altruism. The bystander effect is a bit like the concept of social loafing
- [06:50] that we talked about. If you're around other people, it's easier to think that someone
- [06:54] else is going to pick up the slack or in this case, come to the rescue.
- [06:57] When people do decide to help others, they may do it for a number of reasons. One perspective
- [07:01] is that we tend to help others mainly out of self-interest. By this thinking, helping
- [07:05] really isn't altruistic at all, and instead, our actions boil down to a sort of cost-benefit
- [07:10] analysis. Like, maybe we'd turn in a lost wallet because we're hoping for a reward or
- [07:14] we pitch in on a project at work because we think we'll get recognized and promoted by
- [07:18] our bosses. Social psychologists contextualize these kinds of examples in the broader theory
- [07:23] of social exchange. When it comes to doing things for other people, we're always trying
- [07:26] to maximize our personal rewards while minimizing our costs. But social exchange doesn't have
- [07:30] to be as selfish as that, it can also mean that we act altruistically because we expect
- [07:34] that the people we help will go on to help others, so if we give someone a hand changing
- [07:38] a tire, maybe they'll stop next time they see someone else, maybe even us, broken down
- [07:42] on the side of the road. You might know this concept, sometimes it's called the norm of
- [07:46] reciprocity, sometimes it's called paying it forward.
- [07:48] And then there's the social responsibility norm, which is the simple expectation that
- [07:52] people will help those who depend on them, like any parent can expect to give more help
- [07:57] than they're going to receive from young children. That's just part of being a parent. Naturally,
- [08:01] the world would be a delightful place if altruism were the standard for human behavior, but
- [08:06] then, psychology wouldn't be nearly so interesting.
- [08:09] In some ways, you might say that what fuels conflict is the opposite of altruism: self-interest.
- [08:14] Social psychologists view conflict as any perceived incompatibility of actions, goals,
- [08:19] or ideas. That could mean two nations fighting over a border, sparring religious or political
- [08:24] groups, or you and your boo fighting over whose turn it is to do the dishes.
- [08:27] And in a weird conundrum of human behavior a lot of conflicts arise from what psychologists
- [08:31] call "a social trap," where people act in their own short term self-interest, even though
- [08:36] it takes a toll on the larger group and on themselves over the long-term. You see this
- [08:40] kind of thing all the time on an individual scale, like in a crime movie, when a criminal
- [08:43] just betrays all of his criminal friends to get the big payout, it doesn't turn out very
- [08:48] well for him in the end. But on a larger scale, you can find social traps taking their toll
- [08:52] on the environment, like when we poach elephants to sell their ivory or cut down old growth
- [08:57] forests to make a quick buck in the lumber market. Either way, when self-interest succeeds
- [09:01] in wrecking the collective interest by, say, depleting some limited resource, it becomes
- [09:05] easy to start viewing our neighbors as competitors, taking us right back to the ingroup vs. outgroup
- [09:11] mindset that we all know causes big problems.
- [09:14] So as long as there's self interest, there's gonna be conflict.
- [09:17] But before you get all down on humanity, remember those Robber's Cave boys. They were ready
- [09:21] to go full-on Lord of the Flies before shared goals forced them to cooperate and ultimately,
- [09:27] make peace. The power of cooperation to make friends of former enemies is one of the most
- [09:31] hopeful areas of psychological research. If greed and self-interest can destroy the world,
- [09:36] perhaps cooperation can save it.
- [09:38] Today, you learned about the Robber's Cave experiment and what it taught us about realistic

What do you see in this image? A scary face? A couple of squirrels fighting? Or this one? A squashed frog? Or tumbling poodles? A bleeding bat? Hermann Rorschach wants to know. Eh, he wanted to know–he's dead now He believed that your answers, what you saw in the ink, said something about your personality. Rorschach was a Swiss psychoanalyst who, in his youth, was fascinated by the childhood game of making pictures out of inkblots called klecksography As an adult, Rorschach was intrigued with Carl Jung's use of word association in attempts to access patients' unconscious minds. Jung would ask patients to say the first thing that came to mind when they saw words like "dead" or "window" or "abuse" and Rorschach thought, "Why not do the same thing with amorphous blobs?"

So he'd show a patient a series of ink blots and record what they saw to determine how people "projected" their personal associations onto random shapes. Assuming there are important differences between those who saw dancing bunnies versus those who saw severed, screaming heads, he drew conclusions about a patient's personality. And yeah, this was controversial. Some clinicians still do think that Rorschach test can be a helpful diagnostic tool when used correctly and cautiously. But others remain critical of the test, calling them unscientific and unreliable. It's even been called "the Dracula of psychological tests" because no one has been able to drive a stake through its heart yet.

So I guess this is that part when I apologize for the set design. Sorry. But love it or hate it, the Rorschach test is one of the many methods psychologists have used in an ongoing quest to understand personality. And of all of the concepts we cover in this course, personality is one of the most complex, and one of the most contested. This is where we bring in the household names. Not just Rorschach, but Freud, and Jung, as well as other influential thinkers like Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers. It's where some of the most familiar concepts in early psychology come into play, ones that people with even passing knowledge of the field have heard of: the ego, the Oedipus complex, penis envy, inferiority complexes, even the idea of self-help itself.

Whether you've heard of these as hard facts or simply as historical curiosities, these notions represent the starting points for some of the biggest and most compelling questions in the field. But they all come back to the same question: What makes us who we are? ♪ [Crash Course intro] ♪ We always gotta start out with defining things. Personality. You think you know what that means, but we're gonna define it as your distinctive and enduring characteristic patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving. And psychologists typically study personality in two broad ways: 1. By trying to understand differences in specific characteristics, like introvertedness versus extrovertedness.

And 2. By looking at how all the various parts of each person mesh together as a whole. Basically, what are our characteristics and how do they combine to make me me and you you? And guess what? As you might expect, there are a number of competing perspectives on personality theory. 4 to be exact. The first, and one of the most influential has been the psychoanalytic perspective, first championed by our coke-loving, cigar-chewing friend, Sigmund Freud. It was through his clinical observation of patients that Freud came to theorize the existence of the unconscious. For Freud, the unconscious represented a vast reservoir of often unacceptable and frequently hard-to-tolerate thoughts, feelings, desires, and memories.

Usually involving a lots of weird sex stuff. You gotta point out, by the way, that the Freudian unconscious is a different thing from the contemporary idea of non-conscious information processing when we're, like, processing information that we don't know we're processing. Freud's thing is, you know, a lot more titillating, but, the non-conscious is like empirically validated a real thing that we study now. Anyway, Freud believed that our personalities are largely shaped by the enduring conflict between our impulses to do whatever we feel like, and our restraint to control those urges between our pleasure-seeking aggressive urges and our inner social control over them. He theorized our minds as being divided into three interacting parts— the id, the ego, and the superego—

that provide the battleground for this internal conflict that shaped our personalities. You can think of the classic Freudian mind like this iceberg. It's mostly hidden, and that big underwater chunk is your id: your unconscious, primitive, and instinctive self. Freud thought the id was all about sex and agression, the so-called pleasure principle of immediate gratification. To him, infants were all id. That's in part why babies freak out when they don't get a snack like "Right now!", instead of just taking a deep breath for a second. For that matter, a lot of the off-the-wall celebrities and dictators are big ids. The id's like a honey badger—they don't care. Eventually kids develop the ego part of their personality,

that largely conscious component that's charged with dealing with reality. The ego works on getting the id what it wants in a reasonable, timely, and realistic way without, you know, getting arrested or beaten up. The final aspect to form in Freud's personality trifecta is the superego, the Jiminy Cricket of voice of our conscience that represents not just the real, but also the ideal. As you can imagine, the superego and the id don't much like each other, and it's up the the Referee Ego to sort everything out. And it's hard to be the ego. Freud believed that anxiety comes in part from the ego getting all stressed out about losing control over the id and superego. So he proposed that our egos use a series of indirect and unconscious defense mechanisms to protect themselves from this fear.

And each person's particular configuration of defense mechanisms, in turn, makes up part of what we're referring to here as personality. You might already have heard of repression, the defense that's thought to work by banishing any thoughts, feelings, or memories that cause anxiety to the unconscious. And repression, Freud thought, allows our many other defense mechanisms to do their work. Regression, for example, involves a retreat to a more infantile psychosexual stage, like, when a second-grader sucks their thumb when they're nervous. Reaction formation is kinda like passive-aggression. It involves flipping unacceptable impulses like desire to punch someone in the face with their opposites, like offering them cookies with a fake smile.

Projection is when you disguise your own impulses by calling them out in other people, and rationalization is just what it sounds like, when we offer explanations and excuses for our behaviors instead of getting to the real unconscious reasons. Like, "Yeah, well, I ate six hot pockets at the party just 'cause I was being social!" Displacement is the typical you got yelled at by your boss, and then came home and yelled at your roommate. It's when you shift your impulses toward a less threatening victim. And then there's denial, which is when you refuse to believe or sometimes even perceive some kind of painful reality. Like, "No, my boyfriend isn't cheating on me." and "I'm not gonna fail that class," and "These pants TOTALLY STILL FIT!"

Our defense mechanisms, as theorized by Freud, are pretty tied in with our personalities. Someone who engages in a lot of denial and not as much projection would probably look and act a lot differently from someone who chronically does the reverse. Still, Freud was convince our personalities form in our first few years as we pass through a series of five psychosexual stages, essentially during which the id seeks to get its rocks off in different pleasure-sensitive areas. Infants start out in the oral stage because they get pleasure from eating. From there, a child enters the anal stage, focused on peeing and pooping; then on to the phallic stage, as they discover their boy and girl bits.

It was during this stage that Freud believed the infamous Oedipus complex reared up, characterized by a boy experiencing a form of sexual desire toward his mother and a parallel jealousy or hatred of his father. Freud called from about age 6 to puberty the latency stage, marked by dormant sexual feelings which eventually evolved into the fifth and final, adult, genital stage of mature sexual interests. Now, he believed if certain conflicts weren't resolved in any of these given stages, a person could develop a fixation, or a lingering focus on a younger stage. Like if a baby was overfed or neglected and underfed, they might be fixate in the oral stage; an orally fixated adult might seek oral gratification through excessive eating or chain smoking

and may develop issues with dependency or aggression. Now of course, not everyone was on board with Freud's model of personality development. Many of his ideas were controversial and remain so to this day; even most modern psychoanalysts now dispute the whole Oedipal thing. In fact, while many pioneering psychoanalysts built on Freud's theories -- these are so-called neo-Freudians -- many disagree with lots of his ideas, and instead either emphasize the role of the conscious mind or focus on non-sexual motivations. Take Karen Horney, for instance, a German-born psychoanalyst credited with founding feminist psychology. She wasn't down with the idea that our personalities are primarily shaped by sex and aggression.

She especially rejected the notion of penis envy, which she thought was more than a little insulting to women. She actually proposed that womb envy may occur as much in men who were envious they can't give birth. She encouraged patients to take charge of their own mental health and engage in self-help and analysis, believing people were often able to sorta be their own therapists. We mentioned Carl Jung, the famous Swiss psychoanalyst. Jung was a friend and disciple of Freud, but eventually, theoretical differences took them in different directions. He agreed that the unconscious was a powerful force, but he believed it was more than just a holding cell for repressed sexual thoughts and feelings and memories.

Jung believed sexual drive was only part of the equation, and that we're also driven by a need to achieve a full knowledge of self. He also suggested that we have a collective unconscious, a group of shared images or archetypes that are universal to all humans, and this was why different cultures share similar myths and imagery. Vienna-born Alfred Adler was another former collaborator of Freud who struck out on his own. Adler agreed with Freud that childhood was important, but he emphasized ongoing social tensions, not sexual ones, as most crucial to the formation of personality. He coined the term "inferiority complex" and believed that much of our adult behavior is linked to childhood struggles with feeling inferior.

In the end, not all of their their theories have endured, but Freud and his contemporaries were key to the evolution of psychoanalytic theory because they explored ways in which our mental life and personality may be submerged beneath the veil of consciousness. But the psychoanalytical approach is only one perspective on what makes us who we are. Rather than focuseing on how messed up we can be, humanistic theorists focus on the basic goodness of people and how they strive to achieve their full potential. In other words, they believe in the potential for personal growth. Abraham Maslow is one of these guys; he believed we're motivated by that pyramid-shaped hierarchy of needs and that once basic needs are met, like food and shelter and whatnot, we're able to achieve higher goals.

Maslow believed the top two rungs of that pyramid are where the real growth in personality takes place. First, with self-actualization, or the need to live up to our full, unique potential, and then with self-transcendence, or finding meaning and purpose and identity beyond ourselves. Rather than study only troubled patients, Maslow look at healthy, creative types with whom he discovered this common thread of self-actualization. Bolstered by a secure sense of self, these people were more sure of themselves, more compassionate, caring, driven, and uneasy around cruelty and pettiness. American psychologist, Carl Rogers, was another pioneer of humanistic theory, who proposed a person-centered perspective on personality.

Like Maslow, Rogers believed we're all basically good eggs so long as we're nurtured in a growth-promoting environment that he thought required three conditions. The first is genuineness. Just the idea that parents and teachers should be transparent and open with their feelings. Then, there's acceptance; when folks are accepting, people around them won't be afraid to be themselves or make mistakes. And the third requirement, according to Rogers, is empathy, or the ability to share others' feelings and reflect their meanings. Rogers thought of these traits as the nutrients required to make a personality grow into a healthy self-concept, that mix of thoughts and feelings that answer the fundamental question, who am I?

So, psychoanalytic and humanistic theories of personality were and are incredibly influential, even if one was a little sorted, and the other, a little sunshine and rainbows. But they didn't always lend themselves to clear measurement, and as empirical standards began to take hold in the mid-20th century, this became a major concern. How did we deal with that? Well, tune in next week when we explore some of the newer ways of looking at personality and how we started measuring it. Today, you learned about personality theory and two of its early schools of thought: the psychoanalytic theory, including Freud's three-part model of the mind and defense mechanisms, along with the neo-Freudians.

You also learned about the humanistic theory, including Maslow's model of self-actualization and Roger's person-centered perspective.

- [00:36] "dead"
- [00:36] or "window"
- [00:37] or "abuse"
- [00:38] and Rorschach thought,
- [00:39] "Why not do the same thing with amorphous blobs?"
- [00:41] So he'd show a patient a series of ink blots and record what they saw
- [00:45] to determine how people "projected" their personal associations onto random shapes.
- [00:49] Assuming there are important differences between those who saw
- [00:52] dancing bunnies versus those who saw severed, screaming heads,
- [00:55] he drew conclusions about a patient's personality.
- [00:58] And yeah, this was controversial.
- [01:00] Some clinicians still do think that Rorschach test can be a helpful diagnostic tool
- [01:03] when used correctly and cautiously.
- [01:06] But others remain critical of the test, calling them unscientific and unreliable.
- [01:10] It's even been called "the Dracula of psychological tests"
- [01:13] because no one has been able to drive a stake through its heart yet.
- [01:16] So I guess this is that part when I apologize for the set design.
- [01:19] Sorry.
- [01:20] But love it or hate it, the Rorschach test is one of the many methods
- [01:22] psychologists have used in an ongoing quest to understand personality.
- [01:26] And of all of the concepts we cover in this course, personality is one of the most complex,
- [01:30] and one of the most contested.
- [01:32] This is where we bring in the household names.
- [01:34] Not just Rorschach, but Freud, and Jung,
- [01:36] as well as other influential thinkers like Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers.
- [01:41] It's where some of the most familiar concepts in early psychology come into play,
- [01:43] ones that people with even passing knowledge of the field have heard of:
- [01:47] the ego, the Oedipus complex, penis envy, inferiority complexes, even the idea of self-help itself.
- [01:53] Whether you've heard of these as hard facts or simply as historical curiosities,
- [01:57] these notions represent the starting points for some of the biggest and most compelling questions in the field.
- [02:02] But they all come back to the same question:
- [02:04] What makes us who we are?
- [02:07] ♪ [Crash Course intro] ♪
- [02:16] We always gotta start out with defining things. Personality. You think you know what that means,
- [02:21] but we're gonna define it as your distinctive and enduring characteristic patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving.
- [02:26] And psychologists typically study personality in two broad ways:
- [02:29] 1. By trying to understand differences in specific characteristics,
- [02:33] like introvertedness versus extrovertedness.
- [02:36] And 2. By looking at how all the various parts of each person mesh together as a whole.
- [02:40] Basically, what are our characteristics and how do they combine to make me me and you you?
- [02:46] And guess what?
- [02:47] As you might expect, there are a number of competing perspectives on personality theory.
- [02:52] 4 to be exact.
- [02:53] The first, and one of the most influential has been the psychoanalytic perspective,
- [02:56] first championed by our coke-loving, cigar-chewing friend, Sigmund Freud.
- [03:00] It was through his clinical observation of patients that
- [03:02] Freud came to theorize the existence of the unconscious.
- [03:05] For Freud, the unconscious represented a vast reservoir
- [03:08] of often unacceptable and frequently hard-to-tolerate thoughts, feelings, desires, and memories.
- [03:13] Usually involving a lots of weird sex stuff.
- [03:16] You gotta point out, by the way,
- [03:16] that the Freudian unconscious is a different thing
- [03:19] from the contemporary idea of non-conscious information processing
- [03:22] when we're, like, processing information that we don't know we're processing.
- [03:26] Freud's thing is, you know, a lot more titillating,
- [03:28] but, the non-conscious is like empirically validated a real thing that we study now.
- [03:33] Anyway, Freud believed that our personalities are largely shaped by the enduring conflict
- [03:37] between our impulses to do whatever we feel like, and our restraint to control those urges
- [03:42] between our pleasure-seeking aggressive urges and our inner social control over them.
- [03:47] He theorized our minds as being divided into three interacting parts—
- [03:51] the id, the ego, and the superego—
- [03:53] that provide the battleground for this internal conflict that shaped our personalities.
- [03:58] You can think of the classic Freudian mind like this iceberg.
- [04:00] It's mostly hidden, and that big underwater chunk is your id:
- [04:04] your unconscious, primitive, and instinctive self.
- [04:07] Freud thought the id was all about sex and agression,
- [04:09] the so-called pleasure principle of immediate gratification.
- [04:13] To him, infants were all id.
- [04:15] That's in part why babies freak out when they don't get a snack like "Right now!",
- [04:19] instead of just taking a deep breath for a second.
- [04:21] For that matter, a lot of the off-the-wall celebrities and dictators are big ids.
- [04:25] The id's like a honey badger—they don't care.
- [04:27] Eventually kids develop the ego part of their personality,
- [04:30] that largely conscious component that's charged with dealing with reality.
- [04:34] The ego works on getting the id what it wants in a reasonable, timely, and realistic way
- [04:38] without, you know, getting arrested or beaten up.
- [04:41] The final aspect to form in Freud's personality trifecta is the superego,
- [04:45] the Jiminy Cricket of voice of our conscience that represents not just the real, but also the ideal.
- [04:50] As you can imagine, the superego and the id don't much like each other,
- [04:53] and it's up the the Referee Ego to sort everything out.
- [04:56] And it's hard to be the ego.
- [04:57] Freud believed that anxiety comes in part from the ego getting all stressed out about losing control
- [05:02] over the id and superego.
- [05:03] So he proposed that our egos use a series of indirect and unconscious defense mechanisms
- [05:08] to protect themselves from this fear.
- [05:09] And each person's particular configuration of defense mechanisms, in turn,
- [05:13] makes up part of what we're referring to here as personality.
- [05:17] You might already have heard of repression,
- [05:18] the defense that's thought to work by banishing any thoughts, feelings, or memories
- [05:22] that cause anxiety to the unconscious.
- [05:24] And repression, Freud thought, allows our many other defense mechanisms to do their work.
- [05:28] Regression, for example, involves a retreat to a more infantile psychosexual stage,
- [05:33] like, when a second-grader sucks their thumb when they're nervous.
- [05:36] Reaction formation is kinda like passive-aggression.
- [05:38] It involves flipping unacceptable impulses like desire to punch someone in the face
- [05:42] with their opposites, like offering them cookies with a fake smile.
- [05:46] Projection is when you disguise your own impulses by calling them out in other people,
- [05:50] and rationalization is just what it sounds like, when we offer explanations and excuses for our behaviors
- [05:55] instead of getting to the real unconscious reasons.
- [05:57] Like, "Yeah, well, I ate six hot pockets at the party just 'cause I was being social!"
- [06:02] Displacement is the typical you got yelled at by your boss, and then came home and yelled at your roommate.
- [06:06] It's when you shift your impulses toward a less threatening victim.
- [06:10] And then there's denial,
- [06:11] which is when you refuse to believe or sometimes even perceive some kind of painful reality.
- [06:16] Like, "No, my boyfriend isn't cheating on me."
- [06:18] and "I'm not gonna fail that class,"
- [06:19] and "These pants TOTALLY STILL FIT!"
- [06:21] Our defense mechanisms, as theorized by Freud, are pretty tied in with our personalities.
- [06:25] Someone who engages in a lot of denial and not as much projection would probably look and act
- [06:29] a lot differently from someone who chronically does the reverse.
- [06:32] Still, Freud was convince our personalities form in our first few years as we pass
- [06:36] through a series of five psychosexual stages,
- [06:39] essentially during which the id seeks to get its rocks off in different pleasure-sensitive areas.
- [06:43] Infants start out in the oral stage because they get pleasure from eating.
- [06:47] From there, a child enters the anal stage, focused on peeing and pooping;
- [06:50] then on to the phallic stage, as they discover their boy and girl bits.
- [06:54] It was during this stage that Freud believed the infamous Oedipus complex reared up,
- [06:57] characterized by a boy experiencing a form of sexual desire toward his mother
- [07:01] and a parallel jealousy or hatred of his father.
- [07:04] Freud called from about age 6 to puberty the latency stage, marked by dormant sexual feelings
- [07:09] which eventually evolved into the fifth and final, adult, genital stage of mature sexual interests.
- [07:14] Now, he believed if certain conflicts weren't resolved in any of these given stages,
- [07:18] a person could develop a fixation, or a lingering focus on a younger stage.
- [07:22] Like if a baby was overfed or neglected and underfed, they might be fixate in the oral stage;
- [07:27] an orally fixated adult might seek oral gratification through excessive eating or chain smoking
- [07:32] and may develop issues with dependency or aggression.
- [07:34] Now of course, not everyone was on board with Freud's model of personality development.
- [07:38] Many of his ideas were controversial and remain so to this day;
- [07:41] even most modern psychoanalysts now dispute the whole Oedipal thing.
- [07:44] In fact, while many pioneering psychoanalysts built on Freud's theories -- these are so-called neo-Freudians --
- [07:50] many disagree with lots of his ideas, and instead either emphasize the role of the conscious mind
- [07:55] or focus on non-sexual motivations.
- [07:57] Take Karen Horney, for instance,
- [07:59] a German-born psychoanalyst credited with founding feminist psychology.
- [08:03] She wasn't down with the idea that our personalities are primarily shaped by sex and aggression.
- [08:08] She especially rejected the notion of penis envy,
- [08:10] which she thought was more than a little insulting to women.
- [08:13] She actually proposed that womb envy may occur as much in men who were envious they can't give birth.
- [08:18] She encouraged patients to take charge of their own mental health and engage in self-help and analysis,
- [08:23] believing people were often able to sorta be their own therapists.
- [08:26] We mentioned Carl Jung, the famous Swiss psychoanalyst.
- [08:28] Jung was a friend and disciple of Freud, but eventually, theoretical differences took them in different directions.
- [08:33] He agreed that the unconscious was a powerful force,
- [08:35] but he believed it was more than just a holding cell for repressed sexual thoughts and feelings and memories.
- [08:40] Jung believed sexual drive was only part of the equation,
- [08:42] and that we're also driven by a need to achieve a full knowledge of self.
- [08:46] He also suggested that we have a collective unconscious,
- [08:49] a group of shared images or archetypes that are universal to all humans,
- [08:54] and this was why different cultures share similar myths and imagery.
- [08:57] Vienna-born Alfred Adler was another former collaborator of Freud who struck out on his own.
- [09:01] Adler agreed with Freud that childhood was important,
- [09:03] but he emphasized ongoing social tensions, not sexual ones, as most crucial to the formation of personality.
- [09:09] He coined the term "inferiority complex"
- [09:10] and believed that much of our adult behavior is linked to childhood struggles with feeling inferior.
- [09:15] In the end, not all of their their theories have endured,
- [09:17] but Freud and his contemporaries were key to the evolution of psychoanalytic theory
- [09:21] because they explored ways in which our mental life and personality
- [09:25] may be submerged beneath the veil of consciousness.
- [09:27] But the psychoanalytical approach
- [09:29] is only one perspective on what makes us who we are.
- [09:32] Rather than focuseing on how messed up we can be,
- [09:34] humanistic theorists focus on the basic goodness of people and how they strive to achieve their full potential.
- [09:40] In other words, they believe in the potential for personal growth.
- [09:43] Abraham Maslow is one of these guys;
- [09:44] he believed we're motivated by that pyramid-shaped hierarchy of needs
- [09:48] and that once basic needs are met, like food and shelter and whatnot, we're able to achieve higher goals.
- [09:53] Maslow believed the top two rungs of that pyramid are where the real growth in personality takes place.
- [09:58] First, with self-actualization, or the need to live up to our full, unique potential,
- [10:03] and then with self-transcendence, or finding meaning and purpose and identity beyond ourselves.
- [10:08] Rather than study only troubled patients,
- [10:10] Maslow look at healthy, creative types
- [10:12] with whom he discovered this common thread of self-actualization.
- [10:16] Bolstered by a secure sense of self,
- [10:18] these people were more sure of themselves, more compassionate, caring, driven,
- [10:22] and uneasy around cruelty and pettiness.
- [10:24] American psychologist, Carl Rogers, was another pioneer of humanistic theory,
- [10:27] who proposed a person-centered perspective on personality.
- [10:30] Like Maslow, Rogers believed we're all basically good eggs
- [10:34] so long as we're nurtured in a growth-promoting environment that he thought required three conditions.
- [10:39] The first is genuineness.
- [10:40] Just the idea that parents and teachers should be transparent and open with their feelings.
- [10:44] Then, there's acceptance; when folks are accepting,
- [10:46] people around them won't be afraid to be themselves or make mistakes.
- [10:50] And the third requirement, according to Rogers,
- [10:52] is empathy, or the ability to share others' feelings and reflect their meanings.
- [10:56] Rogers thought of these traits as the nutrients required to make a personality grow into a healthy self-concept,
- [11:02] that mix of thoughts and feelings that answer the fundamental question, who am I?
- [11:06] So, psychoanalytic and humanistic theories of personality were and are incredibly influential,
- [11:11] even if one was a little sorted, and the other, a little sunshine and rainbows.
- [11:15] But they didn't always lend themselves to clear measurement,
- [11:17] and as empirical standards began to take hold in the mid-20th century, this became a major concern.
- [11:22] How did we deal with that? Well, tune in next week when we explore some of the newer ways
- [11:26] of looking at personality and how we started measuring it.
- [11:29] Today, you learned about personality theory and two of its early schools of thought:
- [11:34] the psychoanalytic theory, including Freud's three-part model of the mind and defense mechanisms,
- [11:39] along with the neo-Freudians.
- [11:41] You also learned about the humanistic theory,
- [11:43] including Maslow's model of self-actualization and Roger's person-centered perspective.

how would you describe your personality may be friendly creative quirky what about nervous or timid or outgoing but has anyone ever called you a sanguine what about a cava or full of metal ancient Greek physician Hippocrates believed personality manifested itself in four different humors and basically you are who you are because of your balance of phlegm blood and yellow and black bile according to traditional Chinese medicine our personalities depend on the balance of five elements earth wind water metal and fire those who practice traditional Hindu Ayurvedic medicine view each other as unique combinations of three different mind-body principles called doshas but Sigmund Freud thought our personalities depended in part on who's winning the

battle of urges between the Ede ego and super-ego meanwhile humanistic psychologist Abraham Maslow suggested that the key to self-actualization was first successfully climbing a hierarchy of more basic needs and then you got your BuzzFeed quizzes to determine what kind of pirate der font or sandwich or Harry Potter character you are but I would never take one of those seriously all this is to say the people have been characterizing one another for a long long time and whether you're into blood or bile or ego or it or blt or PB&J there are a lot of ways to describe and measure a personality and all these theories all the years of research and cigar-smoking an inkblot gazing in the fans debating whether they're more of a Luke or Leia they're all funneling down

the one big central question who or what is the self last week we talked about how psychologists often study personality by examining the differences between characteristics and by looking at how these various characteristics combine to create a whole thinking feeling person the early psychoanalytic and humanistic theorists had a lot of ideas about personality but some psychologists questioned their lack of clearly measurable standards like there was no way to really quantify someone's inkblot response or how orally fixated they might be so this drive to find a more empirical approach spawned two more popular theories in the 20th century known as the trait and social cognitive perspective instead of focusing on things like lingering unconscious influences or missed growth

opportunities trait theory researchers look to define personality through stable and lasting behavior patterns and conscious motivations legend has it that it all began in 1919 when young American psychologist Gordon Allport paid a visit to none other than Freud himself Allport was telling Freud about his journey there on the train and how there was this little boy who was obsessed with staying clean and didn't want to sit next to anyone or touch anything Albert wondered if the boy's mother had a kind of dirt phobia that had rubbed off on him so yeah yeah yeah he's telling his tale and at the end of it Freud looks at him and says hmm was that little boy you all port was basically like no man that was just some kid on the train don't try to make this into

some big unconscious episode from my repressed childhood Allport thought Freud was digging a little too deep and that sometimes you just need to look at motives in the present not the past to describe behavior so all-ports started his own Club describing personality in terms of fundamental traits or characteristics and conscious motives it wasn't so much interested in explaining traits as he was in describing them modern trait researchers like Robert McRae and Paul Costa have since organized our fundamental characteristics into what's casually known as the big five openness conscientiousness extraversion agreeableness and neuroticism which you can remember using the mnemonic ocean or canoe whichever one you prefer each of these traits exists on a spectrum so for example your level of

openness can range on one end from being totally open to new things in variety or one thing strict regular routine on the other end your degree of conscientiousness can translate into being impulsive and care lists are careful and disciplined someone high on the extraversion in will be sociable while those on the low end will be shy and reserved a very agreeable person meanwhile is helpful and trusting while someone at the opposite end may be suspicious or uncooperative and finally on the neuroticism spectrum an emotionally stable person will be more calm and secure while a less stable person is often anxious insecure and self-pitying the important idea here is that these traits are hypothesized to predict behavior and attitude like an introvert might prefer communicating through email

more than an extroverted and agreeable person is much more likely to help their neighbor move that couch then a suspicious one who's just glaring through the window my adulthood trait theorists will tell you these characteristics are pretty stable but isn't to say that they can't flex a little in different situations like that same shy person might end up singing Elvis karaoke in a room full of people under the right conditions so our personality traits are better predicting our average behavior than what we do in any specific situation and research indicates that some traits like neuroticism seem to be better predictors of behavior than others this flexibility that we all seem to have leads to the fourth major theory on personality the

social cognitive perspective originally proposed by our Bovo beading friend alfred bandura the social cognitive school emphasizes the interaction between our traits and their social context ventura noted that we learn a lot of our behavior by watching and imitating others that's the social part of the equation but we also think a lot about how these social interactions affect our behavior which is the cognitive part so in this way people and their situations basically work together to create behavior bandura referred to this sort of interplay as reciprocal determinism meaning that for example the kind of books you read or music you listen to or friends you hang out with say something about your personality because different people choose to be in

different environments and then those environments in turn continue to reinforce our personalities so if Bernice has a kind of anxious suspicious personality and she has a serious Titanic crush on Sherlock Holmes she might be extra attuned to potentially dangerous or fishy situations the more she sees the world in that way the more anxious and suspicious she gets in this way we're both the creators and the products of the situation's we surround ourselves with that's why one of the key indicators of personality in this school of thought has to do with our sense of personal control that is the extent to which you perceive that you have control over your environment someone who believes that they control their own fate or make

their own luck is said to have an internal locus of control while those who feel like they're just guided by forces beyond their control are said to have an external locus now whether we're talking about control versus helplessness introversion versus extraversion calm versus anxious or whatever each of these different personality perspectives have their own methods of testing and measuring personality we talked before about how the psychoanalyst super hunk Hermann Rorschach used his ink blot test to infer information about a person's personality we know that Freud used dream analysis and both he and Young were fans of free association the broader school of theorists now known as the psychodynamic camp that descended from Freud and pals also use other projective psychological

tests including the famous Thematic Apperception tests in this kind of test you'd be presented with evocative but ambiguous pictures and then asked to provide information about them you might be asked to tell a story about the scenes considering things like how are the characters feeling or what's going on or what happened before this event and what will happen after like check it out is the woman crying because her brother just died from a bee sting or is she a maid laughing because some royal just passed out drunk in his bed or perhaps the object of her long burning affection has just confessed his love and a fever hazel jane austen style and she's having a mini breakdown in the hall the idea is that your responses will reveal something about your

concerns and motivations in real life or how you see the world or about your unconscious processes that drive you by contrast with that approach though modern trait personality researchers believe that you can assess personality traits by having people answer a series of test questions there are lots of so called personality trait inventories out there some provide a quick reading on a particular enduring trait like anxiety or self-esteem while others gauge a wide range of traits like our friends the Big Five these tests like the myers-briggs which you might have heard of involve long questionnaires of true false or agree/disagree questions like do you enjoy being the center of attention do you find it easy to empathize with

others or do you value justice over mercy but the classic Minnesota multiphasic personality inventory is probably the most widely used personality test the most recent version asks a series of five in 67 true/false questions varying from no one seems to understand me too I like mechanics magazines too I loved my father and is often used to identify emotional disorders and there's how bandura's social cognitive camp sizes you up because this school of thought emphasizes the interaction of environment and behavior rather than just traits alone they aren't solely into questions and answers instead they might measure personality in different contexts understanding behavior in one situation is best predicted by how you acted in a similar situation like if Bernice

freaked out and tried to hide under the bed during the last five thunderstorms we can predict the chip will do that again next time and if we conducted a controlled lab experiment where say we looked at the effects of thunderstorm noises on people's behavior we might get an even better sense of what baseline psychological factors could best predict storm induced freak-outs and finally there are the humanistic theorists like Maslow they often reject standardized assessments altogether instead they tend to measure your self-concept through therapy interviews and questionnaires that asked subjects to describe both how they would ideally like to be and how they actually are the idea is that the closer the actual and ideal are the more positive the subjects sense of self

which brings us back to that biggest motherlode question of them all who or what is the self all the books out there about self esteem self-help self awareness self control and so on are built upon one assumption that the self is the organizer of our thoughts and feelings and actions essentially the center of a personality but of course it's a sticky issue one way to think about self is through the concept of possible selves like your ideal self perhaps devastatingly attractive and intelligent successful and well loved as well as your most feared self the one who could end up unemployed and lonely and run down this balance of potential best and worst selves motivates us through life. In the end, once you factor in environment and childhood experiences,

culture, and all that mess, not to mention biology, which we haven't even touched on today, can we really firmly define self or answer certainly that we even have one? That, my friend, is one of life's biggest questions, insofar as it has yet to be universally answered. But you learned a lot, anyway, today, right? As we've talked about the trait and social cognitive perspectives and also about different ways these schools and others measure and test personality we also talked about what self is and how our self-esteem works thanks for watching especially to our subbable subscribers who make crash course possible to find out how you can become a supporter just go to subbable.com/crashcourse this episode was written by Kathleen Yale edited by Blake de pastino and our consultant is

- [02:17] stable and lasting behavior patterns and conscious motivations legend has it that
- [02:21] it all began in 1919 when young American psychologist Gordon Allport paid a visit
- [02:26] to none other than Freud himself Allport was telling Freud about his
- [02:30] journey there on the train and how there was this little boy who was obsessed
- [02:34] with staying clean and didn't want to sit next to anyone or touch anything
- [02:37] Albert wondered if the boy's mother had a kind of dirt phobia that had rubbed
- [02:42] off on him so yeah yeah yeah he's telling his tale and at the end of it
- [02:45] Freud looks at him and says hmm was that little boy you all port was basically
- [02:50] like no man that was just some kid on the train don't try to make this into
- [02:54] some big unconscious episode from my repressed childhood
- [02:57] Allport thought Freud was digging a little too deep and that sometimes you
- [03:00] just need to look at motives in the present not the past to describe
- [03:04] behavior so all-ports started his own Club describing personality in terms of
- [03:08] fundamental traits or characteristics and conscious motives it wasn't so much
- [03:13] interested in explaining traits as he was in describing them modern trait
- [03:16] researchers like Robert McRae and Paul Costa have since organized our
- [03:19] fundamental characteristics into what's casually known as the big five openness
- [03:24] conscientiousness extraversion agreeableness and neuroticism which you
- [03:28] can remember using the mnemonic ocean or canoe whichever one you prefer
- [03:33] each of these traits exists on a spectrum so for example your level of
- [03:36] openness can range on one end from being totally open to new things in variety or
- [03:41] one thing strict regular routine on the other end your degree of
- [03:44] conscientiousness can translate into being impulsive and care
- [03:47] lists are careful and disciplined someone high on the extraversion in will
- [03:51] be sociable while those on the low end will be shy and reserved a very
- [03:55] agreeable person meanwhile is helpful and trusting while someone at the
- [03:58] opposite end may be suspicious or uncooperative and finally on the
- [04:01] neuroticism spectrum an emotionally stable person will be more calm and
- [04:05] secure while a less stable person is often anxious insecure and self-pitying
- [04:10] the important idea here is that these traits are hypothesized to predict
- [04:13] behavior and attitude like an introvert might prefer communicating through email
- [04:17] more than an extroverted and agreeable person is much more likely to help their
- [04:20] neighbor move that couch then a suspicious one who's just glaring
- [04:22] through the window my adulthood trait theorists will tell you these
- [04:25] characteristics are pretty stable but isn't to say that they can't flex a
- [04:29] little in different situations like that same shy person might end up singing
- [04:33] Elvis karaoke in a room full of people under the right conditions so our
- [04:36] personality traits are better predicting our average behavior than what we do in
- [04:40] any specific situation and research indicates that some traits like
- [04:43] neuroticism seem to be better predictors of behavior than others this flexibility
- [04:47] that we all seem to have leads to the fourth major theory on personality the
- [04:51] social cognitive perspective originally proposed by our Bovo beading friend
- [04:55] alfred bandura the social cognitive school emphasizes the interaction
- [04:59] between our traits and their social context ventura noted that we learn a
- [05:03] lot of our behavior by watching and imitating others that's the social part
- [05:06] of the equation but we also think a lot about how these social interactions
- [05:10] affect our behavior which is the cognitive part so in this way people and
- [05:14] their situations basically work together to create behavior bandura referred to
- [05:18] this sort of interplay as reciprocal determinism meaning that for example the
- [05:23] kind of books you read or music you listen to or friends you hang out with
- [05:26] say something about your personality because different people choose to be in
- [05:30] different environments and then those environments in turn continue to
- [05:34] reinforce our personalities so if Bernice has a kind of anxious suspicious
- [05:38] personality and she has a serious Titanic crush on Sherlock Holmes she
- [05:41] might be extra attuned to potentially dangerous or fishy situations the more
- [05:46] she sees the world in that way the more anxious and suspicious she gets in this
- [05:49] way we're both the creators and the products of the situation's we surround
- [05:54] ourselves with that's why one of the key indicators of personality in this school
- [05:58] of thought has to do with our sense of personal
- [06:00] control that is the extent to which you perceive that you have control over your
- [06:04] environment someone who believes that they control their own fate or make
- [06:07] their own luck is said to have an internal locus of control while those
- [06:11] who feel like they're just guided by forces beyond their control are said to
- [06:14] have an external locus now whether we're talking about control versus
- [06:18] helplessness introversion versus extraversion calm versus anxious or
- [06:22] whatever each of these different personality perspectives have their own
- [06:26] methods of testing and measuring personality we talked before about how
- [06:30] the psychoanalyst super hunk Hermann Rorschach used his ink blot test to
- [06:33] infer information about a person's personality
- [06:36] we know that Freud used dream analysis and both he and Young were fans of free
- [06:40] association the broader school of theorists now known as the psychodynamic
- [06:43] camp that descended from Freud and pals also use other projective psychological
- [06:47] tests including the famous Thematic Apperception tests in this kind of test
- [06:52] you'd be presented with evocative but ambiguous pictures and then asked to
- [06:56] provide information about them you might be asked to tell a story about the
- [07:00] scenes considering things like how are the characters feeling or what's going
- [07:03] on or what happened before this event and what will happen after like check it
- [07:07] out is the woman crying because her brother just died from a bee sting or is
- [07:10] she a maid laughing because some royal just passed out drunk in his bed or
- [07:14] perhaps the object of her long burning affection has just confessed his love
- [07:18] and a fever hazel jane austen style and she's having a mini breakdown in the
- [07:22] hall the idea is that your responses will reveal something about your
- [07:25] concerns and motivations in real life or how you see the world or about your
- [07:29] unconscious processes that drive you by contrast with that approach though
- [07:33] modern trait personality researchers believe that you can assess personality
- [07:36] traits by having people answer a series of test questions there are lots of so
- [07:40] called personality trait inventories out there some provide a quick reading on a
- [07:44] particular enduring trait like anxiety or self-esteem
- [07:47] while others gauge a wide range of traits like our friends the Big Five
- [07:51] these tests like the myers-briggs which you might have heard of involve long
- [07:54] questionnaires of true false or agree/disagree questions like do you
- [07:58] enjoy being the center of attention do you find it easy to empathize with
- [08:02] others or do you value justice over mercy but the classic Minnesota
- [08:06] multiphasic personality inventory is probably the most widely used
- [08:10] personality test the most recent version asks a series of five
- [08:14] in 67 true/false questions varying from no one seems to understand me too I like
- [08:19] mechanics magazines too I loved my father and is often used to identify
- [08:23] emotional disorders and there's how bandura's social cognitive camp sizes
- [08:27] you up because this school of thought emphasizes the interaction of
- [08:30] environment and behavior rather than just traits alone
- [08:33] they aren't solely into questions and answers instead they might measure
- [08:36] personality in different contexts understanding behavior in one situation
- [08:40] is best predicted by how you acted in a similar situation like if Bernice
- [08:44] freaked out and tried to hide under the bed during the last five thunderstorms
- [08:48] we can predict the chip will do that again next time and if we conducted a
- [08:51] controlled lab experiment where say we looked at the effects of thunderstorm
- [08:54] noises on people's behavior we might get an even better sense of what baseline
- [08:58] psychological factors could best predict storm induced freak-outs and finally
- [09:02] there are the humanistic theorists like Maslow they often reject standardized
- [09:06] assessments altogether instead they tend to measure your self-concept through
- [09:10] therapy interviews and questionnaires that asked subjects to describe both how
- [09:14] they would ideally like to be and how they actually are the idea is that the
- [09:18] closer the actual and ideal are the more positive the subjects sense of self
- [09:22] which brings us back to that biggest motherlode question of them all who or
- [09:26] what is the self all the books out there about self esteem self-help self
- [09:31] awareness self control and so on are built upon one assumption that the self
- [09:35] is the organizer of our thoughts and feelings and actions essentially the
- [09:39] center of a personality but of course it's a sticky issue one way to think
- [09:43] about self is through the concept of possible selves like your ideal self
- [09:47] perhaps devastatingly attractive and intelligent successful and well loved as
- [09:51] well as your most feared self the one who could end up unemployed and lonely
- [09:54] and run down this balance of potential best and worst selves motivates us
- [09:58] through life. In the end, once you factor in environment and childhood experiences,
- [10:02] culture, and all that mess, not to mention biology, which we haven't even touched on
- [10:06] today, can we really firmly define self or
- [10:09] answer certainly that we even have one? That, my friend, is one of life's biggest
- [10:13] questions, insofar as it has yet to be universally answered. But you learned a lot,
- [10:18] anyway, today, right? As we've talked about the trait and social cognitive
- [10:21] perspectives and also about different ways these schools and others measure
- [10:25] and test personality we also talked about

### Transcript (reading)

People have been having sex and writing songs about it and carving statues of it and changing fashion for it since the dawn of humanity, but it wasn't until fairly recently in the 1940s that serious Western scientific study of sex began. And by most accounts you can thank one guy for that: Alfred Kinsey. Kinsey was born in 1894 in New Jersey, to poor strict Methodist parents. He studied etymology in college, graduated with degrees in biology and psychology before heading to Harvard. His doctoral thesis was on the genealogy of Gall wasps, a subject he tackled with intensity; meticulously collecting over five million samples, measuring hundreds of thousands of specimens. And wasps are interesting and everything, but Kinsey's interests drifted toward human

sexuality and his research in Indiana University paved the way for decades of study into sex. He surveyed thousands of men and women about their sexual habits and histories, and found all sorts of interesting things related to sexual preferences, masturbation, orgasms, and pre-marital sex. He established the "Kinsey scale" indicating degrees of sexual orientation) and went on to write the seminal texts on sexual behavior in the human male and female respectively. Like many researchers of human behavior, Kinsey and his colleagues were - and in some ways still are - pretty controversial. But he definitely succeeded in two very important tasks. One: he was an early adopter of a scientific approach to studying sex, and two: he showed

that the popular perception of what people do and don't do sexually, versus what people actually do and feel, was often very different. Since then we've seen innumerable sex-related studies examining the physiological and psychological and social elements of sex. And, there's a whole lot of lingering misinformation and judging morality swirling around the subject of sex. It can be a tricky topic for sure but we are here to clear some things up. It's the entire purpose of life so there's no reason to blush. So. Sex. That one little word has complicated so many lives. The desire for or lack of sex has spawned poetry and made babies and transmitted diseases and cost money and driven people batty and kept late-night cable in business.

Even the word itself can mean many different things. First we've got the verb kind of sex, the physical process of engaging in sexual acts and intercourse, which, probably I don't need to describe to you. Then we've got the biological definition, having to do with the anatomical parts that go with the designations of male or female or intersex - those who were born with the reproductive parts that don't fall into the predominant definitions of male or female. And these are quite separate from gender, or an individual's sense of identifying as male or female or another gender identity regardless of how that corresponds with their actual reproductive plumbing. For transgender people, for instance, gender identity typically doesn't match biological sex.

And remember that gender identity is completely different from sexual orientation, which we'll talk about in a minute. So beyond definitions, we have the physiological and psychological aspects of sex. Let's start with the physiological, and with that, Masters and Johnson. In the late 1950's and 60's, American gynecologists Williams Masters, and his collaborator and future wife, sexologist Virginia Johnson, did something no researchers had ever done before. They invited nearly 700 male and female volunteers, many of them sex workers, to come into their lab and get it on, either alone or with their partners. Their aim? To record the body's physiological response to sex. This involved wearing a whole lot of wires and heart monitors and such, and is probably about as sexy as it sounds.

All the volunteers had to be willing and able to show arousal and be capable of orgasm. And over the years, Masters and Johnson recorded more than ten thousand "sexual cycles". The main thing they documented was that a complete sexual response cycle involved four distinct stages - excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution - which Masters and Johnson maintained happened in a linear way, one after the other. In the excitement phase, things are gettin' goin', blood is rushing to all the necessary places, genital areas are becoming engorged and secreting lubricant. Next comes the plateau phase. Pulse, blood pressure, and breathing rates keep increasing and genitals are becoming fully engorged.

The penis is often secreting pre-ejaculate as vaginal secretions increase until the big event orgasm during which muscles all over the body contract and breathing and pulse rates hit their peak. Of course, a biological male orgasm typically releases sperm that may lead to fertilization, depending on the situation, but female arousal and orgasm also help facilitate conception, again depending on the situation as those muscle contractions and lubrication help draw up and retain sperm in the uterus. Finally, the body comes back down to its normal state of affairs during the resolution phase. It's during this phase that biosex males enter a refractory period during which they're unable to orgasm again for a few minutes to a day or more whereas biological females refractory

period is very short in comparison. While the four stage model of sexual response is still taught today, some have criticized both its rigid linear setup, arguing that things don't always work so tidily in the bedroom, and it's insistence in including orgasm which doesn't happen for everyone all the time. Others also question the model's clinical focus on only physiological factors arguing the cultural attitudes, psychological and relationship factors, and other external details should also be considered when looking at sexual response. I'll get back to that in a minute, but before we move on to the psychology of sex, we got to talk about hormones. You remember hormones, those chemical messengers brewed up by the endocrine system that travel

through the bloodstream and regulate all sorts of physiological and behavioral activities from growth to digestion to sleep to sex. Our sex hormones serve two major purposes. One, they direct the physical development of biological sex characteristics, and two, they help activate sexual behavior. Estrogens like estradiol contribute to female sex characteristics and are secreted in greater amounts by females than males and while all humans make testosterone, it's the predominate sex hormone for males, stimulating the growth and development of male sex characteristics. Now most female mammals become sexually receptive when their estrogens peak during ovulation, but it doesn't really work that way for humans.

Our hormones are more loosely related to sexual behavior, although studies have found that in general female's sexual desire spikes slightly around ovulation, when woman are most fertile and males can also be affected by this spike, responding with higher levels of testosterone when ovulating women are around. But these short term changes hardly compare to the larger more major hormonal shifts that occur throughout a life time. Puberty, for one, tends to get everyone a lot more hot and bothered and interested in dating and gazing at posters of their favorite celebrity crushes and later in life, as sex hormone production normally decreases, our amorous urges and endeavors tend to decrease as well.

Age affects our libido. But in the end you might think of sex hormones as fuel for your sexual engine, and while an engine can't run on a totally empty tank, it also won't run any better or worse on a full tank versus a half tank. We need our sex hormones, but we also need the right psychological stimuli to turn us on and keep us going sexually. So, finally, let's look at some of these psychological aspects of sex. First, there are the very important social and cultural influences. Things like your families, your societies, your religions, and your personal values. Does your community view sex merely as the means for reproduction or can it be fun too? What are the views on premarital sex, and homosexuality, showing some skin or kissing in public?

Then there are the influences of external stimuli. In western society, we're constantly bombarded with sexually charged content from movies and TV to advertisements, R&B slow jams, and Victoria Secret catalogs. And constantly looking at images of things that you find extremely attractive can lead to folks viewing more average people, even their own partners, as being less attractive. But our sexual desire is also fueled by internal stimuli. Our imagination and memories and fantasies. According to plenty of studies, at least 95% of people fantasize about sex at some point. The thing you need to keep in mind is that none of these factors work independently of each other. How we respond to both external and internal stimuli can be really heavily influenced by

social and cultural factors, and that is where a lot of the thinking and studying of sex has gotten really complicated. Human judgment and morality is often entangled with sex and desire and sadly, a lot of people have been made to feel miserable for liking certain things or being attracted to certain people. There's also just been a lot of misinformation out there. For ages, a lot of folks believed that masturbation could make you go blind, become mentally ill, or kill the neighborhood kittens. It doesn't do that. And as I know, you're thinking right now one area of sexuality has been needlessly associated with conflict, fear, and shame in many cultures is sexual orientation.

For our purposes, sexual orientation can be defined as a relatively enduring physical or romantic attraction to another person. Heterosexual, homosexual, and bisexual are all types of sexual orientation. And although the field once stigmatized non-heterosexual orientations, we now know that homosexuality and bisexuality are in no way related to mental health. Psychologists are also beginning to look more in depth at other sexual orientations. For instance, Asexuality or nonsexuality, where no sexual attraction of any kind is experienced. In any case, whether a culture itself is friendly to or tyrannical against any of these orientations, all types prevail. Sexual orientation is neither chosen nor changed.

So, what might cause these differences? Hopefully you already know this but it's worth repeating. There's no evidence that sexual orientation is determined by things like dominating mother or passive father or sex hormone levels in your adult body or your history of childhood abuse or whether your parents were gay or straight. In other words, decades of research have led most researchers to believed that once you're born, there are no clear environmental factors that influence your sexual orientation. And there's been a lot of research into possible biological components of sexual orientation, like genetics, brain anatomy, prenatal conditions, or other things. It's also important to know that we're far from understanding sexual orientation on a purely biological level.

If anything, the evidence we've got simply strengthens the idea that sexual orientation isn't choice, but rather a naturally varying occurrence among human beings, like height. So. After all this talk about sex, perhaps you're wondering why we do it at all. I mean, it feels good obviously. But the biggest function of sex goes beyond pure pleasure. In fact, sexual intimacy serves many of life's most basic purposes: some times procreation, but also stress reduction, maintaining healthy relationships, social bonding, and the expression of love, and overall fulfillment. People say he brain is the most significant sex organ for a reason. And intimacy is often its own reward. Today, you learned about Alfred Kinsey's ground breaking sex surveys, the differences between

how we define biological sex and gender identity, and about Masters and Johnson's four-part sexual response cycle. We also looked at the role of sex hormones, in our development and drive, how psychological and social factors play into sex, how we think about sexual orientation and why we have sex in the first place.

- [05:43] Our sex hormones serve two major purposes.
- [05:45] One, they direct the physical development of biological sex characteristics, and two,
- [05:50] they help activate sexual behavior.
- [05:53] Estrogens like estradiol contribute to female sex characteristics and are secreted in greater
- [05:57] amounts by females than males and while all humans make testosterone, it's the predominate
- [06:01] sex hormone for males, stimulating the growth and development of male sex characteristics.
- [06:06] Now most female mammals become sexually receptive when their estrogens peak during ovulation,
- [06:11] but it doesn't really work that way for humans.
- [06:14] Our hormones are more loosely related to sexual behavior, although studies have found that
- [06:18] in general female's sexual desire spikes slightly around ovulation, when woman are most fertile
- [06:23] and males can also be affected by this spike, responding with higher levels of testosterone
- [06:28] when ovulating women are around.
- [06:30] But these short term changes hardly compare to the larger more major hormonal shifts that
- [06:35] occur throughout a life time.
- [06:37] Puberty, for one, tends to get everyone a lot more hot and bothered and interested in
- [06:41] dating and gazing at posters of their favorite celebrity crushes and later in life, as sex
- [06:46] hormone production normally decreases, our amorous urges and endeavors tend to decrease
- [06:51] as well.
- [06:52] Age affects our libido.
- [06:53] But in the end you might think of sex hormones as fuel for your sexual engine, and while
- [06:58] an engine can't run on a totally empty tank, it also won't run any better or worse on a
- [07:03] full tank versus a half tank.
- [07:05] We need our sex hormones, but we also need the right psychological stimuli to turn us
- [07:10] on and keep us going sexually.
- [07:13] So, finally, let's look at some of these psychological aspects of sex.
- [07:17] First, there are the very important social and cultural influences.
- [07:21] Things like your families, your societies, your religions, and your personal values.
- [07:25] Does your community view sex merely as the means for reproduction or can it be fun too?
- [07:30] What are the views on premarital sex, and homosexuality, showing some skin or kissing
- [07:34] in public?
- [07:35] Then there are the influences of external stimuli.
- [07:37] In western society, we're constantly bombarded with sexually charged content from movies
- [07:42] and TV to advertisements, R&B slow jams, and Victoria Secret catalogs.
- [07:47] And constantly looking at images of things that you find extremely attractive can lead
- [07:51] to folks viewing more average people, even their own partners, as being less attractive.
- [07:56] But our sexual desire is also fueled by internal stimuli.
- [07:59] Our imagination and memories and fantasies.
- [08:02] According to plenty of studies, at least 95% of people fantasize about sex at some point.
- [08:06] The thing you need to keep in mind is that none of these factors work independently of
- [08:09] each other.
- [08:10] How we respond to both external and internal stimuli can be really heavily influenced by
- [08:15] social and cultural factors, and that is where a lot of the thinking and studying of sex
- [08:21] has gotten really complicated.
- [08:23] Human judgment and morality is often entangled with sex and desire and sadly, a lot of people
- [08:28] have been made to feel miserable for liking certain things or being attracted to certain
- [08:32] people.
- [08:33] There's also just been a lot of misinformation out there.
- [08:35] For ages, a lot of folks believed that masturbation could make you go blind, become mentally ill,
- [08:40] or kill the neighborhood kittens.
- [08:42] It doesn't do that.
- [08:44] And as I know, you're thinking right now one area of sexuality has been needlessly associated
- [08:48] with conflict, fear, and shame in many cultures is sexual orientation.
- [08:53] For our purposes, sexual orientation can be defined as a relatively enduring physical
- [08:56] or romantic attraction to another person.
- [08:58] Heterosexual, homosexual, and bisexual are all types of sexual orientation.
- [09:02] And although the field once stigmatized non-heterosexual orientations, we now know that homosexuality
- [09:07] and bisexuality are in no way related to mental health.
- [09:11] Psychologists are also beginning to look more in depth at other sexual orientations.
- [09:14] For instance, Asexuality or nonsexuality, where no sexual attraction of any kind is
- [09:20] experienced.
- [09:21] In any case, whether a culture itself is friendly to or tyrannical against any of these orientations,
- [09:26] all types prevail.
- [09:27] Sexual orientation is neither chosen nor changed.
- [09:31] So, what might cause these differences?
- [09:33] Hopefully you already know this but it's worth repeating.
- [09:35] There's no evidence that sexual orientation is determined by things like dominating mother
- [09:39] or passive father or sex hormone levels in your adult body or your history of childhood
- [09:44] abuse or whether your parents were gay or straight.
- [09:46] In other words, decades of research have led most researchers to believed that once you're
- [09:50] born, there are no clear environmental factors that influence your sexual orientation.
- [09:55] And there's been a lot of research into possible biological components of sexual orientation,
- [09:59] like genetics, brain anatomy, prenatal conditions, or other things.
- [10:04] It's also important to know that we're far from understanding sexual orientation on a
- [10:08] purely biological level.
- [10:09] If anything, the evidence we've got simply strengthens the idea that sexual orientation
- [10:13] isn't choice, but rather a naturally varying occurrence among human beings, like height.
- [10:17] So.
- [10:18] After all this talk about sex, perhaps you're wondering why we do it at all.
- [10:22] I mean, it feels good obviously.
- [10:23] But the biggest function of sex goes beyond pure pleasure.
- [10:26] In fact, sexual intimacy serves many of life's most basic purposes: some times procreation,
- [10:31] but also stress reduction, maintaining healthy relationships, social bonding, and the expression
- [10:36] of love, and overall fulfillment.
- [10:38] People say he brain is the most significant sex organ for a reason.
- [10:41] And intimacy is often its own reward.
- [10:43] Today, you learned about Alfred Kinsey's ground breaking sex surveys, the differences between
- [10:48] how we define biological sex and gender identity, and about Masters and Johnson's four-part
- [10:53] sexual response cycle.
- [10:54] We also looked at the role of sex hormones, in our development and drive, how psychological
- [10:59] and social factors play into sex, how we think about sexual orientation and why we have sex
- [11:05] in the first place.

### Transcript (reading)

In February 1999, four New York City police officers were on patrol in the Bronx when they saw a young black man standing on a stoop. They thought he looked suspicious. When they pulled over, he retreated into the doorway and began digging in his pocket. He kept digging as the police shouted at him to show his hands; a few seconds later, the man, Amadou Diallo, a 23-year-old immigrant from Guinea, was dead, hit by 19 of the 41 bullets that the police fired at him. What Diallo was reaching for was his wallet. He was going for his ID as he stood on the steps of his own apartment building. Diallo's story, and the officer's fatal pre-judgment of him, is recounted in Malcolm Gladwell's 2005 bestseller Blink. Gladwell, and the social psychologists whose

work he draws upon, explores Diallo's case as an example of that grey area between deliberate violence and an accident, propagated by non-conscious, or implicit biases. The officers did discriminate against Diallo, but the prejudice they acted on may have been driven by something more subtle than simple hatred. And that's an important thing to think about. Yes, there are lots of overtly bigoted people and policies at work all over the world, but what we're interested in today is the more insidious, non-conscious automatic bias, and how it can affect our behavior. The fact is, our implicit biases affect the way we relate to others in a very real way. Our race, gender, age, religion, or sexual orientation can make the difference between

whether we get a job or not, a fair paycheck, or a good rental, or whether we get randomly pulled over or shot and killed for reaching for a wallet. In the last two episodes, we've examined how we think about and how we influence one another, but social psychology is also about how we relate to one another. Like what factors might cause us to help another person, or harm them, or fear them? What are the social, and cognitive, and emotional roots of prejudice, racism, and sexism, and how do they shape our society? These are some of the aspects of ourselves that are the hardest and most uncomfortable for us to explore, which is why they're so important to understand. We've all been unfairly judged in our time, and let's not pretend that we haven't done

our fair share of uninformed judging too. Like it or not, prejudice is a common human condition. Prejudice just means "prejudgment." It's an unjustified, typically negative attitude toward an individual or group. Prejudicial attitudes are often directed along the lines of gender, ethnic, socioeconomic status, or culture, and by definition, prejudice is not the same thing as stereotyping or discrimination, although the three phenomena are intimately related. People may distrust a female mechanic. That's a prejudicial attitude, but it's rooted in a stereotype, or over-generalized belief about a particular group. Although it's often discussed in a negative way, stereotyping is really more of a general cognitive process that doesn't have to be negative. It can even be accurate at times.

Like, I have the stereotype that all crows have wings, injuries and birth defects aside. And that happens to be true. But on the negative end, your prejudice against female mechanics may be rooted in some inaccurate stereotype about women's skills with a socket wrench. And when stereotypical beliefs combine with prejudicial attitudes and emotions, like fear and hostility, they can drive the behavior we call discrimination. So a prejudiced person won't necessarily act on their attitude. Say you believe in the stereotype that overweight people are lazy. You might then feel a prejudiced distaste when you see someone who appears overweight. But if you act on your prejudice, and, say, refuse to hire them for a job or don't let

them sit at your lunch counter, then you've crossed over into discriminating against them. The former apartheid system of racial segregation in South Africa, the Nazis' mass killing of Gypsies, Jewish people, and other groups, and centuries of bloodshed between Protestants and Catholics, are all extreme examples of violent prejudice and discrimination. The good news is that in many cultures, certain forms of overt prejudice have waned over time. For example, in 1937 only 1/3 of Americans said that they'd vote for a qualified woman to be president, while in 2007, that figure was up to nearly 90 percent. But of course more subtle prejudices can still linger. In the past, we've talked about dual-process theories of thought, memories, and attitudes,

and that while we're aware of our explicit thoughts, or implicit cognition still operates under the radar, leaving us clueless about its effect on our attitudes and behavior. In the same way, prejudice can be non-conscious and automatic. And I mean it can be so non-conscious that even when people ask us point-blank about our attitudes, we unwillingly or unknowingly don't always give them an honest answer. Do you think that men are better at science the women? Or that Muslims are more violent than Christians? Or that overweight people are unhealthy? Our tendency to unwittingly doctor our answers to questions like these is why we have the implicit association test, or IAT. The test was implemented in the late 1990s to try to

gauge implicit attitudes, identities, beliefs, and biases that people are unwilling or unable to report. You can take the IAT online and measure your implicit attitudes in all kinds of topics, from race, religion, and gender to disability, weight, and sexuality. It's basically a timed categorization task. For example, the age-related IAT looks at implicit attitudes about older vs. younger people. In it, you might be shown a series of faces, old and young, and objects, pleasant and unpleasant, like pretty flowers vs. a pile of garbage. You're then asked to sort these pictures, so you'd press the left key if you see a young face or a pleasant object, and press the right key if you see an old face or an unpleasant

object. That's the stereotypic condition. Your keystrokes correspond to stereotypical pairs; in this case, associating good stuff with youth and bad stuff with older age. Then the test asks you to do the same thing in a counter-stereotypic condition, pressing the left key if you see a young face or an unpleasant object and the right key if you see an old face or a pleasant object. The core of the test is your reaction time. Are you faster at sorting when you're working with a stereotypical pairing than you are with counter-stereotypical pairings? If that's the case, even though you may think you're unprejudiced, you've got an implicit association between youth and goodness, which, as you might guess, may have some implications about how you think and act toward older people.

The test is widely used in research, and contrary to what some critics think, it's surprisingly predictive of discriminatory behavior in all kinds of experimental settings. So that's one way to measure subtle, implicit prejudice. But obviously, overt prejudice is far from dead. That's why discrimination studies are prominent in social psychology research, and they can also predict, sometimes with scary accuracy, how discrimination might show up in broad social patterns, like wage inequality and job opportunity gaps. For instance, the 2012 Yale study led by social scientist Corinne Moss-Racusin demonstrated that science faculty across the country systematically discriminated against female science students.

In a double-blind study, a representative sample of science faculty members were asked to hire a fictional student applicant for a lab-manager job. When the applicant's name was Jennifer, instead of John, they viewed her as less competent, were less likely to hire her, offered her less money, and were less likely to mentor her. And this prejudice was even exhibited by women faculty members. And that's an important point. People on both sides of the stereotype tend to respond similarly, with the subjects of prejudice themselves often holding the same stereotypical implicit attitudes or engaging in the same discriminatory behavior. So when we say that stereotypes are pervasive, we mean pervasive.

Now it's all too easy to hold up examples of how people are prejudiced, but the real root of the issue is why they are. Here are a few possibilities: For one, prejudices can come up as a way of justifying social inequalities. This happens when people on both sides of the power and wealth spectrum start believing that people get what they deserve, and they deserve what they get. This is called the just-world phenomenon. Prejudices can also be driven by the "us vs. them," or as social psychologists often call it, the ingroup-outgroup phenomenon. Whether you're in a soccer stadium, or the political arena or school lunchroom, or, you know, in the comments of this video, dividing the world into in-groups and out-groups definitely drives prejudice and discrimination.

But an in-group identity also gives its members the benefits of communal solidarity and a sort of safety in numbers. This in-group bias, or tendency to favor your own group at the expense of others, is powerful, even when it's totally irrational. One common social psychology exercise on in-group favoritism involves dividing a class into two arbitrary groups, say, those wearing sneakers and those not wearing sneakers. Each person sits with his or her group and is told to list differences between themselves and the opposing group. The lists usually start out pretty tame, but become more strident as they grow longer. Eventually, you have sneaker-wearing kids saying that they're just smarter than the people without

sneakers. The kids who don't have sneakers say that the other kids are trashy and low-class. Soon enough, each group has inflated itself and derided the opposing group, even though the division between the two was essentially meaningless to begin with. Little exercises like this illustrate the power of any ingroup-outgroup distinction in creating conflict between groups, and that brings us to the psychological nature of conflict itself. History is littered with examples of how the us vs. them mentality has fueled violence in warfare, which is exactly what we'll be talking about next time. Today, you learned about how prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination affect how we interact and relate to one another. You learned how prejudice can often be non-conscious and automatic

and how tools like the Implicit Association Test help reveal and measure it. We also looked at the implications of the ingroup-outgroup phenomenon, and how it can lead to strong in-group bias that often turns aggressive.
