00:00:00.640 Hello everybody. Hello. We're back. I know that um a few of you
00:00:07.200 uh the hashtag freej is going around a little bit. You okay? He's here. He's
00:00:12.320 okay. Yeah, you you had to unlock the cage in the garage to let me out. So, I'm I'm here. Yeah. I I thank you for giving me
00:00:20.080 some breakfast this morning, too, after letting me out of the cage. Don't worry. You don't have to free me. I'm good. Yeah. Yeah, we're here. Um, and we have
00:00:29.279 a lot to talk about. Remember when I said that uh last live and it went nine hours? I don't think this one will be
00:00:36.719 nine hours. It's going to probably be a few hours though. I don't know. It's going to be long. We've got a lot to say. Grab your be grab your beverages. Grab
00:00:44.640 your popcorn. Grab something. Right. Whatever it is, you grab your tea. I actually have some coffee this
00:00:50.800 morning. I've got a bit of everything here um laid out. So, we've got a lot to talk about. Um, yeah, which I'm sure all of
00:00:58.960 you know. And when I say we, John actually is going to have the most to
00:01:05.119 talk about. Yeah. Uh, because I actually, you know, went live for nine hours as many of you have
00:01:10.640 pointed it out, right? So, nine hours and 9 minutes. Um, yeah.
00:01:15.840 So, you're going to give me the floor. I'm gonna give you the floor. You're gonna give me the floor today. And
00:01:22.240 I want to I want to talk about what happened, but I want to do it more philosophically and
00:01:29.360 more psychologically. So, we're we're going to get into things like the psychology of stalking. We're going to
00:01:34.720 get into the nature of this conflict, the nature
00:01:40.320 of why people with the different conversations people are having since you released your live, whether you're
00:01:46.320 lying, whether you know whether
00:01:51.520 um you're telling the truth, right? Like uh whether
00:01:57.119 you were stalked, is that is that just free speech? Right? We're going to cover all of that and we're going to cover
00:02:02.240 that from mainly a psychological perspective because I am a psychologist.
00:02:07.439 But since you have your PhD in psychology,
00:02:13.840 right? Not philosophy. Just to clarify, a PhD is by definition a doctor of
00:02:20.319 philosophy. Don't worry, I covered that in my live. So, yeah. So, correct. I am a licensed
00:02:25.680 psychologist. I am a clinical and forensic psychologist. And so we're going to approach this largely from a
00:02:31.280 psychological perspective. And before we begin, I do want to say thank you to everyone for that your
00:02:38.640 support. We've actually received thousands of emails and messages from people uh
00:02:45.920 giving us support and we just want to say thank you too before we begin or I Yeah.
00:02:51.519 And just so kind so so much kindness, so much love. Thank you very much. We
00:02:57.360 we we're able to get through this a lot easier because of the support from our
00:03:03.360 community and our gems. And you guys are amazing and we can't thank you enough. So, yeah. All right. Take it away.
00:03:10.319 So, yeah. So, let's dive into this analysis. I'm going to start in a fairly peculiar
00:03:17.599 unexpected place. Okay. And I'm going to start with talking about Brad Pitt, the actor.
00:03:23.760 That is peculiar. That is it is a little peculiar. Right.
00:03:29.519 So the reason I want to talk about Brad Pitt is because he's an actor in my generation. He's an actor I followed
00:03:35.760 very closely over the years. He's an actor I've really appreciated and
00:03:42.000 I've really kind of watched him mature and develop and grow and and and that's been somewhat inspirational to me. So
00:03:48.959 you do like him. He talks about Brad Pitt. So, let me just say, so I'm going to do a little bit of my own fangirling
00:03:54.560 here, I guess. But let me say that the the reason I got to know Brad Pitt was because in 1992, he was in a movie
00:04:01.599 called A River Runs Through It. A River Runs Through It is one of my favorite movies. It's one of my favorite
00:04:06.640 books. It's a book by Norman Mlan, who was a professor of English literature at the University of Chicago for many
00:04:12.400 years. He wrote this nolla about his childhood growing up in Montana and how fly
00:04:18.798 fishing basically saved his life. It's a brilliant book. It's a brilliant movie.
00:04:23.919 Brad Pitt was in the movie. He actually played the somewhat delinquent brother.
00:04:29.199 It was an interesting role um that you know that that Brad Pitt would kind of reprise many times in his career but he
00:04:36.240 was very good and yeah he was I didn't know who he was at that time
00:04:42.560 and so I was interested I'm like who is this guy right when I watch a movie and there's actors I don't know I'm always interested to kind of figure out who
00:04:48.800 they are where they came from so I I found that Brad Pitt actually was born
00:04:55.199 and raised in a small town in Oklahoma. He was born in in Shaunie, Oklahoma.
00:05:03.759 And I also learned that that at least some of his early career, he began in
00:05:09.199 1987. I didn't know any of his earlier movies. He did a few movies and then he did work for a soap opera. So the
00:05:19.360 evolution of his career really begins with soap operas. And you know, when I learned that I thought, "Oh, this is
00:05:24.960 interesting." Right? Like you don't see a lot of soap opera actors go on to become mega stars.
00:05:30.960 True. I mean I guess some of them have but I don't I'm not aware of a lot. Right. And
00:05:36.000 so so you've got this guy in this major
00:05:42.479 movie. It's produced by Robert Redford. Robert Redford, by the way, in 1992 clearly saw talent in this young actor
00:05:50.080 because Robert Redford has produced some extraordinary movies over the years. He's been in
00:05:55.680 extraordinary movies. He knows the industry. He knows talent. And he picked out Brad Pitt.
00:06:01.600 So shortly after that, Brad Pitt in 1995 was in a movie called
00:06:08.160 Seven and he was one of the detectives and great job. So now my my appreciation of
00:06:16.000 this guy is only increasing. In 1996, he did a movie called 12 Monkeys. Many
00:06:21.199 people probably don't know this movie, but I do because it has to do with mental health and it's it's a it's it it
00:06:28.160 gets into everything I love. It's a post-apocalyptic novel. It's got kind of sci-fi. It's about mental health issues.
00:06:37.680 Is he psychotic? Is he not? There there's all kinds of philosophical issues raised in this movie. But I don't think a lot of people saw this movie.
00:06:43.680 Yeah, I haven't seen it. But you love Brad Pitt, too. But but I watched this movie and and now like he he's extraordinary in this
00:06:50.080 movie. Now my appreciation of this guy is continuing to expand. 1999 he does
00:06:55.440 the fight club which is a very controversial movie gets a lot of attention but again I I kind of see this
00:07:01.280 guy's journey towards mastery. Right.
00:07:06.400 2004 he does Troy. I'm I'm skipping a lot of movies he's done by the way. These are just ones. He
00:07:13.360 he does a movie Troy which is about the Iliad. Homer's the Iliad. I love Homer's the Iliad. It's one of my favorite
00:07:18.800 books. It's a brilliant book about war. He does this. That's a risk. It's not particularly a stretch for him in this
00:07:25.759 movie, but he's good. In 2008, he does Benjamin Button.
00:07:33.840 He's nominated for best actor. He's nominated for best actor by the Academy.
00:07:39.360 In 2011, he does Moneyball. Brilliant. He's brilliant in this movie, right?
00:07:44.880 He's also nominated for best actor. 2014 Fury
00:07:50.319 again. He's exceptional in this this role. Um
00:07:56.479 2015, he does The Big Short. every one of these roles he I mean he he
00:08:03.039 he sort of has a particular type in these movies but but you also like for
00:08:09.120 me I'm also seeing him expanding his repertoire a little bit taking some risks like with Troy growing as an actor
00:08:16.400 right so what's fascinating to me is you got this this guy from an area from
00:08:21.520 Oklahoma that you never think would become a mega star he's really committed to his craft he's really growing right
00:08:29.440 and then After the big short, there's a bombshell in 2016.
00:08:35.519 And this bombshell is that Angelina Jolie accuses him of
00:08:41.599 abuse. Yeah. On a plane specifically. But but essentially there's this war between
00:08:49.440 himself and Angelina Jolie. There's two mega stars. Two mega stars. There's this issue over
00:08:54.640 custody, right? There there's all kinds of issues here. There's there's I
00:08:59.839 believe it's a bitter divorce. It's a bitter divorce. I believe there's there's there's all kinds of accusations
00:09:05.040 being levied. And before this, by the way, I should point out like the paparazzi are all over Brad Pitt
00:09:10.800 wherever he goes. There's married to Jennifer Aniston. Marries to Jennifer Aniston. Before
00:09:16.000 cheating scandal, right? There's issues about fidelity, right? Like anything the tabloid can get
00:09:21.120 their hands on. Any salacious story about Brad Pitt, they're publishing that, right? I see this stuff, but I
00:09:27.920 don't really pay much attention to it because I don't really care. I want to go to his movies. I'm invested in this
00:09:33.760 guy as an actor and watching him grow and change and master his craft. Right. You're interested in his craft, his art,
00:09:40.240 right? So,
00:09:46.800 it's interesting because in 2016, and I could be wrong about this, but so these these allegations are levied by someone
00:09:54.240 who has tremendous power in Hollywood. And I believe that because of this,
00:09:59.600 there's certainly an attempt to tarnish his reputation, to maybe cancel him, right? Like there's
00:10:08.000 this whole debate about should Brad Pit be doing movies, right?
00:10:14.800 I'm sure people have mixed feelings about this. He was never formally charged
00:10:20.240 with anything. He was never criminally charged, but after 2016, it it does
00:10:26.800 appear that a lot of his roles are lesser roles. It appears that he's doing movies that aren't quite as they don't
00:10:34.320 quite have the heft and the the the
00:10:39.360 reach of movies he's done before. So, the reason I read that list of movies prior to is because I don't I don't know
00:10:47.760 exactly what was going behind the scenes. I don't know if the impact of
00:10:55.279 accusations was affecting his ability to get better films.
00:11:03.200 Like, I I just don't know. Um, and so I'm going to leave I'm going to
00:11:08.480 leave us here for a minute. I'm going to leave us with the accusations, the
00:11:15.920 the his the trajectory of his career that apparently seems to stall around 2016, right?
00:11:22.480 And I'm I'm going to dive into something else, which is something that's called psychological essentialism.
00:11:30.320 and psychological essentialism and and there
00:11:35.839 there's different types of there's different kinds of psychological essentialism but but fundamentally
00:11:41.360 psychological essentialism is about the idea that things or people have an underlying reality. So there's something
00:11:48.399 called category essentialism which is that you might take an attribute or
00:11:55.120 something that of a person and you're going to you're going to generalize from that and make assumptions about who that
00:12:01.680 person is. Okay. So in other words, you want to categorize someone. So psychological essentialism is about
00:12:08.880 trying to find some underlying category reality about a person or a thing.
00:12:14.959 Typically in psychological essentialism you might take
00:12:20.880 an attribute or a behavior even one just one and you'll generalize from that to
00:12:26.000 categorize the person in question. So one of the authors that the one of the psychologists his name is Paul Bloom he
00:12:32.160 teaches at Yale he does research he wrote a book called how pleasure works where he has some interesting chapters
00:12:38.399 on psychological centralism. Um the reason by the way he talks about it in terms of pleasure is because he
00:12:44.880 argues strongly that psychological essentialism underlies a lot of our experience of pleasure and the sense
00:12:51.920 that there are certain things that
00:12:58.160 that that essentialism helps us with in terms of
00:13:04.079 developing certain desires or motivations for something. So there's another type of psychological
00:13:10.399 essentialism called life force essentialism which I don't I don't want to get into that now. We'll talk about it later. But for now I I want to talk
00:13:17.920 about psychological essentialism. And I'm actually going to I'm going to read
00:13:24.880 I'm going to read this was Paul Bloom in his book called How Pleasure Works.
00:13:31.920 Why we like what we like. I like the subtitle. So I'm going to throw that out there. it he talks about there's a
00:13:37.600 subject in one of his studies. It's a four-year-old and he talks about it. He he gives an example of psychological essentialism
00:13:43.680 and here's what he said. So they interviewed this four-year-old um and he was describing what he
00:13:49.040 perceived to be a violent playmate. So here's what he says.
00:13:54.639 The four-year-old Gabe quote Gabriel didn't just hurt me, he hurt other kids,
00:14:00.720 too. He's a herder. Right, Mom? He's a herder.
00:14:06.639 The child, here's Bloom, the child is presumably stressing that this sort of behavior reflects a deeper aspect of
00:14:13.760 Gabriel's nature. So, what Bloom is saying
00:14:20.720 that's of interest here is
00:14:26.480 that if a child is on the playground, let's and let's say we don't know the context, right? Let's say that that
00:14:32.560 child is having a really bad day. Let's say his father yelled at him that morning. Let's say his father maybe even
00:14:38.240 pushed him, right? This kid Gabriel comes to school and he he acts out. He
00:14:43.920 in he hits another child. Okay, maybe he pushes another child and this four-year-old sees it and his conclusion
00:14:50.720 is that Gabriel is essentially a herder. He's a bad kid and you need to stay away
00:14:55.839 from him. without knowing anything about Gabriel, without knowing Gabriel's story. Right?
00:15:02.480 So, you're going from this one particular behavior and you're generalizing. And and the the important point here is
00:15:09.760 that kids as young as two and three and four, this is what they do. They start
00:15:17.519 labeling and categorizing behaviors. Okay? And putting them into categories.
00:15:23.600 Putting them in categories. trying to make it trying to oversimplify it. Right? So, they're you're essentially
00:15:29.680 seeing at like this four-year-old, you're seeing one particular behavior, which is this kid Gabriel hitting
00:15:35.680 another kid apparently. We don't know why, right? We don't know the context. We don't know anything
00:15:40.720 about his home life. And then a four-year-old is drawing the conclusion that that's a bad kid.
00:15:46.240 In general terms, it broad terms. Correct. It's oversimplifying. Oversimplified. So what's important here
00:15:53.839 is not only does this happen at a young age, but it it it it
00:16:00.639 solidifies over the course of our lifespan. So in other words, adults are still looking to categorize people.
00:16:07.920 The same way they're looking for a specific instance or behavior to say
00:16:12.959 that's a herder. So here's an example. Let's say someone writes some private
00:16:18.639 tax messages that aren't meant that with the expectation of privacy, right? And let's
00:16:25.600 say those messages are part of a group where the group the culture of that group is to roast other people. That
00:16:31.040 culture of that group is to make fun of other people and to just blow off steam to vent, right?
00:16:38.240 And let's say that one of those private messages, just one or maybe some, a few,
00:16:43.279 they're released publicly. Not to mention the ethical and moral issues about betraying someone's privacy and
00:16:50.079 their friendship and trust. That's a different issue. That's a that's that's more of a ethical issue, right? But so
00:16:56.000 let's just say that somebody releases a private message or series of private
00:17:01.120 messages and they get out to certain people. Um so an example of
00:17:07.039 psychological essentialism is you take one of those messages out of context out of context
00:17:13.199 meant to be private. You take one of those messages and then you develop
00:17:20.480 a sticky
00:17:25.839 label that you apply to the person
00:17:31.600 that wrote that private or those private messages, right? So, let's say that some of those messages were snarky or let's
00:17:38.960 say that some of those messages were edgy. Let's say they were a little bit maybe they were sarcastic, right? But
00:17:46.720 they were in the context of a group where that wasn't to be shared.
00:17:51.840 Psychological essentialism suggests that certain people will take those messages
00:17:57.280 that weren't meant to be shared and they will develop categories. They will label people
00:18:05.360 bad. They will label people as being immoral because of that type of behavior
00:18:12.640 without looking at the context, without considering that person's history, without considering that person's life.
00:18:20.320 Right? Like that's what So, it's the four-year-old
00:18:26.559 watching one particular behavior and coming to the conclusion that Gabriel is
00:18:31.600 a hurtter. Right? And that's a moral judgment by the way which is going to take us to the next step of this
00:18:37.440 process. So one of the things one of the interesting things about psychological essentialism is that human beings this
00:18:44.240 is true across all cultures. This research is invariant. This research is
00:18:50.320 as universal as you can get in our field in the field of psychology.
00:18:56.160 The finding is that human beings because of psychological essentialism, they believe that we all have more or less
00:19:02.160 what's called a true self. So we have this core self, this true self. Human beings also believe that not only
00:19:08.799 do we have this true self, but this true self is morally virtuous.
00:19:14.880 So this is another part of the finding. So you have a true self that's essential
00:19:19.919 that that s that self most people believe that that self in themselves and
00:19:25.679 others is morally virtuous and then we get to another piece of this puzzle. So,
00:19:30.960 not only is do people see a true self that's morally virtuous, but they
00:19:36.640 believe because of this, they believe human beings across all cultures believe that
00:19:43.919 there's an intrinsic goodness to them and they also believe there's an intrinsic goodness in the groups that
00:19:51.440 they participate in or involved in. So
00:19:57.280 I'm going to read from a book here. I'm going to read this psychologist Keith
00:20:02.960 Payne who summarized this point. What's this book? It's called Good Reasonable People.
00:20:09.360 Keith Payne is a psychologist at the University of North Carolina. He's done a lot of research on social psychology.
00:20:17.120 Keith Payne calls these assumptions quote the psychological bottom line. the
00:20:22.240 psychological bottom line. What that means is pain is saying that universally
00:20:28.799 across all cultures, human beings always come back to the psychological bottom line. I'm going to read what he says.
00:20:35.039 This is on page 41. The first non-negotiable principle is
00:20:40.480 that I am a good and reasonable person. The second principle is that quote my
00:20:47.679 groups are good and reasonable people. goes on, when the psychological immune
00:20:53.919 system, that means defense mechanism, that's what researchers call it. Okay? Defense mechanism. When the psychological immune system
00:21:00.400 protects us from threats, it does it by finding a way to make everything else
00:21:07.520 add up to the psychological bottom line. In other words, human beings,
00:21:13.039 we think that there's a true self, that it's moral and it's good, and we will do everything in our power
00:21:21.440 to make sure that people perceive us as good or to ostracize those people that we
00:21:28.000 don't see as good. So in other words, it's fundamental to human beings.
00:21:33.919 This idea of morality is fundamental to human beings. It's a part of our makeup. It's how people see other human beings,
00:21:41.039 right? I'm going to read this is from an article
00:21:47.520 by Julian Defrritos. Okay. Julian Defrritos teaches at Harvard.
00:21:54.320 He's done a huge amount of He's a psychologist at Harvard. He's done a huge amount of research on this idea of what he calls the good true self.
00:22:00.720 Is it from cognitive science? Cognitive science multi-disiplinary 2017 volume 42. I'm just reading from
00:22:08.480 the abstract. Quote, he's here's how he summarizes it. Quote, "People sometimes explain
00:22:13.760 behavior by appealing to an essentialist concept of the self, often referred to as the true self. Existing studies
00:22:21.120 suggest that people tend to believe that the true self is morally
00:22:26.320 virtuous. That is that deep inside every person is motivated to behave in morally good
00:22:33.360 ways. So I'm trying to establish the fact here
00:22:39.440 that human beings see themselves as moral creatures. We operate on moral ground
00:22:45.120 typically and that's how we that's how we evaluate other people, right? That's how we kind of live our lives.
00:22:53.039 Um I'm going to go further with this idea. So
00:22:59.760 there's been some interesting research by uh Strowinger and Nicholls. I'm going
00:23:05.679 to this is from an article called neurodeeneration and identity. It is
00:23:10.799 2015 from psychological science. What they did in this study is they looked at
00:23:17.679 a bunch of people that had traumatic brain injuries or brain injuries or or dementia and they they
00:23:24.880 were trying to evaluate that when somebody is basically losing their identity because of dementia when
00:23:30.080 they're losing their memory, do other human beings evaluate them in terms of memory loss or some other way?
00:23:37.520 Yeah. And incredibly, this is incredibly what they found, what they discovered is that
00:23:45.679 as long as the the person perceived some type of moral
00:23:50.880 foundation that still or moral part of the person, foundation that still existed in the person, they then saw
00:23:58.000 that person as still being the same. if they had no memory of who they were
00:24:03.679 and there was no there was no ability for the person with the dementia
00:24:09.440 to still hold on to any type of moral principles or moral behaviors. Yeah.
00:24:14.559 Then they didn't see that as the same person. So in other words, what they found was it wasn't memory
00:24:22.640 that determined whether we saw whether you see someone with dementia or brain injury in the same way. It was morality.
00:24:31.120 It was morals. That's how strong that's how strong this is, right? That's how we are judging.
00:24:38.320 So, let's go back. We're assessing. Let's this I'm going to just quote from this this article um neurog neur
00:24:44.960 neurodeeneration and identity. Quote, this is from page 1477.
00:24:51.360 Quote, the current results support the essential moral self hypothesis.
00:24:57.039 As long as core moral capabilities are preserved, perceived identity remains largely
00:25:03.760 intact. So in other words, as long as one's core moral capabilities
00:25:10.480 are preserved. Even if you have brain injury, uh memory loss, dementia, right? Any
00:25:16.559 type of dementia, as long as people perceive you have moral capabilities,
00:25:23.440 they still believe it's you. They still believe it's your identity. Okay, let's go a step further with this idea.
00:25:30.320 There's a fascinating study from
00:25:35.360 Hawk Stadler at L from 2009. The title of this
00:25:40.400 article is that's not who I am. How offenders commit violent acts and reject
00:25:46.320 authentically violent selves. The f I think the title speaks for itself. The finding of the story is that
00:25:54.480 even the most hardened violent criminals go to extreme lengths to see themselves
00:26:00.400 as good, reasonable people. It goes back to Payne's
00:26:06.559 fundamental psychological principle. Yeah. I'm going to read here.
00:26:14.159 I'm going to read a little bit from this study just to make this point. Page 510.
00:26:20.720 quote, "The assessment of a nonviolent character is a foundation or core belief
00:26:26.720 upon which inmates rationalizations were constructed. With it, violence is framed
00:26:32.480 as transient and situational and thus could not be accurately viewed as a trait or defect of the offender."
00:26:40.159 Okay? By relying on a variety of situational justifications for their violence, offenders resisted internal
00:26:47.520 and external labels of being violent, at least as they defined it.
00:26:52.960 They engaged in violence but distanced themselves from it by pointing to
00:26:58.640 situations or circumstances that caused their actions. So what does this mean?
00:27:04.880 Yeah, tell us what it means that there's this deep
00:27:10.960 propensity for human beings to see others as moral, to judge them as moral
00:27:16.000 and to see themselves as good and to see to judge others as either
00:27:22.720 good or bad. Right? In other words, I guess the way to put this is the fundamental theater in which human
00:27:29.440 beings operate, which is the world. Let's call it the theater, I guess, because we all have different roles.
00:27:34.720 is a morality play. We live most of us because we put so
00:27:41.360 much emphasis on morality. We essentially live in a morality play in our daily lives all the time. And
00:27:48.400 this has to do with you see this everywhere, right? People judging others, people gossiping, people
00:27:55.120 spreading rumors. Sounds like Chad Del's light or dark scales. I'm going to be honest.
00:28:00.880 Well, that's that's part of this. That's right. That's part of this.
00:28:07.360 You're either good or you're bad.
00:28:12.480 So, let's get back to Brad Pitt. So, now
00:28:18.159 that I now that I've talked about these ideas of the what's called the the essential moral self,
00:28:25.760 let's get back to Brad Pitt. Okay. So, Brad Pitt has this allegation. I think Brad's cute, but
00:28:31.279 yeah, that that's fine. And I think he's a great actor. That's fine. Yeah. But I haven't assessed him the way you have. I know you've always loved Brad
00:28:36.960 Pitt and his craft. Let's go back to Brad Pitt. So, and and I don't want to minimize what happened,
00:28:43.600 right? Like if in fact he did abuse or Right. That's
00:28:49.360 appalling. I'm I'm obviously never You don't know what happened. I don't we don't know. I'm never going to support that. Right. But but but the
00:28:56.480 the point is back in 2016 when this happened, what you get in these types of
00:29:02.880 situations is you get this this large kind of
00:29:09.679 morality plate. what you get, the best way I could describe it is that people
00:29:15.120 become involved in what I would call a moral crusade. And
00:29:24.000 the the moral crusade is
00:29:30.559 I think the moral crusade exists mainly because humans are very prone to
00:29:37.679 making moral judgments. And as I just said, and and when they
00:29:44.399 when they perceive someone as bad or when someone is labeled as bad, the goal ultimately is to ostracize them from the
00:29:50.720 group or groups, right? And so that in a sense that is in essence is an attempt to cancel someone.
00:29:58.399 You label someone bad, you get them ostracized from groups, you ruin their reputation. Right? Part of that was
00:30:04.399 going on with Brad Pitt. And you might say, okay, what? So, who
00:30:11.200 cares why? Let's say this is a moral crusade that people are trying to paint Brad Pitt as evil so he never works
00:30:17.120 again in Hollywood. They're trying to get him, right? Right. To punish him for his for his so-called
00:30:22.240 moral moral shortfallings. Right. Moral shortcomings. Shortcomings. Um,
00:30:31.919 and I think there's there's something really interesting here that we need to
00:30:38.080 consider that applies to our situation. And this is where this is important.
00:30:44.159 The problem Angelina Jolie had in trying to make this a moral crusade was that
00:30:50.399 that Brad Pitt has this body of work which is indisputably good. Right? He's
00:30:56.320 got this body of work and he's he's he's becoming an actor that's mastering his
00:31:01.840 craft. That's why I'm interested in the guy. Like I love watching people master craft. You always say make good art,
00:31:08.320 right? I love excellence, right? And so I strive for that myself. I say the valictorian who got accepted to
00:31:15.039 Harvard, Princeton, Yale, and Colombia, and you know, said no to most of them. Sorry,
00:31:20.799 I'm gonna brag, but he's not a real psychologist, guys. Just pretend the theater of Princeton.
00:31:28.799 Go ahead. I love people that strive for excellence. I see Brad Pitt is fitting that mold. Right. And so when she shifts
00:31:35.760 this debate into makes it a moral crusade, there's a big problem. And that problem
00:31:41.519 is that Brad Pitt's body of work and the quality of his work are indisputably
00:31:48.960 good. I mean, you know what? Some critics may disagree with me. I'm sure there's critics that hate Brad Pitt. They think he's a hacked actor, but I'm
00:31:55.679 not one of those, right? And so if the goal is to cancel Brad Pitt
00:32:02.159 and you're a fan of Brad Pitt like I am, my response to that was, okay, you know,
00:32:09.200 maybe he's got some problems in his personal life, you know, maybe he whatever. I'm not excusing it. Maybe he
00:32:15.360 feels overwhelmed by having all these kids, a massive career, be one of the biggest stars in the world like you and
00:32:21.279 I. I think he's admitted to alcoholism. He's struggling with addiction, right?
00:32:26.720 He's certainly not perfect. He's got some issues. You and I are His life is messy. You and I are such I'm I'm whatever the
00:32:36.080 the celebrity scale is. You and I are like a pittance
00:32:41.440 compared to Brad Pitt, right? I can't even imagine. Yeah, we're not a thing. I can't even imagine the stress
00:32:48.799 and expectations and criticism this guy has to deal with, right? Like I don't think any of us can imagine that.
00:32:55.519 I can't imagine that for Taylor Swift. Like some of the biggest stars in the world, The Rock, I don't know how they
00:33:00.720 handle all this stuff. I don't either. I really don't. Right. So like YouTube's enough for me.
00:33:07.039 So my my thing is so this is this is happening. And you know there's there's stuff before about affairs and I'm just
00:33:13.440 like the guy does good work. I love the fact that this guy is trying
00:33:20.080 to master his craft, right? What I care about is the quality of his work, his art, his craft.
00:33:26.640 The quality of his work. And so I I think it's interesting
00:33:34.480 that in our current it's interesting that like Brad Pitt being being accused
00:33:42.799 of abuse in 2016
00:33:48.000 that the the situation you're in h this whole smear campaign from the start that
00:33:55.519 every bit of this is about a moral referendum. on you and your
00:34:01.600 character. Every bit of this is become a moral crusade, right? And what I find fascinating about
00:34:09.119 that is that this debate is not happening in the
00:34:16.800 realm of, oh, what's the quality of Lauren's work?
00:34:21.839 What's the quality of Hidden True Crimes work? Right? Like I could argue with Brad Pitt for example
00:34:28.879 that this attempt to shift the debate to this moral crusade to this moral issue
00:34:35.679 but it it's certainly an attempt to shift the debate away from his work as
00:34:40.800 an artist and an actor to something else to something about his character to
00:34:46.320 something about his morals and his right and and the question is
00:34:52.879 so and by the way with You you you weren't accus You've never done anything
00:34:58.480 like that ever. Like you've never done anything wrong. Well, my eyebrows are a sin,
00:35:06.240 right? Yeah. You may have to shave those. Um,
00:35:11.760 you know, we've we've received I love myself some Botox. We've received some emails. I think
00:35:17.280 there there's there's I want to point I want to read a comment we received by
00:35:24.000 Pinñata Samurai. I love that name by the way. Thanks Pinñata Samurai. Um this is a comment
00:35:29.920 this is a comment that I I love that summarizes this whole thing up. We
00:35:35.440 received a brilliant text from in comments or I'm
00:35:41.599 sorry a brilliant message in comments from one of our viewers. And here's what
00:35:48.160 Pinñata Samurai said. Love the name, by the way. I know. Pinñata Samurai. It's so great.
00:35:54.800 Next time I do, next time I go to a pinñata party with our son, I'm going to call myself Piñata Samurai. Um,
00:36:01.920 quote, "Even if you were the devil himself, I'd still watch you. You're
00:36:07.920 brilliant at what you do. You and your husband both.
00:36:15.680 Right. And and so the reason that's relevant,
00:36:22.079 I'm not the devil. The reason that's relevant, I know you're not the devil. It's It's making a point. Obviously, you're not
00:36:29.280 the devil. Only when you lock me in my cage in the garage. Um
00:36:35.520 the reason why that's brilliant is because I think it really gets to the core of this debate. Just like Brad Pitt, right? Why isn't anybody debating
00:36:44.000 this on the terrain of our work?
00:36:50.640 Why is this why is this being litigated as a moral referendum? Right? And
00:36:56.240 there's another question in here. If you're going to engage in a moral crusade, which is what all the people in this mirror campaign have done, if
00:37:02.800 you're going to do that, you're going to have to have some moral authority, right? The other part of engaging in a
00:37:08.400 moral crusade is you're going to have you need probably
00:37:13.520 some bank account, some credits, some moral credits to bolster your position,
00:37:18.800 right? Like and think about let's think about that with your situation, right? Like does someone who was kicked out of
00:37:26.960 the Del trial for violating all court a number of court regulations multiple
00:37:32.560 times. Does that person have moral authority to comment on your character? I'm not going to say
00:37:38.720 how about this? How about this? Somebody who took your phone without your consent and went through your phone and the
00:37:45.040 financials that were in your phone. This person knew this person knew that they were never to access our financials.
00:37:52.079 That's our business. That person gets in your phone, looks at
00:37:57.440 your financial situ, looks at your financials without
00:38:02.880 your consent. Does that person have the moral authority to engage in a moral
00:38:08.079 crusade to ruin you? Or how about this? someone who makes comments
00:38:14.000 on a Tik Tok about your brother in a coma
00:38:21.200 and how you want to nonconsensually try to obtain your brother's sperm.
00:38:28.640 Does that person have the moral authority to engage in a crusade, a moral crusade to ruin your character?
00:38:37.599 Or how about this? somebody who follows you around the courthouse,
00:38:42.800 videotaping you, video recording you, constantly getting in your face. And
00:38:50.320 because of that type of behavior, is not allowed to attend the memorial
00:38:56.800 service that you put on, helped put on, that you helped organize, participated in helping organize.
00:39:03.440 my my dear friend actually does that person have the moral authority
00:39:09.280 to engage in this moral crusade against you? Right? So my point is that if
00:39:15.359 you're going to engage in a moral crusade, you better be squeaky clean and
00:39:20.640 you like my point is that we all have flaws.
00:39:26.640 You're getting to the parable in the Bible, whoever hasn't sinned cast the first stone. It's a good one. We all
00:39:32.240 have flaws. We all have imperfections. And so people make mistakes. You've made
00:39:38.960 some mistakes here. You've acknowledged that. The question is that if you're going to if you're going to engage in
00:39:45.920 this type of moral crusade, that at some level you're going to need some moral authority to do that. And and
00:39:52.320 what does that even mean? I mean, we I could talk for the next five hours about what moral authority means. We could
00:39:58.079 talk about morality. I won't. I'll just say this. morality to everyone is different, right? What is moral and what isn't?
00:40:03.920 I'll just say this to each person that that
00:40:11.760 moral authority is derived from a couple of places. It's derived from your behavior and it's derived from the
00:40:17.520 community in which that behavior occurs. Right? You get moral authority because the
00:40:23.119 community confers it on you for either good or bad behavior, let's say, right?
00:40:30.079 Mhm. And so it's interesting that that everyone involved in the smear campaign
00:40:37.440 is claiming this moral high ground and they're claiming this this
00:40:45.359 moral authority to engage in this ref to engage in this
00:40:51.040 smear campaign and bullying and stalking against you
00:40:57.119 because they're morally correct. Right? Because they're right. They're going to show they're they're desperately trying
00:41:03.280 to show that you've done something wrong, that you're a bad person, and you should be cancelled. That
00:41:10.079 Yeah. Well, and how about also this this you're someone is either all good or all bad. I mean, that's what you were saying at the beginning of this, you know,
00:41:16.319 that gets that gets into psychological essentialism. Exactly. So, it's it's like the fourth grader.
00:41:23.040 It's like the fourth grader watching the four-year-old. I mean, I'm sorry, the four I meant the four. Yeah. Even worse. It's like the
00:41:28.400 four-year-old watching a little child punch another kid. Maybe that again, maybe the Gabriel had a bad day and then
00:41:34.319 coming to the conclusion that's a herder. That this is a version of that. And by the way, part of that part of the
00:41:40.720 reason that's important is because there is a tremendous amount of immaturity here,
00:41:47.520 right? like these smear people are enga we've seen so many comments about this
00:41:53.520 that how childish this is how middle schoolish this is right and it's it's
00:41:59.520 almost like it's almost like you're taking that four-year-old and you're showing the four-year-old one
00:42:07.040 text that may have been a little snarky and the four-year-old's coming to the
00:42:12.160 conclusion oh that's a herder that's a herder right it's it's a similar dynamic Yeah.
00:42:19.520 So, I I think there's there's a couple of issues here that are worth talking about. One is that there's a deliberate
00:42:27.359 attempt here, I think, to shift this debate away from your work, our work, the quality of our work.
00:42:33.839 Like technically Brad Pitt with Brad Pitt,
00:42:40.079 I don't really care what's going on in his personal life. I'm just interested in his mastery of acting and his journey
00:42:46.480 towards mastery and I and I've been invested in that for a long time. As a matter of fact, I have a quote from a
00:42:51.680 critic. This is recently. So, Brad Pitt did a recent movie called F1, which I love, by the way. Um, I thought he was
00:42:59.359 great. I mean, it's it wasn't much of a stretch for him. It was probably a very easy role, but he was fantastic. I love
00:43:05.680 the movie. It was exciting. Anyway, there's a critic, her name is Angelica
00:43:12.960 Bastian. She's she apparently does some some movie reviews for uh The Vulture.
00:43:20.079 Okay. And I guess I don't I guess part of the debate that was going on with F1 was
00:43:29.119 around this idea of well, he's what if he's an abuser? Should we should we give
00:43:35.599 any credence to this movie or to Brad Pitt as an actor? Like, shouldn't we just It was about cancelling him
00:43:41.359 essentially. And here's what she said. Okay.
00:43:47.359 She said, quote, "It isn't that people don't believe what happened to Jolie on that plane.
00:43:55.119 It's just that they don't care."
00:44:01.599 And why is that important? Because what this critic is saying is
00:44:10.000 the people understand that if you're that the the humans make mistakes, humans are imperfect.
00:44:16.319 And if you want to make this into a moral crusade, then in many ways you're you're really negating the important
00:44:22.000 point, which is that Brad Pitt is an artist who creates art. He's an actor
00:44:27.119 who acts. Maybe that's the realm where he should be evaluated. Maybe that's what the
00:44:33.599 critic's saying. Maybe we should pay attention to his to his role in this movie and and whether the movie is good and how he how well his acting, you
00:44:40.319 know, how well he acted in it rather than litigating something from 2016,
00:44:46.720 which although potentially horrible,
00:44:51.760 it doesn't affect his acting. I mean, it may have. It probably affected him psychologically. I'm sure he was hurt by
00:44:58.160 it, maybe. I don't know. I presume. And so here with you, with us,
00:45:05.280 this whole smear campaign has been a referendum on your character. It's been a referendum. It's been a moral
00:45:11.440 referendum on you and who you are rather than
00:45:19.119 a critique or analysis of your work. Yeah. Or Yeah. And so I'm fascinated by
00:45:27.280 that because it it's hard not to say that the reason that that debate the
00:45:32.960 reason why this has nothing to do with your work. Although I will say we have gotten a lot of emails from people
00:45:39.760 that are very praiseworthy of our work and that see this for what they see that you've done nothing wrong
00:45:47.920 and even if you made a few mistakes they're willing to forgive you because as Pinñata Samurai said she loves your
00:45:55.040 work right here's I'm going to read a message we just got today I'm not going to say the name because I
00:46:01.040 don't know if I'm authorized but she says quote Hello. I want to tell you
00:46:06.560 how much how much I appreciate the quality, credibility, and positive nature of your work. You don't deserve
00:46:14.640 the abuse you're experiencing. I love that because it's the same thing that
00:46:19.760 Piñata Samurai is saying. It's the same thing that Brad Kicks Brad Pitt's movie critic is saying. It's
00:46:26.800 if you reframe this as a moral crusade and not about the quality of your work,
00:46:34.640 it's easier to win to them, to the smear people.
00:46:39.839 It's easier to win that argument because human beings are drawn to that moral
00:46:45.440 crusade. They're drawn into that morality play. For me, I'm less interested in his biography and I'm more
00:46:51.440 interested in in his actual art. Yeah. Yeah. And I want to evaluate him on that terrain. Fair.
00:46:56.560 Rather than in terms of morality, right? But but it shows that human beings have
00:47:02.160 this knee-jerk reaction to go after moral issues. Yeah. In fact, like this whole idea of
00:47:09.280 cancel culture, this whole idea of harming people on the internet is based
00:47:14.640 on this moral this idea of humans being moral creatures on moral crusades
00:47:21.839 trying to assert their moral superiority. Yeah.
00:47:27.119 With or without often most often without moral authority. But a moral authority is a tricky issue. So I don't want to
00:47:33.920 get into that too much. I mean, because, you know, ironically, I think some of the people on the smear campaign would
00:47:39.599 would say that their moral authority comes from God. And so, I I think I think that in this
00:47:46.560 smear campaign, I think there's a religious component, right? So, if if
00:47:52.319 you have God on your side and you're right, so being right in this
00:47:57.520 case means that they're morally superior and they're right because they're they're trying to show
00:48:04.640 that you are immoral and that you have poor character and therefore you should be cancelled. And
00:48:10.640 they're trying to show that with evidence that's flimsy at best
00:48:18.400 or with evidence that you know that with evidence that you've seen and apologized for. I mean,
00:48:28.960 yeah, but I I just think
00:48:37.760 I think that's problematic. So, let let's take it a step further.
00:48:44.240 So, people are going to say, "Oh, what? So, what?" All right. So people can get so so people engage in this moral
00:48:49.359 crusade and people are people see themselves as good fundamentally and moral blah blah
00:48:56.079 blah. Who cares, right? So okay, so Brad Pitt, you know, may have done this
00:49:02.480 abusive thing. Maybe some people think they should cancel him for that. Maybe they don't
00:49:08.480 care about his work, right? Like so people are saying maybe all right
00:49:17.200 so they're going after you for being immoral or whatever people are trying to cancel you
00:49:23.599 why should we care
00:49:31.359 and I want to point out like you know I've canceled businesses because their values don't adhere to mine I mean that's fair
00:49:38.640 right like yeah I mean right if people got cancelled not like gone on and tried to start a smear campaign but learned
00:49:45.920 maybe a business isn't one I want to support I'm not suggesting
00:49:52.720 and if people feel that about us I get it I'm not suggesting that I'm not saying I'm I'm just I'm pointing out the
00:50:00.000 disparity between focusing almost exclusively on moral issues right
00:50:05.760 versus ignoring the work right? That if if you see someone as deeply
00:50:11.520 immoral and there's evidence of that, not preconceived notions of it,
00:50:17.599 Mhm. then yeah, I think I think you know you sure people have the right to judge
00:50:24.319 things as being immoral and not consistent with their values and then not caring like not paying attention to
00:50:29.599 someone's work. That makes perfect sense. Yeah. But on the other hand, there's certain
00:50:35.119 people like me. There might be moral questions around Brad Pitt, but I don't it doesn't really affect me. I'm
00:50:40.880 interest I'm not really interested in his personal life. For you, it's about his his work. Right. Now, there might be
00:50:46.880 some people that say, "Oh my gosh, I'm never going to see another movie by him." That's their choice. Yeah, that's fine. That's what I'm
00:50:52.000 saying. Yeah. There's some businesses I thought, "Oh, I don't want to, you know, support that business because maybe I
00:50:57.520 found out their founder isn't someone um who holds my, you know, same beliefs and
00:51:06.079 then I'll end up actually supporting them because they make a good chicken sandwich." So, happens.
00:51:13.839 So the the next step in this is the next step in this is if if humans
00:51:20.960 are essentially moral creatures and that's how we see the world and evaluate them and we all want to be good. The
00:51:26.000 question is one of the questions that arises from that is
00:51:32.800 how do we maintain that? So when when there's threats to our moral character
00:51:39.839 how do we maintain that perspective? How do we see ourselves as good? And the answer is there's something called the
00:51:45.119 cognitive response principle. Okay, the cognitive response principle basically says that any information you
00:51:51.359 get is only can confirm whatever beliefs or
00:51:57.200 perspectives you have. So in other words, you can get information that contradicts your your identity or
00:52:04.960 your view of the world and you're going to disregard it. You don't care, right? because that you're going to what you're
00:52:11.119 going to do the cognitive response crystal basically says that all persuasion is self-persuasion meaning
00:52:17.200 you're going to get that information you're going to come up with a lot of reasons why it's wrong even though it's correct
00:52:23.839 somebody gives you evidence of something you're going to come up with a lot of reasons about
00:52:28.960 why that's wrong and why you're still a good person. There's also something we talk about all the time which is confirmation bias. confirmation biases.
00:52:36.480 You take evidence or information, you find the parts that confirm your view, you disregard the parts that don't,
00:52:42.880 right? And all of a sudden, you still believe the same thing. So, part of this is that if you're that
00:52:50.480 four-year-old kid who thinks that Gabriel's a hurtter,
00:52:57.200 and let's say that kid grows up with Gabriel, let's say he lives in the same neighborhood, that kid at four thinks
00:53:02.960 Gabriel's a herder. every bit of information that
00:53:08.720 four-year-old gets from there on out until they're adults.
00:53:14.319 He could use to either confirm that view or he could get information that Gabriel, in fact, is a really good kid.
00:53:20.800 He's in the Boy Scouts. But you might take, let's say, he might but he would take that information and disregard it
00:53:26.720 and tell you why Gabriel is still such a bad kid. Because you could also say, "Oh, he's in
00:53:32.480 the Boy Scouts. Not good. What? I I
00:53:37.520 depending on how you see the voice guest or how you want to see Gabriel to your point. I'm I'm using that. I'm using that.
00:53:44.319 Yeah, that's true. But it's good. That was actually a great example. depending on how you want to see this, good or bad, is how you'll
00:53:51.839 connect the dots to confirm your bias to Gabriel or to create a new um
00:53:59.920 view, right? And this is this is important because if if people are engaged in a
00:54:07.839 smear campaign and they get information that contradicts their belief,
00:54:14.000 they're going to ignore it. Correct? They're going to stay, they're going to stand their moral ground. They're going to stay with their moral
00:54:19.760 superiority. They're going to remain in their self-righteous perspective because they have a moral authority.
00:54:25.040 They'll twist the evidence. They'll edit the evidence. They'll edit it. They'll twist it. They're going to show the evidence out of context,
00:54:31.440 right? They're going to show you whatever they want to show you because of confirmation bias and the cognitive response principle. So, no matter what
00:54:37.760 information you give them, it's not going to move the needle. that's not going to impact their perspective that you're a bad person and
00:54:44.480 you're immoral. And they have to fight that battle on that moral terrain
00:54:50.480 because more than likely it's going to be much more difficult to fight it on the terrain of content and the quality
00:54:55.839 of content. Yeah. But let's move on. So that's important
00:55:01.440 to know because this is why when when evidence comes out to the
00:55:06.720 contrary like you and I have gotten a lot of we've gotten a lot of feedback from
00:55:12.160 people that's been very positive about creators we've helped. Mhm. About victims we've helped. They've
00:55:18.720 reached all these people have reached out to us. Right. That contradicts their narrative. Right.
00:55:23.839 And so therefore that's information that's evidence that contradicts their narrative about how immoral you are.
00:55:29.839 Mhm. Therefore, they're going to use confirmation bias and they're going to use cognitive response principle to
00:55:37.520 negate or deny or minimize or delete all of that information that could change
00:55:43.200 their perspective. Right. That's that's how you continue on a smear campaign. Yeah. You put it on moral terrain. You
00:55:50.720 disengage from every any contrary evidence and that's how you keep going. In fact, that's how you escalate.
00:55:58.480 But let's let's let's take the next step in this analysis and that this is this
00:56:04.799 is a step I love. There's something called the fundamental attribution error.
00:56:10.240 Okay, the fundamental attribution error is probably one of the fundamental principles of psychology. It's been it's
00:56:16.720 been proven over and over again by research. Okay, it's if there if there's such thing as a
00:56:21.839 law in the field of psychology, this would be close to that. Okay. Uh another law uh there's there's
00:56:28.640 a psychologist recently deceased. Mahal Shixen Mihi is his name. He used to
00:56:33.760 teach at the University of Chicago. He taught flow. He wrote about flow. He's the kind of the father of that.
00:56:43.040 He believed that Lord Actton's law was also a similar law. Lord Actton's law
00:56:49.760 I'm just throwing this out there to give you an example of another law in psychology. Lord Actton's law says
00:56:56.319 the power corrupts and absolute power corrupts. Absolutely. Absolute power corrupts corrupts
00:57:03.119 absolutely. So Shik, Mihali, Shik, and Mihi believe that was the law. This is another what I
00:57:08.400 would consider to be close to a law of human behavior. Fundamental attribution error. So what is the fundament the
00:57:14.160 fund? The fundamental attribution error says that human beings overestimate the
00:57:21.920 importance of personality in explaining behavior
00:57:28.400 as opposed to the situation. So let me repeat that that human beings whenever
00:57:34.720 something occurs human beings prefer to explain events in terms of personality
00:57:42.000 rather than the situation. So the evidence for the fundamental attribution
00:57:47.280 error, for example, would be the famous Mgrim experience experiments where you you shock people because the the the
00:57:54.400 experimentter is in the position of an authority figure wearing a lab coat and he says basically shock this person
00:58:01.520 until they're screaming in pain and and subjects do it. They do it because of the situation, not
00:58:08.880 because they're bad people. Yeah. There's the Stanford prison experiments
00:58:16.240 where people are put in the context of a prison and they start acting out like
00:58:21.280 abuse of prison guards, not because they're bad people, but because the prison guards are given too much
00:58:27.920 authority, right? There's the Ash experiments that I've talked about on our Patreon where
00:58:34.799 groups are shown lines of different magnitudes. They're given a reference line and
00:58:40.720 they're shown three lines of different magnitudes and members in the group are Confederates and they're told, "Hey,
00:58:46.240 look, this is clear-cut. There's one line that matches the three, but we want the Confederates to say that this line
00:58:52.880 is actually the wrong line." In other words, to say that this longer line is a
00:58:58.400 shorter one and to get people in that group to believe it. And you know what?
00:59:03.680 75% of the time one of the group members believes that the wrong line is the
00:59:09.280 right line simply because of group peer pressure. Those are all examples of where the
00:59:15.760 situation it's not because these people have defective personalities. No.
00:59:21.760 Group peer pressure. Group peer pressure. So here's here's where the fundamental
00:59:26.880 attribution error is really important in terms of this smear campaign. Okay,
00:59:34.400 I can't stress this enough
00:59:40.480 that almost every person involved in the smear campaign talked about you
00:59:45.920 positively. Yeah, they all talked about you in a positive
00:59:51.920 light. That's true. before you rejected them,
00:59:58.400 before there was a change. Some of them rejected me too.
01:00:04.640 Yeah. But the point is that you were you were essentially positive and then
01:00:11.760 certain circumstances changed it and all of a sudden you became evil, right? How
01:00:17.920 was that relevant? because they saw your personality
01:00:23.599 as good. They saw you as kind. We have messages from people proving this.
01:00:30.079 Yeah. Until their their friendship with you or their
01:00:36.160 relationship with you changed and then all of a sudden they became haters, you
01:00:41.760 became bad. Right? It's the fundamental attribution error. Do you just go? Do
01:00:48.559 you just go from saying, "Oh, you know what? This person is so nice. One of these people
01:00:55.520 that is no longer with us." She said, "Oh, John and Lauren are
01:01:01.520 angels." All right. One of these people said, "Oh, Lauren is so kind."
01:01:08.640 Someone just sent us, we've been getting a lot of messages, by the way, from people that know people. And thank you.
01:01:13.920 Someone else sent us a message from somebody that said they are just as nice as in in person as they are on their
01:01:21.520 podcast and now and now you're evil. So the the issue is
01:01:29.760 this explains it. This fundamental this law of psychology the fundamental attribution error explains it.
01:01:37.119 Is it because you have a defective personality and you're evil and immoral?
01:01:42.400 No. It's the fact that the situation changed. How did it change? Because you
01:01:49.520 either changed their employment, you changed your relationship with them,
01:01:55.040 maybe you had a falling out in your friendship. It wasn't that your personality changed,
01:02:01.280 it's that their status with you changed. And because that status changed, they
01:02:09.119 hate you. So why is this important?
01:02:15.599 Because the all the evidence here suggests that these people all saw you as good and moral and virtuous until
01:02:25.839 something happened. They either rejected you, you rejected them, the friendship changed, right?
01:02:31.440 The situation changed. The situation changed. And so in that sense,
01:02:38.319 it's really no different than the Mgrim experiments in the sense that the situation is being
01:02:44.000 guided by an authority figure. That's how you get the subjects to shock people, right?
01:02:51.040 It's not that the people performing the shock treatments changed their personalities,
01:02:58.160 it's that the situation changed. And so
01:03:04.480 the most compelling evidence and most compelling argument here is you didn't
01:03:09.520 change. Thank you. I know you didn't change. Someone actually tried to tell me that I'd changed. Thank you.
01:03:16.640 You didn't change at all. The situation changed. Their status and relationship with you changed. That's it. You're the
01:03:23.440 same person. Thanks. Still drive you crazy. I can still be annoying.
01:03:32.240 Yeah, you right. You can be annoying. But you know what? I'm an adult. I can handle being called annoying or having
01:03:38.559 people saying they're annoying. Like that's what mature adults do. They can handle being called annoying. I get You
01:03:44.319 can call me annoying, too. You do all the time. So, you can be really annoying. That's what grown-ups do. That's what mature people do. They can handle being
01:03:51.440 labeled something. Yeah.
01:03:57.920 So we're covering a lot of terrain here. Uh
01:04:05.680 fundamental attribution is proof
01:04:11.680 that you're not the one who changed the relationship changed. You're the same person.
01:04:18.799 That doesn't mean you're without flaws. Doesn't mean that you're imperfect. But I'm not I'm not per I am perfect.
01:04:29.839 So let's stay with this idea of morality
01:04:35.920 though. So with you the fundamental what the fundamental
01:04:41.119 attribution error basically says that you went from being a good virtuous moral person and then your relationship
01:04:46.960 with these people changed and now all of a sudden you're immoral, right? You're defective character. That's the argument. It's ridiculous because every
01:04:54.960 single one of these people had a change in relationship status with you and every single one of them turned
01:05:01.839 against you because of it. Not because you changed. And so obviously what does
01:05:06.960 that suggest? That's envy. That's envy. We'll talk about that more
01:05:13.039 later. But before we do, people still might be saying, "All
01:05:18.079 right, whatever. Whatever, John." And like people are moral creatures. They
01:05:23.119 want to think they're good. They they don't change their perspective of themselves. Uh fundamental attribution error. Okay.
01:05:29.839 So what?
01:05:36.319 This is the part I think that's important because now we're going to get into
01:05:42.400 why there are risks here and why this is a real problem.
01:05:49.520 a lot of people, maybe not a lot, I'm sorry, there's some chatter out there
01:05:56.319 that this is just like a big cat fight, right? This is just like a bunch of mean
01:06:02.480 girls going at it. There's no victimization. There's no risk of violence, right? This
01:06:09.680 is just all overblown. I'm going to show you now why that's not true.
01:06:15.920 There's something I'm going to read from a book here. In other words, you're saying that I don't have a stalker and
01:06:21.680 that I did a 9-hour live crying you you were faking the whole thing and you were crying about a cat fight
01:06:28.079 or dramatic and over we'll get to that in a little bit. There's a there's there's a couple of
01:06:35.039 psychologists, Alan Fisk and Taage Ry. They wrote a book called Virtuous
01:06:40.400 Violence. They've done a lot of research on this, by the way. So, there's empirical support for this theory. Okay.
01:06:48.319 But I'm going to read
01:06:57.039 I'm going to read a little bit from their book and and and start explaining
01:07:03.520 why this moral crusade and this desire for certain party this this
01:07:08.960 self-righteous moral, you know, referendum on you is
01:07:16.319 important. So here we go.
01:07:25.359 Most violence, this is according to the theory by Fisk, okay, and Rey, most violence is morally
01:07:33.520 motivated. People do not simply justify or excuse their violent actions after the fact. At
01:07:40.640 the moment they act, people intend to cause harm or death to someone they feel
01:07:46.319 should suffer or die. That is people are impelled to violence when they feel that
01:07:52.799 like when they feel that to regulate certain social relationships imposed suffering or death is imposing suffering
01:07:59.520 or death is necessary, natural, legitimate, desirable, condoned, admired
01:08:06.319 and ethically gratifying. In short, most violence is the exercise of moral
01:08:14.319 rights and obligations. Working within the framework of a
01:08:20.238 relational model's theory, our thesis is that people are morally motivated to do
01:08:26.799 violence to create, conduct, protect, redress, terminate, or mourn social
01:08:33.920 relationships with the victim or with others. We call our theory virtuous
01:08:40.000 violence theory. So why is this important?
01:08:47.520 It's important because there's a lot of evidence suggesting I'm going to read I'm going
01:08:52.960 to read a line in here that I think is really critical.
01:08:58.319 In short, most violence is the exercise of moral rights and obligations. Right.
01:09:10.238 The reason this is important is because virtuous violence theory completely applies to your situation in the sense
01:09:16.479 that the people engaging in the smear campaign feel morally justified. They feel like
01:09:23.520 their moral rights were violated and they want retribution. One of them reposted
01:09:31.120 on her Tik Tok that we should bring back public shaming. That's kind of what you're
01:09:37.839 exactly, which is the Salem witch trials, too. I mean, I guess a lot of people feel that
01:09:42.880 way. Yeah. Clearly, but but the larger point here is that
01:09:49.279 there's research supporting this and and that if if you if you engage in kind of
01:09:54.960 this extreme moral crusade against someone, the natural and logical
01:10:00.640 conclusion to that is harm or death. And if you think about the smear
01:10:06.719 campaign, so the stalker who who began the Tik Tok
01:10:15.600 She says quite clearly
01:10:20.719 that her goal is to burn the kingdom down. Right? It's clear
01:10:28.719 that her goal is not only harm, reputational harm, emotional harm,
01:10:35.280 psychological harm. But the harm the harm that she really wants to affect is
01:10:41.600 to ruin you and ruin your life and burn the whole kingdom down.
01:10:48.000 Right? The goal, so what that's implying
01:10:54.000 is that she won't stop until that harm is that harm is executed and and and
01:11:02.320 complete. So if she burns the kingdom down, then she feels morally vindicated.
01:11:08.719 Or if there's a death, if someone harms themselves or someone
01:11:13.840 harms you, then the game's over. She's morally vindicated. Here's the problem.
01:11:18.960 Here's the risk. This is why this is so risky and so important. Because these
01:11:24.000 people, these self-righteous, morally superior people, they want moral
01:11:31.199 vindication. And they're not going to stop until they get moral vindication. And the way they get moral vindication,
01:11:38.000 the way this game ends is either you're dead or you're completely ruined. That's
01:11:43.840 it. And that, by the way, is malicious intent. One of the things about stalking, and we're going to talk about
01:11:49.760 the definition of stalking in a little bit, there has to be malicious intent. There has to be some intent to cause
01:11:55.760 harm. You have it in spades here. When someone says
01:12:02.000 that they want to burn your kingdom down, when they want to expose you,
01:12:07.120 when they want to harm you,
01:12:12.800 yeah, they feel justified in doing it. They feel as as
01:12:20.000 virtuous violence theory would predict.
01:12:29.120 They feel like they most in short most violence is the exercise of moral rights
01:12:34.239 and obligations. That's exactly what this is. They're exercising in their mind their moral rights and obligations
01:12:42.000 because you harm them, because you're immoral, because you're a bad person.
01:12:47.199 And they will not stop until their goal is met, which is to
01:12:52.400 ruin you or have you end up dead. That's the goal.
01:12:59.280 Let me continue with another I'm going to read another part of this book that's so important.
01:13:09.679 Same book, Virtuous Violence. Same authors. This is page 17. Quote,
01:13:17.679 "Virtuous violence theory proposes that the perpetrator intends to harm or kill
01:13:24.719 in order to constitute a a social relationship to make it correspond
01:13:32.159 with a prescriptive model of what the relationship ought to be, what it must
01:13:38.400 be made to be." In other words,
01:13:44.320 people engage in virtuous violence to get people to conform. And they want
01:13:50.159 them to conform to their perception of a prescriptive model or an ideal of what
01:13:56.640 they think the relationship should be. Yeah.
01:14:02.080 That's conformity. That's all over this that's all over this situation.
01:14:10.560 They're evaluating you, and again, this gets to the question of moral authority.
01:14:15.600 They're evaluating you against an ideal of loyalty and conformity and
01:14:22.320 acquiescence and fitting in above all else. What they're not doing is they're
01:14:28.320 not evaluating against you're not they're not evaluating it against the criteria of quality work.
01:14:34.480 Right. Right. we talked about. They're not evaluating you against the criteria of creativity.
01:14:39.520 They're not evaluating you against the criteria of complexity because they're not allowing you to be complex.
01:14:45.520 No, I need to conform. You need to conform. Right? If you reject them, you're not conforming.
01:14:50.960 You're not loyal. Like one of the themes that you see throughout this entire TikTok is, "Oh, she's a bad friend. I'm
01:14:57.199 going to punish her for being a bad friend. She doesn't know what a friendship is." That's the ideal. That's the reason why there's a there's a real
01:15:04.080 risk of violence here is because number one, this can escalate so easily. And number two,
01:15:10.239 you don't fit that ideal. You never did. You're not conforming to this very
01:15:16.159 narrow, rigid perspective that they want you to fit into of what a friend is and their friend.
01:15:21.199 And yeah, that makes this, by the way, that you know, I mentioned a moral crusade. That
01:15:28.239 makes this an ideological battle in the sense that the fight here is and to them
01:15:35.199 the fight here is good versus evil or good versus bad. They're good, you're
01:15:40.480 evil. And because of that,
01:15:45.600 the only possible way out of this is total ruination of you or death. I'm going to read a quick
01:15:52.640 quote here making this point. This is from a book called Human Destructiveness
01:15:59.040 by Anthony Store. Anthony Store. What? Humans destructive? Wow.
01:16:04.960 Anthony Store is a brilliant British psychiatrist. He's written a lot on a
01:16:10.159 lot of topics. He's he's writing here about obviously human aggression and destructiveness. Here's
01:16:17.120 Anthony Store, page 142.
01:16:23.760 My dogma is quote, "My dogma is that all dogma is suspect." And it seems to me
01:16:29.920 that most of the harm in the world is done by those who are dogmatically certain that they are right.
01:16:37.679 For being absolutely right means that those who disagree are absolutely wrong.
01:16:43.120 Those who are absolutely wrong are of course dangerous to society and must be restrained or eliminated.
01:16:50.719 That is the beginning of the road to the torture chamber and the gas oven.
01:17:00.000 That's what we're talking about. So when people say, "Oh, gee, this is
01:17:05.920 just mean girls. This is just a stupid cat fight." They don't understand what's they don't understand the stakes here.
01:17:12.560 They don't understand what's going on. They don't understand that to the people in the smear campaign, this is a moral
01:17:18.159 crusade. that is reducing you
01:17:24.800 to some someone or something that's subhuman that needs to be destroyed. This is an ideological war against you.
01:17:33.679 And by the way, many of the people in the smear campaign that we have not named are continuing.
01:17:40.320 They have continued. Just so you know, I'm not going to talk about it more than that.
01:17:45.920 Let's talk about some other risks.
01:17:51.440 We will get into we will get into defining stalking in a
01:17:56.480 minute and we'll get into the psychology of stalking in a minute. But as long as we're talking about risks, I want to bring up some real risks here. People
01:18:05.360 say, "Oh my gosh, why would she get a restraining order if this is just a cat fight among mean girls?
01:18:11.679 Nothing's going to happen. This is nothing, right?" No. Virtuous violence theory suggests otherwise. And
01:18:17.760 if you do, as I've done, if you do some of the stalking risk assessments, the
01:18:22.800 risks are considerable. And this is what he does is he assesses
01:18:27.840 and evaluates offenders. So this is what you do with your philosophy.
01:18:34.080 We know just kidding. Psychology. There's so many examples of when you
01:18:41.600 engage with people on a moral crusade and your goal is to dehumanize them
01:18:48.560 and you see it as a moral issue, it will escalate.
01:18:55.360 And that was a concern you and I had. If people say, "Oh my god, this stocking order is so frivolous. The stock." No,
01:19:02.080 it's not. And this is why. because you and I were trying to prevent
01:19:08.480 someone landing at our door with a gun. We did not we did not want to get to
01:19:13.679 that point. And somebody has now threatened us Yeah. with that online. Yes. Officially,
01:19:19.920 we we received our first official death threat the other day. Um
01:19:25.760 which again, not our first official actually. Not our Yeah, that's true. We've had others. That's true.
01:19:30.800 But it was very chilling. It was chilling and it it shows you the extent to which when you start framing things
01:19:36.719 in terms of this moral crusade, this is what you get.
01:19:45.600 What are some of the other risks risk? And we're going to define stalking in a second, but let's talk about some of the other risks involved here and why this
01:19:52.560 is why this is not just mean girl behavior. Number
01:19:58.239 one, the obsessive nature of the posts.
01:20:03.679 Everyone who's we talk about this all this all the time. The number of criminals that engage in murder or very
01:20:10.880 violent acts, almost all of them have some type of obsessive qualities. They
01:20:16.080 ruminate about the victim. They can't stop thinking about the victim. They
01:20:21.440 obsess over the victim. Right? that that that creates an attachment to the victim. Here you have that type of
01:20:27.760 obsession. Another risk here, months and months and months of posts
01:20:33.520 despite not communicating. Well, despite you saying you feel threatened.
01:20:38.560 Yeah. Starting it with I feel threatened then the the social media, the Instagram to Instagram and Tik Tok and there's a
01:20:45.120 YouTube I didn't know actually until after this in um months and months and months and months of it without any
01:20:50.800 response from me. escalating
01:20:55.840 obsessive. There's also this this inordinate rage
01:21:01.040 and hatred towards you
01:21:06.880 and that's a risk because when people when people develop this intense rage
01:21:13.360 towards another human being and I think by the way uh with the Tik Tocker I
01:21:19.600 think a lot of that is repressed but you see it the way the way you see
01:21:25.199 that rage is by ignoring a stalking injunction.
01:21:30.400 Right? The way you see that rage come out is by being oppositional. It's after our first hearing. It's going
01:21:36.400 outside on the courtroom steps and doing a mic drop. That's taunting you.
01:21:42.159 The stalker did that on the day of our hearing in September. She went outside.
01:21:47.360 She filmed herself doing a mic drop. That's harassment. What was supposed to it it was supposed
01:21:53.600 to be our evidentiary hearing and the judge changed it to a later date and
01:21:59.440 the judge continued it and lessened the stalking injunction and
01:22:05.679 she went out and did a mic drop against Utah code. By the way, Utah code
01:22:10.800 specifies quite clearly that you can't modify a stalking injunction without hearing evidence
01:22:16.560 from from from the petitioner. And that's what happened from Lauren. And the the injunction was
01:22:22.639 modified without hearing from you without hearing a shred of evidence from
01:22:27.760 us. Also, just for the just so people know this, our lawyer tried to get the stalking
01:22:34.400 injunction enforced. My lawyer who's not my brother, PS, go ahead. The our lawyer Daston, not her brother.
01:22:42.000 Our our lawyer who one of four. Yeah. One of Right. We We have other lawyers, too. None of our
01:22:48.320 are my brother. Yeah. So, whatever. at the rumor mill. Um,
01:22:55.840 our lawyer tried to argue correctly that because there were multiple
01:23:01.600 violations of a stalking injunction, which is a felony that the stalking injunction get should get automatically
01:23:07.920 enforced. Guess what the and that is Utah code. That is if you violate it twice. Our lawyer made the point that that
01:23:14.159 hearing never should have even occurred. It shouldn't have even been an issue. It's black and white. Someone violated a
01:23:20.800 stalking injunction. It gets enforced. It should have been enforced. End of story. Let's move on. You and I have our
01:23:27.920 privacy intact. That's all we wanted. We wanted this to be private. We wanted to move on with
01:23:34.960 our lives without someone harassing us all the time, bullying us, stalking us, calling, we'll get into that later,
01:23:41.520 calling people, contacting people. That's that's all we wanted.
01:23:46.800 this argument that somehow we wanted views from long
01:23:52.960 crime or that we set this up. That's so ridiculous. Lauren, I'm not going to read it again.
01:23:59.280 Lauren read a motion that our lawyer wrote to protect our
01:24:04.800 privacy. Almost no civil stalking cases reveal or disclose the p the
01:24:12.639 information. Well, and the reason many people have asked that fairly and you know what, let's not even get into I
01:24:18.800 don't want to talk about it. Let the rumor mill continue. You guys decide what you think about what I did.
01:24:26.080 That's that's your right to discuss. Go ahead.
01:24:32.719 So, you have this obsessive behavior that increases risk. you have this inordinate amount of anger and rage
01:24:39.920 towards you which shows up in those Tik Toks and those social media. And another
01:24:45.440 thing that people have pointed out that I totally agree with is several people that have looked at the Tik Tok have written and said, one person wrote,
01:24:51.920 "That's the most menacing. Those are the most menacing Tik Toks I've ever seen." Somebody else wrote,
01:24:58.719 "It seems like she's taking pleasure in those." Right? That suggests
01:25:06.159 that there's, if that's true, that suggests that there's a sadistic quality
01:25:11.199 that this is someone taking pleasure in harming you, taking pleasure in hurting
01:25:16.639 you, taking pleasure in trying to ruin your character and your reputation and
01:25:21.679 your livelihood and your life, right? That's a risk factor. Anyone who
01:25:27.440 has statistic qualities
01:25:32.560 is going to be a higher risk. Another risk factor here is
01:25:39.440 this very oppositional let's call it antisocial quality
01:25:48.800 which is violating a stalking injunction in the first several hours after it's issued. Right?
01:25:55.600 That's that's basically saying I don't care if you if you see the picture of
01:26:01.840 her in the bar with you. The message she's sending is I don't not
01:26:08.239 only do I not care about the stalking injunction, but I'm going to intimidate you. That is a pure message of power and
01:26:17.679 control and dominance and intimidation. She's saying, "I'm here. I don't care
01:26:23.840 about this injunction. I am going to continue to intimidate and control you
01:26:28.960 no matter what. Try and stop me. That's concerning.
01:26:35.280 The mic drop moment I just me mentioned recording the police officer
01:26:41.679 recording the police officer calling after somebody that was called by police implicated her and so he
01:26:48.239 decided to call her too and that she called him back to record it.
01:26:54.719 Right. Recording the police officer, posting it online and essentially not taking the police
01:27:01.280 officer seriously. That's extremely oppositional. That's very antisocial.
01:27:06.800 That's a very antisocial feature. Posting that um I feel threatened in a
01:27:13.360 message to her and then posting that online. And all of this,
01:27:19.360 all of this, by the way, so we're talking about risk factors. Yeah, let's just talk. We're talking risk factors, right?
01:27:26.560 All of these are risk factors, but they all lead to one thing, and that is dehumanization.
01:27:33.840 What they're doing here is they're portraying you as evil, as the devil, even though Pinñata Samurai doesn't mind
01:27:41.040 if you're the devil. By the way, thank you, Pinñata Samurai, for acknowledging that apparently even the devil does
01:27:48.320 really good work. Um, the devil does do good work, but I will do my best to not be like the devil.
01:27:57.920 All of this leads to dehumanization. And you and I know every crime we've ever covered is is involves some level of
01:28:04.159 dehumanization. Absolutely. That is crime. Dehumanization. And all of this is about dehumanizing
01:28:09.520 you. Even the the people that are mocking you, the memes, it's all dehumanizing, right? But they don't
01:28:15.280 care, right? So, which is fine. Which is fine.
01:28:23.040 I've been giving people some good content. A 9h hour live would do that.
01:28:30.719 So, so I think we've come to the end of this
01:28:36.480 segment. Okay. I've covered why I think this is a risk.
01:28:42.560 I've covered why it shouldn't be dismissed and taken seriously. It's v virtuous violence.
01:28:48.960 It's a moral crusade, right? I've covered um some of the risk factors. But let's
01:28:56.159 let's back up a little bit and talk about both the definition of stalking
01:29:01.440 and the psychology of stalking because I think those are going to help us go a little deeper here. Okay.
01:29:06.880 But before I do, I just want to make the final point that the reason why human beings like to
01:29:13.840 engage in moral crusades is because it really simplifies the world.
01:29:19.679 Does and it also fosters conformity. So for those of you out there who know a little
01:29:26.480 bit about philosophy, if any of you have read Nichi on good and evil, you
01:29:31.760 understand the importance of Nichi's idea that all morality is essentially an attempt
01:29:38.239 to foster and maintain
01:29:44.080 social norms and social moral systems because the prevailing ruling classes do
01:29:50.719 not want challenges or change.
01:29:56.480 And by enforcing an existing system of morality, you're also making the world fit into a
01:30:03.600 very narrow box. Right? And so that's one of the problems of a moral crusade
01:30:10.000 is that if you don't fit within that box, then you're going to be vilified,
01:30:15.520 right? And so you became vilified as we as we talked about in our Patreon
01:30:23.679 in the one of the declarations
01:30:32.239 the the the the tick tocker made it very clear that conformity was a big part of
01:30:37.679 this issue. Yeah. Yeah. That was actually uh in their declaration and sort of the
01:30:47.120 little joke that I made on our Patreon exclusive episode which is no longer Patreon exclusive. Thanks for those who
01:30:54.719 picked it apart and shared it. But uh yeah, in their declaration their their
01:30:59.840 angst against me or one of the things that upset me was that I talked about how I don't like to conform. And then I
01:31:05.760 jokingly said, "Thanks for being a Patreon supporter." because that particular episode was behind a payw
01:31:11.520 wall. Uh which meant that they were someone was paying and sending that on to them. Uh but it was ironic because
01:31:17.840 you have always talked about the fact that one reason
01:31:23.360 um this type of thing happens is because they're upset that I'm not conforming. I
01:31:29.920 gave a classic I talked about the classic example of the Salem witch trials from 1692
01:31:36.719 where obviously witches are seen as an abomination.
01:31:42.560 They're seen as demonic, right? They're seen as
01:31:49.360 separate from the community, not conforming to the community's morals, right? So, in many ways, the Salem witch
01:31:56.800 trials were exactly or they showed similarities to a moral
01:32:03.120 crusade. And we'll talk about that a little later. We won't get into that too much, but so I wanted I want to make
01:32:09.600 that point before we move on because I I want people to understand the purpose
01:32:14.880 of a moral crusade and what it does, how it fosters conformity or attempts to and how it really oversimplifies the world
01:32:22.239 so that people that people that they don't have to grasp with the, you know, they don't have to grapple with the
01:32:29.199 complexity of someone who's maybe a little more complex, somebody who can say some off-color things in private
01:32:35.840 messages, someone who has a sarcastic sense of humor. You do. I do.
01:32:44.320 Obviously, it got you in a little bit of trouble on Patreon, but you didn't do anything wrong. Like, part of our brand
01:32:50.639 is to bring in levity. You can't clip a part of that segment and say, "Oh my god, she's not serious
01:32:57.120 about stalking duping delight or duper delight." So stupid. So stupid.
01:33:02.560 If you don't laugh, you cry sometimes. So yeah, thank you. Everybody in this, everybody that deals
01:33:08.800 with true crime and law enforcement, um, investigators, they know how difficult
01:33:16.400 it is. They know the importance of humor. Part of our brand is to be humorous.
01:33:26.000 So let's talk about the definition of stalking. Part of my survival depends on being
01:33:31.120 humorous. It's how I cope, right? But hey, you know, let's vilify
01:33:36.239 you for that. Let's let's continue the moral crusade train and just keep piling
01:33:41.760 on because you showed a little bit of humor. Um,
01:33:49.840 I like let me start with so let's let's let's
01:33:55.679 start defining stalking. So, one of my favorite definitions actually comes out of the UK. So that in the UK there's
01:34:03.679 some local police agencies and um
01:34:09.520 social workers and people that kind of deal with stalking um that often refer to what they call
01:34:16.960 the big four. And when I say the big four, I mean four as in capital F, capital O, capital U, capital R.
01:34:26.159 And so, and I know this is the UK and not here, but the big four stands for
01:34:35.760 F. Yeah. What was that one? Fixated. Fixated. F means fixated.
01:34:41.840 Fixated. Is this it? So, let's go through this. Is is there fixation here? So, yes, there is. There there are
01:34:47.440 social media accounts that specifically target you. That's part of the definition of
01:34:52.639 stalking is there has to be some type of individual target. Guess what? Every one
01:34:57.920 of these social media accounts is fixated on you. Fixation. Yes. O.
01:35:04.880 The O stands for obsessed. Is there obsession here? There's 50 plus
01:35:10.480 or more. Way more if you count all the social media accounts. There's over 100. There's there's over a hundred
01:35:16.800 posts that showed no signs of stopping or abating all about you. Is that
01:35:25.040 obsessive? Absolutely. And Lindsay did admit on the stand during that hearing that they never
01:35:31.040 heard from me that she admitted it was about you. She admitted it was about me. You were the target.
01:35:36.400 So we have fixated, obsessed. The U stands for unwanted.
01:35:44.400 you in a email and in a text you said, "I feel threatened. Please leave me
01:35:49.679 alone." In both a text and an email. Email. Did that stop it?
01:35:54.960 No. Nope. Actually, it escalated from there. Everything that was being sent to you,
01:36:00.560 you said, "Please don't do this." And the person continued. Not only continued, but escalated.
01:36:08.639 The R stands for repeated. I think that's obviously a no-brainer. Was this
01:36:14.320 behavior repeated? Obviously, over and over and over. So, the definition of
01:36:19.440 stalking, the the most simplistic criteria for stalking are fixated, obsessed,
01:36:25.120 unwanted, unwanted, repeated. Yep. Check, check, check, check, check.
01:36:31.840 Here's how on one of the websites that talks about the big four define stalking. Stalking.
01:36:37.520 And this is stalking. This is physical or cyber. This is both, right? quote, this is from a website in the UK.
01:36:44.719 Stalking is a pattern of unwanted repeated behavior that can leave you feeling scared or distressed.
01:36:53.760 You don't have to be threatened with violence to be a victim of stalking. Any kind of persistent unwanted contact that
01:37:02.480 causes distress is stalking.
01:37:07.760 Do you fit that definition? Yes.
01:37:15.600 Let's talk about again this is from the same UK
01:37:20.639 website. I'm also pointing out that this is not just this the the definition of
01:37:25.840 stalking and cyberstalking we're talking about. This is all over the world. This
01:37:30.880 doesn't just apply here. This is in Australia. This is in the UK, right?
01:37:40.239 To identify stalking, they talk about this what they call the SLI, double eye
01:37:45.600 strategy. To identify stalking, professionals often use the SLI
01:37:51.600 strategy. What's the first S? Surveillance. Stalkers often engage in surveillance,
01:37:57.840 closely watching and tracking their victim's movements, routines, and social interactions.
01:38:04.719 This includes monitoring their social media. The goal is to gather personal
01:38:10.400 information and maintain a sense of control over the victim. And let's talk about recording when at
01:38:16.960 trials or crime con. Interestingly enough,
01:38:22.000 one of the people who wrote a declaration for the stalker, Janice,
01:38:27.679 admitted to filming us multiple times and then even showed an evidence
01:38:33.760 her filming both my producer Grayson and myself um even at Crime Con after the
01:38:41.600 stalking injunction was um was put out and actually put those
01:38:46.880 videos that she unknowingly took of into evidence.
01:38:54.000 But there's there's other ways that you're being the surveillance applies here. Correct. That they're following your Patreon. They're following John when you
01:39:00.560 did a Mormon stories. She lets you know that she's watching that. She's following everything you're posting, everything you're doing, every
01:39:06.400 social media post. She's recording you without your consent.
01:39:11.520 She is she's she's clearly and she's doing this to gather personal
01:39:18.239 information to harm you. She even admits, "I'm looking for their LinkedIn because I want to see who
01:39:24.080 they're linked to. Isn't it strange they don't have it? I'm going to call UNLV. I did call UNLV. Uh we know other
01:39:32.639 people that they have contacted. Thank you to those who have reached out." So, surveillance. Number two, life invasion.
01:39:40.719 The tactic involves invading the victim's personal life or space. It can be as subtle as sending frequent
01:39:47.440 unsolicited messages, including on social media. Are we see are you
01:39:52.560 receiving frequent unsolicited messages? Absolutely. The third third one is the
01:39:57.679 the eye part. Intimidation. Stalkers often use intimidation to instill fear. How about
01:40:04.639 showing up at Crime Con when the stalking injunction said she couldn't and then showing up in the bar 10 ft
01:40:11.760 from you, taunting people, taunting the police who had
01:40:16.960 issued this injunction within hours, showing up at the bar, basically saying to you, "I don't care.
01:40:24.560 I'm in control. I'm going to intimidate. I don't care about this injunction. I own you."
01:40:29.920 Right? It's intimidation. The nature of intimidation is
01:40:37.440 threatening messages, aggressive behavior, or implying harm.
01:40:43.760 Implying harm. So, it can be something as simple as implying harm. Is there implicit threats and implicit harm
01:40:50.320 throughout this? Absolutely. How about ruining your kingdom, burning your kingdom to the ground? Is that harm?
01:40:57.119 Yeah. It also can include reputational harm.
01:41:02.159 The final one is interference. The stalker
01:41:08.800 is involved in deliberately interfering with the victim's life.
01:41:14.639 Examples include damaging someone's reputation or trying to sabotage their
01:41:19.760 personal or professional relationships. The goal is to isolate the victim and
01:41:26.639 make them feel powerless or dependent.
01:41:32.480 That happened, right? Exactly. You You meet all of
01:41:37.760 those criteria.
01:41:43.840 I'm going to read I'm going to read. Let's talk specifically about cyberstalking. Now,
01:41:53.520 this is from the textbook. This is my favorite textbook on criminal psychology, by the way. Criminal
01:41:59.360 Behavior, a psychological pros, 12th edition. It's by Kurt Barl and Anne Barl. Page 521.
01:42:07.199 Their definition of cyberstalking is using the internet or other forms of electronic communication to threaten
01:42:14.800 or engage in unwanted advances towards another. Pretty simple, right?
01:42:21.040 Were you threatened? Yes. Was it was it unwanted um advances? Absolutely.
01:42:32.639 Let's talk about cyber bullying. This is how they define cyber bullying.
01:42:38.480 Quote, "Cyber bullying is defined as sending or posting harmful or cruel text
01:42:44.000 or images using the internet or other digital communication devices.
01:42:50.480 was saying that you engaged in non-consensual that you desired
01:42:56.880 to engage in non-consensual relations with your brother to obtain his sperm.
01:43:02.320 Was that a cruel message? Yeah, that's cyber bullying.
01:43:09.920 I'm going to I'm just going to say quickly what this is also ultimately this is what Bartto and Bartal say about
01:43:15.760 cyberstalking. quote, "Ultimately, much cyberstalking is designed to control the victim,
01:43:22.080 usually through threats and harassment. So, a large part of this is about
01:43:27.920 control.
01:43:36.159 Here's another definition
01:43:41.760 of cyber bullying. This is from a research article.
01:43:49.360 Quote, "Building upon this, the definition of traditional bullying,
01:43:55.679 the authors have defined cyber bullying as quote, "an aggressive, intentional act carried out by a group or individual
01:44:04.880 using electronic forms of contact repeatedly and overtime against a victim who cannot easily defend him or herself.
01:44:18.000 Some might argue that you could defend yourself, except you can't. Really, you couldn't,
01:44:28.320 right? The reason you couldn't defend yourself is because our brand is not to engage in these types of petty
01:44:36.239 arguments or conflicts with other creators. Like, we're not going to do what he said, she said, or tit for tat.
01:44:41.360 That's not our brand. We couldn't defend ourselves without
01:44:46.639 looking like absolute fools. We couldn't defend ourselves because
01:44:53.440 people have the perception that because we're a bigger channel that somehow we would be bullying her. We didn't want to
01:45:00.639 defend ourselves because we didn't want to go public with this. We didn't want to defend ourselves because we thought
01:45:06.000 we could ignore it long enough that it would go away. But after months and months and months of continuing multiple
01:45:12.800 pulse and escalating, we realized to the point where law and crime was getting involved.
01:45:18.239 Yeah. We realized this got to the point where the risks were increasing and we just we we weren't willing to deal with
01:45:25.199 this forever and that is why we in the end we decided to get a stalking
01:45:30.400 injunction. Well, what I meant about long time is
01:45:36.159 even after that it still got bigger. It's, you know, how did they find out about it and long crime got involved and
01:45:43.840 then I decided to draw my Yeah. nourhal
01:45:54.159 definition of stalking in Nevada. So, I think is it fair to say that I mean I
01:45:59.600 guess our haters are going to disagree, but I think any any reasonable person would the criteria I just read would
01:46:06.000 would agree. I would hope or think that they would see that as stalking or at
01:46:11.280 least cyberstalking.
01:46:19.199 This is cyberstalking in Nevada. You put up, by the way, people can find
01:46:24.320 the definition of cyberstalking and stalking in Utah. You put it up. I don't want to reread that because we already
01:46:30.400 have it. Okay. Maybe we can put it up for people to see. Sure. But let's talk about Nevada. I don't
01:46:36.880 believe that a reasonable court would think that stalking is nothing more than
01:46:42.639 a cat fight or two mean girls going at it.
01:46:48.800 In Nevada, cyberstalking is considered a category C felony carrying a prison sentence of one
01:46:56.159 to five years and a fine of up to $10,000.
01:47:01.760 The following requirements must be met in Nevada for a cyberstalking. The accused person must intentionally cause
01:47:08.159 harm to the victim. Even if it's just trying to scare them or make them afraid. So intentional harm, that's a
01:47:16.159 big part of it. Obviously, there's a targeted social media account only about multiple targeted social
01:47:22.480 media accounts only about you. Did that induce a certain amount of fear
01:47:28.639 in you? Yes. Could you explain? Well,
01:47:34.159 physical well multiple I mean the song lyrics that she was posting were very frightening. Crying about what I lose.
01:47:41.280 What am I going to lose? Uh burning my kingdom to the
01:47:47.280 ground. uh her uh accompllices
01:47:53.119 con constantly egging her on and inciting this saying yes burn that kingdom to the ground calling workplaces
01:48:02.719 other people coming forward and saying I'm getting strange calls from this person saying you're bad not to work
01:48:08.000 with you um admitting to trying to find our LinkedIn months later being
01:48:14.000 suspicious posting and sharing that they're following everything I say,
01:48:19.280 putting eye emojis on podcast that I'm doing, saying, "I'm watching you."
01:48:25.360 Doing things besides saying, "Please stop. I'm feeling threatened." Posting that I'm feeling threatened.
01:48:31.679 Um, continually, you know, breaking a stalking injunction. Um,
01:48:37.920 yeah. And by the way, to all of those that egged her on, there was peer pressure in this. One of those
01:48:43.760 podcasters just claimed yesterday that they would have advised her against ever doing this
01:48:50.480 yet on her Instagram months ago put you go girl. So maybe all of you should be considering how you played a part in
01:48:57.040 this too. Keep in mind keep in mind that several of the definitions I just read about cyberstalking include groups. Let's
01:49:04.880 continue. Criteria two, Nevada for a category C felony for cyberstalking in Nevada.
01:49:11.679 Category two, the accused person must have electronic must have used electronic devices such as a computer or
01:49:18.639 phone to transmit information that puts the victim at the victim at risk of violence or harm.
01:49:26.239 Yep. Stalking must happen online or through some other electronic means. Criteria three. Criteria four. The
01:49:33.199 victim must feel fearful because of the accused person's actions. We just covered that.
01:49:54.159 The final criteria in Nevada is what's called the reasonable person standard.
01:49:59.360 The conduct must be such that a reasonable person in the same situation would also be afraid.
01:50:04.630 [Applause] That of course is not up to that would not be up to us to determine that would
01:50:10.159 be up to try the triers of fact which would be a judge or a jury.
01:50:15.760 Let's talk about
01:50:24.239 this is from this is from probably the best known textbook on stalking. The most the most well-
01:50:31.679 read and respected textbook on stalking. It's called Stalkers and Their Victims. It's by Mullen Pay and PCEL. It's the
01:50:40.239 second edition from 2009. It's published by Cambridge University Press. Stalkers
01:50:45.440 and their victims. Page 153.
01:50:51.760 The following behaviors characterize cyberstalking.
01:50:58.000 Number one, sending repeated unwanted messages.
01:51:04.239 Yeah. Right. Yeah. Via a public platform, right? So, well, through email, through text, I'm
01:51:10.080 feeling threatened and then through a public social media platform. Through social media.
01:51:16.320 Another criteria, publishing private information of a potentially damaging or embarrassing
01:51:22.800 nature. Again, I mentioned that publishing private information is illegal, but that too is cyberstalking.
01:51:30.239 So, anybody in this group who has published private information about you
01:51:36.480 publicly that's potentially damaging to your reputation is part of the smear campaign
01:51:44.080 and they're engaging in cyberstalking.
01:51:49.920 The next criteria, spreading false information. How many rumors,
01:51:56.159 how much gossip has been spread about you, that you you damage, you hurt
01:52:01.280 creators, that you don't care about victims, right? Like no matter what you say or
01:52:06.719 do, that rumor persists endlessly. And then in the smear campaign, you get,
01:52:14.880 "Wait for the receipts. Wait for the receipts." That too is a form of harassment.
01:52:21.119 That too is is a threat. When you wake up every day
01:52:26.800 to a social media campaign of multiple people constantly saying they're going
01:52:32.960 to take you down. And writing again my professional contact saying, "Oh, just wait for the
01:52:39.199 receipts. Just wait. They're coming."
01:52:45.280 So spreading false information. That's another criteria. Here's another criteria. Gathering information about a
01:52:51.520 victim online. That's called doxing. Did we get doxed? Oh, we got doxed. We
01:52:58.719 got so doxed. They were mad they had to work a little bit harder because we didn't have a LinkedIn, which is super sauce. It's
01:53:06.480 like saying you don't have a face if you don't have a Facebook. You know, is anything we're saying true?
01:53:14.719 So, doxing, by the way, that's classic harassment. In fact, doxing is defined as harassment.
01:53:21.520 Were we doxed? Yes, I was doxed. You were doxed. You know, I guess there was some good news that came out of it
01:53:26.880 because she said, the Tik Tocker said
01:53:32.480 that she believed there was so little information on us because we curated our accounts. We have curated
01:53:39.520 curated our Google search results. We've curated nothing. Curated a dang thing. I don't even I
01:53:44.880 don't even know how we I would cure. I don't know how to curate. I mean, maybe we should get somebody to do that. We could.
01:53:52.000 And here is the last cyberstalking behavior that's that's
01:53:57.840 that defines cyberstalking. Ready for this one? Encouraging others to harass the victim.
01:54:09.360 There's a lot of that and a lot of that publicly. [Music]
01:54:15.199 Exactly. Do we fit these criteria? Do we fit these definitions?
01:54:23.599 All right. So, I'm going to stay with I'm going to stay with the textbook stalkers and their victims, second
01:54:29.040 edition. I'm going to use some of their definitions.
01:54:38.639 Page two, defining stalking. And again, this isn't cyberstalking. This is I'm defining stalking here broadly speaking
01:54:50.639 or they don't even call it stalking. They call it obsessional following.
01:54:57.040 This is how they define obsessional following. Ready? Quote.
01:55:02.080 An abnormal or long-term pattern of threat or harassment directed towards a specific individual.
01:55:09.040 Yep. Here the authors, here's how the authors define it. Stalking is quote a
01:55:16.080 constellation of behaviors in which one individual inflicts on another repeated unwanted intrusions and communications.
01:55:25.520 Yep. [Music] So, I've read a lot of definitions of
01:55:32.480 stalking. I've read definitions of cyberstalking. Do they fit?
01:55:39.440 Yes. Yet, of course, there's plenty of people apparently out there who argue that this
01:55:46.320 wasn't stalking, this was catfighting, this was real housewife stuff, whatever. There was no harm involved. I would urge
01:55:54.080 them to go look at the legal and academic definitions as I just defined
01:56:00.480 of stalking because stalking, one of the interesting
01:56:06.480 things out there in terms of listening to some of this debate about what stalking is
01:56:11.920 is that almost all the people who would disagree with the academic criteria that
01:56:17.440 I'm reading and the and the legal criteria, they see stalking as like a 1930s phenomenon.
01:56:23.599 where you follow someone around in your old Ford, I don't know, 1930s cars, your
01:56:29.040 whatever, your old Ford Gilapy with a gun, right? That they think stalking is
01:56:34.719 physically following someone around with a gun, right? Guess what? It's not.
01:56:40.960 We live in 2025. Stalking is
01:56:47.119 fixated obsessional behavior that's unwanted and repeated that causes
01:56:52.719 distress in the victim. That's precisely what's going on with you. So this this
01:56:59.119 idea that there's a team Lauren and a team I mean people can believe
01:57:05.040 whatever they want but like this idea of teams is absurd. If you look at the
01:57:12.159 criteria for stalking, how it's defined legally and
01:57:17.199 academically, there's two teams. There's team
01:57:25.119 Lauren, who fits all the criteria of stalking and cyberstalking, every one of
01:57:30.639 them. And then there's the stalking team who doesn't fit the who who meets all the
01:57:37.520 criteria of someone who's stalking. I don't know. I mean, have we litigated
01:57:43.520 that in court yet? Nope. But I feel very confident that if and when we do,
01:57:50.800 if we reup this case and litigate it in another state that's not Provo, Utah,
01:58:01.040 that we're going to show quite clearly that you meet the criteria for stalking and that you need protection.
01:58:08.239 And to the media who thinks that filming civil stalking injunctions is okay. By
01:58:15.840 the way, I hope that you can reconsider that position and wonder if this is
01:58:20.880 maybe why people that are being abused can't escape their abusers or that it
01:58:26.080 might be used as an abuser's way of coercive control if they're encouraging media to cover a civil stalking
01:58:32.239 injunction. Well, and on that point, by the way, we
01:58:38.080 fought vigorously for privacy. We did vigorously. The same county, by the way, where
01:58:44.159 Charlie Kirk was assassinated, I might add, by someone uh who was incited by
01:58:50.480 online rhetoric and violence. The same
01:58:55.599 county where someone lost their lives because
01:59:00.800 of online rhetoric. You said did you said lives did Charlie
01:59:06.800 clerk clerk have multip their life? Okay, there you go. Yeah.
01:59:11.920 On that note, when you talk about privacy, let's remind everybody that you guys
01:59:17.760 could have gone public four months ago. Yeah. We could have sent masses to this
01:59:26.320 woman's account four months ago. And why didn't we? Because we said it's okay.
01:59:31.760 we'll handle it. Let's just be private about it. We don't want anybody to know. Nobody knew about it for months because
01:59:38.960 we continued to just try and be quiet until we felt like we had no other option.
01:59:44.400 So Grayson is over here saying, "Let's remind people that we could have gone forward in public four months ago and
01:59:50.719 taken this into our hands and sent everybody over to her account and taken care of this four months ago,
01:59:57.599 but we didn't because we wanted this to remain private. And we didn't want
02:00:02.639 people going over to her account to harass her or attack her. We could have
02:00:10.320 gone forward come forward four months ago is what you're saying. Yeah. And I'm also somebody reached out
02:00:16.639 to me who knows this person and they were they just wanted to let me know that they had been contacted and I told
02:00:23.679 them I find myself having a lot of empathy for her right now regardless of what she's done because I
02:00:31.119 see the hate that she's getting and I would never want somebody to feel that way and I would never want somebody to
02:00:37.040 consider maybe doing something to themselves or maybe you know like I
02:00:42.639 actually don't believe Sorry. I don't think that
02:00:48.080 the way you get somebody to have remorse and to change their behavior is by
02:00:54.080 screaming at them. Yeah. I actually feel like that incites anger and that makes them more vengeful. And
02:00:59.520 so I find myself having a lot of hurt people. It Yeah, it can hurt people. It can incite Look at the death threat we got
02:01:05.520 online with somebody loading a gun and quite literally shooting it, saying, "If you come to my state, guess what I'm
02:01:11.199 going to do?" But so I don't believe in that. And I was telling this person who reached out
02:01:17.360 who had a relationship with um this person this person the Tik Tocker
02:01:22.960 and just wanted to give me some information. I said, "Thank you for the information." And I literally sent back a message and said, "I find myself
02:01:29.440 having a lot of empathy." And although I'm really struggling right now, it's no secret I am. I've been public about it.
02:01:36.159 Haven't been public about the specifics. I find myself having a lot of empathy
02:01:41.360 because I wonder if she's maybe in a similar boat that I've been in for the last quite the last while. And I never
02:01:50.800 want somebody to feel that way. And again, I don't think that going to her account and screaming at her and telling
02:01:57.440 her she's wrong. If you want someone to change, that's not the way to get them to change. That actually makes them
02:02:03.840 worse. The best way you can appeal to somebody's empathy and the appeal to their
02:02:10.480 conscience really, if they have one, is by having one yourself
02:02:16.000 and trying to do it reasonably. Now, is this person reasonable? I wouldn't necessarily say so, but I would say that
02:02:22.639 like again, just going crazy on her on social media is not going to do anything.
02:02:30.880 Well, yeah. And to the people that egged her on, that's my point, too. the peer pressure to every one of those
02:02:36.880 commenters egging her on and continuing to tell her to do this. You also,
02:02:42.239 you know, hold some responsibility. [Music]
02:02:47.920 That's mobbing. It's group bullying. And you didn't help her either.
02:02:55.840 So, I've gone through the criteria for stalking both legal and academic
02:03:02.080 definitions. To me, it seems pretty clear-cut that you meet those criteria.
02:03:08.800 Let's move on to different types of stalkers. So, I'm
02:03:14.480 going to refer to the same textbook, Stalkers and their victims, second edition, published in 2009.
02:03:26.880 There are two different typologies of there. There's actually multiple typologies. There's like four typologies
02:03:32.719 of stalkers that they identify, four or five, but I only want to focus on the ones
02:03:38.400 that apply here. So, they actually lump them together because there's a lot of overlap, but they refer to this type of
02:03:46.320 stalking as the rejected stalker and the resentful stalker. So, what is the rejected stalker? The rejected stalker
02:03:53.840 is uh the re rejected stalker occurs as a consequence of the breakdown of a close
02:04:00.400 relationship. So in other words with you you had a friendship with the person or perceived
02:04:05.920 friendship for you it was much of a paras more of a parasocial relationship rather than a close relationship but
02:04:12.800 that's not how she perceived it. You have the breakdown of a relationship.
02:04:18.800 You have the desire to exact revenge for the ree rejection. And then you ready for this? The
02:04:24.960 stalking substitutes for the lost intimacy of the friendship by creating the
02:04:31.360 semblance of closeness that's now gone.
02:04:39.520 I'm just going to read a little bit from the text about rejected stalkers because they're going to explain it better than me. Mhm.
02:04:47.440 Page 69 in the rejected stalker in the the the Mullen textbook.
02:04:53.920 Quote, "The rejected can be among the most persistent and intrusive the stalkers. Once established, their
02:05:00.560 pattern of harassment is very difficult to alter. It's not always immediately
02:05:06.000 obvious why these men and women continue so tenaciously to pursue their victim.
02:05:14.320 Further down the page, quote, "For those stalkers who cannot abandon the hope of restoring the relationship, the
02:05:20.719 harassment at least provides some semblance of connectedness to the lost friend.
02:05:28.560 For the rejected stalker who is predominantly angry and vengeful, the stalking seems aimed in part at
02:05:35.599 continuing a relationship in which for all their raging they remain imshed.
02:05:41.840 The stalking in a sense is a continuation of a relationship, the loss of which is too threatening or which
02:05:49.360 they remain bound by unresolved emotions and desires made all the more compelling by their ambivalent nature.
02:05:57.119 So in other words, for the rejected stalker, a part of the stalking is to maintain the sense of connection and
02:06:03.280 closeness with the victim. You
02:06:12.320 Let's talk about some of the psychopathology behind rejected stalkers.
02:06:21.520 According to the research, quote, this type the rejected this type of stalker had high rates of personality
02:06:28.400 problems with antisocial and narcissistic traits being particularly
02:06:33.760 prominent. There was also a small but significant
02:06:39.360 cluster with market dependency traits.
02:06:48.079 So those are rejected stalkers. Let's move on to what they call the resentful stalker. So the rejected stalker part of
02:06:54.079 this is the rejection of your friendship. Okay, let's talk about the resentful stalker.
02:07:00.719 Okay. The resentful stalker emerge quote emerges where the stalker feels that they have been exposed to an injustice
02:07:06.960 or humiliation. That was you calling her annoying in a private text.
02:07:12.000 Yeah. So, she is both a rejected and a resentful stalker.
02:07:19.040 The victim of the resentful stalker is someone who has attracted the stalker's enmity
02:07:26.000 by their own actions or by seeing as representative of an
02:07:31.520 oppressing group. The desire is for revenge, sometimes of a surreptitious
02:07:36.960 nature. The sustaining motivation of the resentful stalker is satisfying the
02:07:43.119 sense of power and control that comes from harassing the victim.
02:07:50.079 The resentful stalker almost invariably feels justified in their actions. That's the moral part. And presents themselves
02:07:57.440 as a victim fighting back against a more powerful oppressor.
02:08:03.199 That, by the way, is a narrative that many people have picked up on because you're the big creator.
02:08:09.040 Yeah. She must be the victim. Right. Right. That's that's a common theme that
02:08:14.079 seems to be out there that somehow you're harassing her because by doing this because she's the poor victim,
02:08:20.800 right? That's what's resentful. She's not a creator. She's just a person that is a tourist of trials and I um
02:08:30.400 I'm the big podcaster.
02:08:35.760 Let's let's talk let's dig a little bit deeper into the resentful stalker. Here
02:08:41.520 are some clinical features of the resentful stalker. Again, I'm reading from the textbook stalkers and their victims, second edition. This is page
02:08:48.079 76. Quote, "A context of conflict in which one party experiences themselves
02:08:54.000 as a victim of injustice can give rise to stalking. This type of stalking is initially
02:08:59.920 motivated by the desire for retribution. The stalking is designed to frighten and
02:09:05.360 distress the victim. The stalking becomes persistent because
02:09:11.280 of the satisfactions the stalker obtains from the sense of power and control over
02:09:16.800 someone who is in most cases has been previously regarded as being in a
02:09:22.320 stronger and more privileged position.
02:09:29.599 In keeping with the stalker's perception of their victim as being more powerful,
02:09:35.520 the more extended episodes of resentful stalking will often be pursued anonymous anonymous anonymously, at least
02:09:42.079 initially. When this type of stalker is interviewed, they almost invariably
02:09:48.000 present themselves not as an inventor, but as a victim who in the process of defending themselves is striking back at
02:09:55.280 the oppressor. So, in other words, it's a moral crusade. And she does this. She'll say, "I'm just
02:10:01.520 here. This isn't gossip. I'm just I'm just trying to deal with the big bad
02:10:06.880 wolf that's Yeah. I'm just trying to show present patterns she's had for so long." Let's talk about psychopathology of the
02:10:14.400 resentful stalker. Page 77. Quote, "The pattern which emerged from personality testing
02:10:20.880 suggested self-centered, immature individuals who are hostile, demanding
02:10:26.560 and argumentative. They overestimate themselves and they derrogate others. That means they put
02:10:32.880 others down. Defensiveness and denial is rampant in this group. They tend to have
02:10:38.000 poor frustration tolerance with high suppressed anger.
02:10:43.040 Check. Check. Check. Check. Yeah.
02:10:49.040 Well, let me say let me say on that issue like I don't know, you know, do I know for sure that she that she fits
02:10:56.400 this category? No, I don't. Like uh it just looking at her behaviors, it
02:11:01.920 seems like she fits some of this, but uh I'm not diagnosing here,
02:11:08.320 right? I'm just reading from a textbook research. I'm citing the research, right? I'm not
02:11:15.440 saying necessarily that she fits this. I think people can make that decision on their own. Let's go on.
02:11:25.679 Page 77, next paragraph. quote, "Resentful stalkers as a group showed a
02:11:31.840 market tendency to consciously attempt to present themselves in a socially desirable light.
02:11:37.840 Perhaps fitting with our view that these people attempt to project themselves as good victims
02:11:44.639 battling the forces of evil."
02:11:51.280 Let me repeat that because it fits everything we talked about earlier. Resentful
02:11:57.119 stalkers fit the they they they fit with the view that they attempt to
02:12:04.880 project themselves as good victims battling the forces of evil. That's
02:12:11.440 exactly how this is framed. That's exactly how most smear came smear
02:12:17.920 campaigns are framed.
02:12:23.599 The results of MMPI studies in 24 resentful stalkers supported the notion
02:12:28.639 that these people regard themselves as misunderstood, mistreated with low frustration
02:12:34.480 tolerance and difficulty with authority figures.
02:12:40.719 Difficulty with authority figures. So, taunting police, doing mic drops
02:12:46.239 outside of courouses, violating stalking injunctions within
02:12:51.920 hours after they're served by police, telling the stalker, "You cannot go
02:12:57.280 within 500 ft of your victim, no matter what."
02:13:08.639 Those are some of the definitions. So, I I've talked about the the definitions of stalking. I've talked about the types of
02:13:13.920 stalking. Now, let's talk about victim impact. Actually, before I get to victim impact,
02:13:20.639 let me talk a little bit about let's talk more about actually qualities
02:13:26.719 of cyber bullies. So, specifically about cyber bullies. There isn't a lot of research on adult cyber
02:13:33.520 bullies, by the way, but there's not. There's some interesting research. This is from a a research article entitled
02:13:40.320 systematic review of empirical studies on cyber bullying in adults. What we know and what we should investigate.
02:13:47.520 This is by Jaro at all in the journal aggression and violent behavior. This is
02:13:53.440 2018 so reasonably recent volume 28. This is on page
02:14:01.040 118. Here are some of the
02:14:06.560 qualities of cyber bullies.
02:14:12.800 Quote, "In a cyber bullying situation, not only the victims are affected,
02:14:19.040 several studies found that cyber bullies exhibit more psychological symptoms, including depression."
02:14:26.880 So that's interesting, right? They could be more depressed than Yeah. Yeah. So they experience depression.
02:14:34.480 They have more unemotional, impulsive, and psychopathic traits.
02:14:41.119 They're high sensation seekers, and they sometimes engage in violent and
02:14:46.639 drug crimes. The most interesting part of this to me is the depression that they're
02:14:51.920 unemotional, they're impulsive, and lo and behold, cyber bullies tend to have psychopathic
02:14:58.880 traits, which means that they defy or oppose authority figures.
02:15:04.719 quote, "They also scored high on internet use, showed a lack of social skills, problematic alcohol use, and not
02:15:14.079 surprisingly, low empathy towards their cyber bullying victims.
02:15:20.400 So, cyber bullies are unemotional, they lack empathy, they're impulsive, they have psychopathic traits,
02:15:27.599 they may have some depression.
02:15:40.320 Let's talk about impact.
02:15:47.920 How does cyber bullying impact its victims?
02:15:53.679 This is an extraordinary This is an extra This is an
02:15:59.440 extraordinary study. Just have to say for all those people saying bring the receipts, Dr. John's
02:16:05.280 bringing the research receipts. I'm bringing the research receipts. Right. You brought the actual receipts. I'm bringing the research receipts.
02:16:12.639 This is from a well-known article in the American Psychologist. The American Psychologist, by the way, is one of the
02:16:17.760 premier journals for psychologists. It's from 2017, volume 72. It's
02:16:24.079 Underwood and Aaron Reich.
02:16:29.119 It's called The Power and Pain of Adolescences, Digital Communications, Cyber Victimizations, and the Pearls of
02:16:34.959 Lurking. Okay,
02:16:47.040 admittedly, I'm going to frame this by saying admittedly this is pertaining to adolescence, okay? But
02:16:55.599 I'm sure this has application to adults. Sure it does. Relying on surveys about the frequency
02:17:02.879 of cyberstalking may keep us from understanding that although cyber aggression may be an
02:17:09.920 extremely low base rate event, so even among adolescence,
02:17:15.120 cyberstalking and cyber aggression is fairly low. That's good news, right? Okay,
02:17:22.718 let me keep let me let me since I stopped in the middle of that, I'll go again.
02:17:29.120 Although cyber aggression may be an extremely low base event, it hurts terribly even if it only happens once.
02:17:40.240 This is according to their survey. The impact of even a single episode
02:17:48.478 is potentially extremely serious because the behavior is immediately viewed by
02:17:53.840 hundreds of friends and followers and is preserved forever in digital form. I
02:18:00.959 can't tell you how much that impacted you and they're proving it. Well, one
02:18:06.080 reason we chose to not say this person's name and to blur
02:18:12.240 her and the Tik Toks, which we didn't need to do, we didn't
02:18:18.400 was because of that understanding. We're not going to do that. Correct.
02:18:26.320 But this research, she appeared publicly. She wanted everyone to find her. She was working on algorithms. She admits that on the Tik
02:18:32.160 Tok. Come join me. Send the word. spread the word. Here we are. And we still
02:18:38.478 didn't do that because we understand that what that means. We didn't want to do that. We went through it. We went through it.
02:18:45.519 But I mean, like, this is extraordinary because I when people mock you
02:18:52.718 about whether this is cyber bullying, when people say team, you know, team
02:18:58.400 Laurens's a joke. I don't know what they're saying. I don't care. But the point like this data, this research that
02:19:04.799 shows I'm going to read it again because it's so the impact of even a single episode
02:19:10.160 is potentially extremely serious because the behavior is immediately viewed by
02:19:15.519 hundreds of friends and followers and is preserved for ev ever ever in digital form. Not to mention which the internet
02:19:22.000 is open 247. Yeah. So any threats or any posts on social
02:19:27.440 media can happen at any time of the day or night. There were times when you would wake up at 3 in the morning and
02:19:33.281 go, "Is there a post? Is there a post? What does she say now?
02:19:38.558 Is she threatening me now?" But this explains why even a single
02:19:43.599 episode of cyber bullying can be traumatic. Yeah. Because the fear is that it's
02:19:49.280 going to be built by thousands, hundreds or thousands of people and it's never going to be erased. It's going to exist
02:19:56.640 forever. This is exceptionally important.
02:20:05.920 Let's talk about more victim impact. I'm going to read from
02:20:14.399 an article called a developmental approach to cyber bullying prevalence and protective factors. It's by Kowalsski at l. It's in aggression and
02:20:22.000 violent behavior 2019 volume 45. This is on page 22 outcomes of cyber bullying.
02:20:32.479 Quote, "Researchers have consistently found that cyber bullying is associated with a variety of negative consequences
02:20:37.840 for both victims and perpetrators. Among the negative negative consequences experienced by victims are higher levels
02:20:44.319 of anxiety, depression, loneliness, greater suicidal ideiation, lower levels
02:20:50.479 of of self-esteem, and poor academic performance."
02:20:57.520 Have you noticed that? Yeah. Yep. I've noticed all of that.
02:21:05.280 Every one of those applies to you. I'm going to go back to here. I'm going to return to the textbook criminal
02:21:10.399 behavior.
02:21:16.960 I'm going to give I'm going to give their run summary of psychological effects of stalking, specifically
02:21:23.520 cyberstalking. Page 523 of Criminal Behavior by Bard
02:21:30.479 Lombardo. Quote, "Not only does the cyber attack cause psychological damage to the self-esteem and self-image of the
02:21:37.359 victim, but the message may be immediately viewed and forwarded by friends and
02:21:43.280 other peers repeatedly over time." That's the point about how one incident can be so damaging. I think it's
02:21:48.720 important to understand that if you bully someone at school, if you taunt them at school, it may be captured by
02:21:56.240 other people on cell phones, but for the most part, it's a onetime thing and it goes away. And I'm not minimizing that.
02:22:02.240 That's horrible. But cyberstalking goes o on over and over and over again.
02:22:09.200 You can't escape it. Can't escape it. Research studies often report that the overall effects of cyberbullying on the
02:22:15.920 victim include anxiety disorders, sleep problems, loneliness, depression,
02:22:21.680 substance abuse, poor academic achievement, low life satisfaction, and extreme cases suicide attempts.
02:22:31.120 Check, check, check and check.
02:22:41.120 So, I've covered the definitions and criteria of stalking. I've covered the types of stalking. I've covered victim
02:22:46.479 impact. I've covered some of the psychological characteristics of the stalker, especially resentful and
02:22:51.760 rejected stalkers. Let's move on to what I think is really critically important in understanding stalking, and that's
02:22:58.160 the psychology of stalking. We're just getting started, guys.
02:23:03.920 I'm looking at this and you told me about this part and this is important. So, I told you this is going to take a long time.
02:23:08.960 Yeah. And you guys were making fun of my 9 hour live. Dr. John is is ready. He's
02:23:14.240 like, "Hold my Coca-Cola. Here we go.
02:23:20.800 I don't drink Coke. Hold my iced tea." So I put up a
02:23:27.200 diagram from a book called the psychology of stalking clinical and forensic
02:23:33.040 perspectives. It's edited by Jay Reed Malloy. This happens to be from his chapter in the book from the chapter by
02:23:39.680 Jay Reed Mallaloy. Jay Reed Malloy is one of my psychologist heroes. He's
02:23:44.720 brilliant. He's done a tremendous amount of research on psychopaths,
02:23:50.080 early research on psychopaths. He's done a lot of research on the psychology of stalking. He's a brilliant guy.
02:23:59.520 I'm gonna, if you look at the schematic I put up, I'm going to talk about his
02:24:05.680 theory borne out by research and evidence of stalking. So for Malloy,
02:24:16.000 stalking begins with what he calls a narcissistic linking fantasy. This is so
02:24:21.680 interesting to me. Okay, God is She was explaining this to me and
02:24:27.439 I was like, "Oh, okay." You're like, "Oh, crap." Um, okay. Here we go. A narcissistic linking
02:24:35.680 a narcissistic linking fantasy. You'll see on the schematic that under
02:24:42.479 the narcissist, it says narcissistic linking fantasy. And some of the typical
02:24:47.520 narcissistic linking fantasies are they're listed by Mallaloy, special,
02:24:52.640 loved, idealized, admired by, superior to, destined to be with the object.
02:25:00.000 So what does he mean by a narcissistic linking fantasy? What he means essentially is that
02:25:07.840 someone with narcissistic features that's very self-absorbed creates a
02:25:12.880 fantasy that links them to the stalked object. The stopped object in most cases is a person. The narcissistic linking
02:25:20.560 fantasy. So there's a link there's a link between the
02:25:25.760 personality often with narcissistic features. That's how people become so obsessed
02:25:32.319 because they're narcissistic, right? They they're obsessed and they're narcissistic. They create a link to this
02:25:37.680 fantasy of the object. Those those fantasies revolve around feelings. I'll read it. Yeah.
02:25:44.240 Page 18 from the psychology of stalking by Jay Reed Malloy.
02:25:49.680 Quote, "The general dynamic begins with the individual forming in her mind a
02:25:55.359 narcissistic linking fantasy to a particular object. Such fantasies are characterized by
02:26:01.600 conscious thoughts of being loved by or loving, admired by or admiring in
02:26:07.680 parenthesis idealizing, being exactly like in parenthesis mirroring or complimenting in present
02:26:14.000 parenthesis twinship or sharing a dest destiny with a particular object or
02:26:19.040 person in parenthesis merger. So I'm going to read this again without the parenthesis.
02:26:25.280 Such fantasies narcissistic linking fantasies to a particular particular object such fantasies are characterized
02:26:31.200 by conscious thoughts of being loved by or loving admired by or admiring being
02:26:36.800 exactly like or complimenting or sharing a destiny with a particular object or
02:26:41.920 person. So you begin with a narcissistic linking
02:26:47.359 fantasy. What's what the I'm gonna So, I'm going
02:26:55.840 to start with that, okay? Because that's the basis of stalking, but but let's let's I'm going to I'm
02:27:04.080 going to move I'm going to switch lanes a little bit here when I because I'm going to come back to this, but I'm going to switch lanes. Um,
02:27:11.040 so I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to swerve a little bit here and I'm going to talk about uh an Eminem song
02:27:17.680 from 2000 called Stan. A stan is basically a combination of a fan and a
02:27:23.760 stalker. And the song is specifically about a fan who becomes a stalker
02:27:29.280 because presumably Eminem or a celebrity won't respond to the this person's
02:27:35.439 emails. Um, the reason I bring this up
02:27:42.960 is because two of the detectives in Colorado
02:27:48.319 that were responsible for executing the stalking order, they talked to you and
02:27:53.600 Grayson afterwards. And they both referred to the Tik Tocker as a fan
02:27:59.520 girl. In fact, I wrote it down because Grayson told me what they said. One of
02:28:04.880 the detectives said,"I think this is a fan girl who rode your cel yours. I
02:28:10.479 think this is a fan girl who rode your court coattails for a bit and then fell
02:28:15.520 off and now she's very angry about it."
02:28:21.840 So
02:28:27.439 this is important because although I don't I don't really see you or us as
02:28:34.880 celebrities like no in in our little niche in our little true kind niche people know us right so
02:28:43.040 it doesn't really matter whether we're not Brad Pitt we're not Angelina Jolie right like obviously We're not famous,
02:28:50.800 but in our little niche, people know us. And that, by the way, is sufficient.
02:28:56.640 That's sufficient to have someone fang girl you or me, I guess, to some degree. By the
02:29:03.120 way, you get recognized all the time in public. Yesterday, last week was the first time somebody recogn I was at a
02:29:09.439 Trader Joe's. They were like, "Is your wife the one
02:29:14.560 that did that crazy 9-hour live?" No, that was before. I was wearing a mask. I was wearing a mask in Trader
02:29:21.680 Joe's because I thought nobody would recognize me and I don't want to get sick because Trader Joe's is kind of a tight space. But somebody came up to me
02:29:27.760 and they're like, "Are you Dr. John with Hidden True Crime?" And I'm like I was like
02:29:34.880 maybe who's asking? I don't know.
02:29:40.720 I want to thank schedule Go. Anyway, you were very flattered.
02:29:45.840 I was flattered. She was very kind. I just thanked her for for watching us. I
02:29:51.680 told her I was very appreciative that she recognized me and watched us. But
02:29:56.720 it doesn't happen a lot. It doesn't happen a lot. It happened once with me. Um
02:30:02.000 my point is though that although you're not a celebrity at a at a major level,
02:30:07.520 you're a celebrity enough to the Tik Tocker that detectives are applying this
02:30:14.000 label Fang Girl. So
02:30:20.080 that brings me to I I talked earlier about psychological essentialism as a
02:30:25.359 category psychological essentialism. Now I'm going to talk about something called life force essentialism.
02:30:36.240 Life force essentialism is different than category
02:30:43.200 essentialism in the sense that
02:30:51.040 I can't find my notes. Oh, there it is. Life force I got his notes down, guys. They're all
02:30:57.600 spread out and like there you go. Life force essentialism. Boom. I'm doing a good job of managing them.
02:31:02.960 So you are you're doing great. Life force essentialism is different
02:31:08.560 than category essentialism in the sense that with life force essentialism people see
02:31:14.720 things and objects as having an underlying essence and oftent times that underlying essence
02:31:22.560 might be seen as having special properties. So like an example of that would be
02:31:31.359 let's say that Otani, who plays for the Dodgers, hits
02:31:37.200 the game-winning home run in the World Series that's coming up.
02:31:43.840 The baseball that he hits, hypothetically, right? I don't the World Series hasn't been played. The baseball
02:31:50.319 that he hits, let's say the baseball he hits to win the World Series in 2025
02:31:55.359 is is caught by a fan, right? Let's say it's caught by a kid.
02:32:03.040 That baseball now has a lot of value. That's a baseball that
02:32:08.720 if you just bought it off the shelf would be like $5, right? But because Otani hit it, it now acquires what's
02:32:15.680 called life force essentialism. It requires this special property, this almost magical property of having been
02:32:22.000 hit by Otani to win the World Series, right? It it it requires this life force
02:32:29.280 quality that people want and they're willing to pay for. So baseball. This baseball.
02:32:34.319 It's a baseball. It's a baseball. It's just a baseball. Right. But but it's it's but it it's now worth millions
02:32:41.120 of dollars because people attribute these magical properties to it or these special properties to it. Right. The
02:32:47.040 same thing is true of celebrities. So when I was a teen, I saved the pen that
02:32:52.080 a singer signed with backstage. Right. because you thought it had special qualities. And so
02:32:57.920 this is one of the reasons why people want to associate with celebrities. So for example, you know, I remember years
02:33:04.000 ago there was some celebrity auction where I think George Clooney was like auctioning off one of his sweaters or
02:33:09.520 something. And so PE and somebody paid like $250,000 for
02:33:15.280 that. The sweater by itself was probably worth a hundred bucks, 150, I don't
02:33:20.399 know, maybe it's George Clooney. 500 bucks, right? But because George Clooney wore it,
02:33:26.560 people perceived that it had special properties and they bought it for 250,000. And guess what? The person who
02:33:33.760 bought it said, "I will never wash this sweater." Because the idea somehow is that even though it's the same damn
02:33:39.520 sweater, George Clooney might have sweat it now, right? You know, because George Clooney's DNA is on this
02:33:45.760 thing, the person's never going to wash it because they feel like they have some connection to George Clooney, right? So
02:33:51.200 if they wear that sweater, they're like, "Hey, hey, I'm George Clooney." Right? Or whatever. So, but that's called life
02:33:56.800 force essentialism. The reason I mention that is because
02:34:03.680 when we when we think about this idea of a narcissistic linking fantasy, this
02:34:09.120 idea of life force essentialism is part of that fantasy.
02:34:14.240 The fantasy is that if if you're if you're as the detective said, if you're if someone is fangirling someone,
02:34:21.120 they're trying to get some of that essence. So, I think I think there the the part of this narcissistic linking
02:34:28.080 fantasy for the Tik Tocker here has to do with this idea of being a let's call
02:34:33.680 it a pseudo stand or a semi-stand, right? It has to do with the fact that all the detectives in Colorado that that
02:34:40.399 talked to you about this situation, they saw the Tik Tocker as a fan girl. That's
02:34:46.319 how they defined her, right? And so, it's interesting that there's this
02:34:51.920 fantasy here about whatever this special quality you have, it's going to rub off
02:34:57.520 on her. And that's that's part of this that's part of this idea of not wanting
02:35:02.960 to lose that connection to you. And having said that, I think it's if
02:35:09.600 we're going to talk about the psychology of stalking, there's some elements here that there's been some research on
02:35:16.160 stands, okay, that we need to talk about. So some of the elements that they found that that
02:35:23.040 create stands that engage in this type of celebrity worship or even fang girl people at a lower level like you.
02:35:32.160 They found that an insecure parent child attachment is typically common in
02:35:37.359 stands. They found that parental absence so not even abuse not neglect not
02:35:44.319 childhood trauma just parental absence. So one parent, one or the other or both parents can be absent more than usual.
02:35:51.760 The presumption here is obviously that if a parent is absent or not giving a child enough attention, it could be that
02:35:57.760 you grow up in a really big family and maybe one of the parents isn't as is available. The presumption is that the
02:36:05.359 reason you stalk celebrities or you fang girl pseudo celebrities or semi-leelebrities
02:36:12.560 is because you're trying to make up for that parental absence. you're trying to engage with a parental figure or a
02:36:18.720 special figure that somehow is going to give you something you didn't have when you were a child.
02:36:25.120 There's another was a study in Hong Kong that that looked at um
02:36:32.560 adolescents who engaged in celebrity worship.
02:36:37.840 And what they found was a couple of things that the the subjects in the
02:36:44.080 study who did not have any particular preference for celebrities tended to have fairly high confidence and fairly
02:36:52.000 high self-esteem. The kids who did who went after celebrities and engaged the
02:36:58.960 stands who engaged in more celebrity worship, they had a weaker sense of self
02:37:04.560 and lower self-confidence. The absorption abdition model says
02:37:10.399 that stands or fan girls or fanboys whatever stands pursue parasocial
02:37:17.680 relationships. So in other words not real significant rel not relationships
02:37:23.040 where you know someone stands pursu pursue parasocial relationships to make
02:37:28.800 up for shortages in their real lives. And in that pursuit
02:37:36.640 they end up losing themselves. That's called stands in general.
02:37:42.399 That's called the absorption addiction model. And I I think we see elements of that here
02:37:51.040 that I think in some ways that you know a lot of people have said online, get a
02:37:56.399 life, grow up, right? That's saying the same thing. that's saying whatever's going on in this person, this Tik
02:38:02.319 Tocker's life that there it's somehow deficient
02:38:07.359 when it comes to media law, I think that I would define myself a limited public
02:38:12.640 figure. Anyway, keep going. People can disagree with that, but um legally
02:38:18.240 speaking, but it's the same dynamic. The point is it's the same dynamic that
02:38:23.520 fangirling anyone is this attempt to make up for deficits in someone's life.
02:38:28.880 Yeah. Um, there's there's a woman, her name is
02:38:35.359 Amanda Montel. She wrote a book called The Age of Magical Overthinking. This is
02:38:40.640 going to be a quote from her book, Page 24. She's talking about celebrity worship.
02:38:46.479 I'm not, this doesn't refer to you. This just refers to her thoughts in general. In general,
02:38:51.520 quote Montel, quote, page 24. In both the public and private spheres, worship
02:38:56.880 is dehumanizing. To be deified is not so flattering. The
02:39:02.640 dynamic risks annihilating a person's room for complexity and blunders and this sets everyone up
02:39:10.240 for suffering. Wow. It's really fascinating. Worship is dehumanizing. You were kind you were
02:39:16.800 looking at the book and I just see the book. Yeah. I want to hold it up. Keep reading. Keep going.
02:39:23.200 So, let me read that again. So, so
02:39:28.720 some of the dehumanization in this smear campaign is the fact that you're portrayed as evil,
02:39:35.200 right? Like that you've been labeled psychological essentialism. You they've taken certain texts or whatever and
02:39:43.040 private text and they've labeled you evil and then there's there's this moral crusade. But there's other ways you can
02:39:49.600 dehumanize. And and one of them is by portraying someone as something
02:39:56.399 they're not. Not giving them the room to, as she says, not not giving them the
02:40:03.200 room to be complex and to make blunders. If you don't give someone the room to be
02:40:08.240 complex and to make blunders, you according to her, I agree, you set everyone up for suffering because you're
02:40:15.600 not defining it as a real relationship. Yeah. You're defining it as a cliched,
02:40:22.560 right, rigid, narrow relationship. And if you do that, so if you're fangirling
02:40:27.840 someone and the relationship turns out to be not what you expected, there's a lot of room in there for disappointment.
02:40:35.520 There's a lot of room in there for anger. There's a lot of room to turn against someone because that
02:40:40.720 relationship is turning out not to be what you wanted. And so, now that I'm thinking about this, I'm actually going
02:40:46.319 to read I'm going to read another quote from Amanda's book, Act Like I Know.
02:40:52.960 Really interesting. You did not talk to me about this. Act like I know her. I I don't know. Yeah. Um, it's a very interesting book.
02:41:01.520 That's true. I see celebrities dehumanized all the time. real celebrities.
02:41:06.800 Here's what she says. Just it's just a sentence. It's simple, but I I think it's totally relevant to our discussion.
02:41:13.120 Quote, page 21. Quote, "Narly every Stanworship A-lister has seen their
02:41:19.600 flocks mania pervert overnight from devotion to disdain."
02:41:26.560 Some of the people she talks about, Beyonce, who is exceptionally private.
02:41:32.160 Um, there's so many. Charlie XCX. There's so many, right? Like if you're
02:41:38.240 an A-list, if you're a stand worship A-listister,
02:41:44.319 loved by your flock, loved by your group, you can literally go overnight from
02:41:50.399 devotion to disdain based upon one mistake, right? And I
02:41:56.319 think you're not an al-ist celebrity, right? Like, but but the point is like part of this campaign is to try to flip
02:42:03.280 that script. Part of this campaign is to try to get your flock to go from
02:42:08.399 devotion to disdain by dehumanizing you, by not giving you
02:42:14.479 any room for complexity, not giving you any room for vulnerability, not giving you any room for blunder, as she puts
02:42:22.640 it.
02:42:28.399 Yeah. And
02:42:34.240 fortunately our our viewers are fortunately our viewers are astute and
02:42:40.960 they see through that. But but that's part of this. Yeah. You're gems, not minions.
02:42:47.760 Yeah. Our gems, not minions. Yeah. I know, right?
02:42:53.040 Let's go back now. Let's let's return. So I I talked about this idea of stands and what creates a stand and uh this
02:42:59.840 really important idea of life force essentialism in terms of right you you want you want to buy the celebrities
02:43:06.560 u sweater so that you can feel like you're getting some of that special quality right
02:43:13.920 which I don't know how someone could afford a sweater for 250,000 but
02:43:19.200 but hey someone did and they love it so okay let's go back to our diagram. So
02:43:25.439 there's a it begins with a narcissistic linking fantasy or life force essentialism
02:43:31.439 and then you have you go to what he calls acutunic acute or chronic rejection. So you have the fantasy, you
02:43:37.280 have rejection. The rejection leads to feelings of shame or humiliation
02:43:42.640 which is then defended against with rage which then leads to behavioral pursuit.
02:43:48.560 That's the stalking. It fuels behavioral pursuit. The behavioral pursuit is intended to hurt, to control, to damage
02:43:55.600 or destroy. Only after the target, you is hurt,
02:44:04.479 controlled, damaged, or destroyed is the narcissistic linking fantasy restored.
02:44:11.200 Wow. And this gets back to the idea that we've been talking about all along
02:44:18.479 that the goal of a cyber stalker or any stalker, a
02:44:23.760 physical stalker, it doesn't matter. The goal is to ruin and damage the person
02:44:30.240 beyond repair or to have them end up dead. That's how
02:44:36.960 stuff like this that's how this stuff ends. And the reason according to Mallaloy
02:44:45.200 is because that's the only way for the stalker to restore the narcissistic
02:44:50.479 linking fantasy.
02:44:55.600 Okay. Now, let's we talked about
02:45:02.800 so much. Yeah. But we talked about recently psychology
02:45:08.640 talking. We've talked about the research on that. We've talked about Mallaloyy's chart, types of stalkers,
02:45:16.319 stalking criteria, definitions. One of the big issues out there
02:45:21.840 in addition to all that, one of the big issues out there is one of the arguments
02:45:26.880 for the Tik Tocker, for the stalker, is that it's free speech.
02:45:32.000 Right? This is probably the biggest argument. Well, it's free speech. This is just mean girls. Free speech. Mean
02:45:38.960 Girls. Who cares? Mean girls are mean girls. That doesn't mean you should get a stalking injunction. Don't weaponize
02:45:45.040 the legal system. Ah, stupid. Cat fight. Cat fight.
02:45:52.080 That's how John talks when he's not on camera. Like, Lauren, what's up? No.
02:45:59.600 Ah um
02:46:05.760 one thing that philosophers do um that you know since I was
02:46:11.760 majored in philosophy as an undergrad. One of the things I always loved about
02:46:18.640 philosophy even back when I was an undergrad which getting his undergrad at Princeton might
02:46:25.120 I add winning the thesis award. I know that you you always underplay and at this moment now that people are trying
02:46:31.520 to mock your education, I'm going to own it. He's brilliant scholarship.
02:46:38.319 Valditorian, go ahead. There's this argument about free speech and as a matter of fact, in the in the
02:46:46.160 the tick tockers attorney's objection,
02:46:51.279 that was the heart of it. Yeah, this is free speech. Who cares if she says that you want to have
02:46:56.640 non-consensual relations with your brother, right? Who cares if she's threatening to harm your business? Who
02:47:02.399 cares if she's reaching out to everyone in your business context and trying to ruin you and damage you? None of that
02:47:07.439 matters because this is free speech. So, you know, one of the things philosophers like to do is like we like to think about thought experiments and and I
02:47:14.160 thought I came up with one. Okay, a thought experiment. Okay, for all of us for all of us at home,
02:47:20.080 including me, I am at home. A thought experiment with Dr. John Matias thought experiment PhD. All right.
02:47:26.960 Um, and the reason we we we present thought experiments is because the the reason philosophers do thought
02:47:32.640 experiments is because they're trying to figure out kind of the boundaries around an issue, right? And and whether by
02:47:39.359 going through a thought experiment, you can ask questions about whether this is free speech, whether it's not, right?
02:47:44.800 Um, I'm presenting a hypothetical, but I think one p you could see this easily as being real. So,
02:47:50.560 okay, my in my thought experiment, there's a woman, Sylvia, and Sylvia has a daughter
02:47:56.240 named Becky. Okay. And Becky's best friend is someone in school. They're adolescence.
02:48:01.600 Okay. They're both 16 years old. Becky's best friend is Victoria. Okay. Becky and Victoria.
02:48:07.760 Yeah. And Victoria happens to be the captain of the volleyball team. She's very well-liked.
02:48:13.760 She's considered to be one of the most more attractive girls in in in her
02:48:19.439 class, which is I think sophomore or junior years in high school.
02:48:24.880 But Becky and Victoria have a falling out. And Becky's very angry at Victoria
02:48:31.520 because Becky wanted Victoria to help her
02:48:38.479 join the in crowd and Victoria was kind of on the fence. She didn't really know how to do it, but she was happy to help
02:48:44.160 her. But Becky thought it wasn't enough. Okay. Becky felt like there were that she was
02:48:49.680 being shunned by Victoria in certain areas and that Victoria could have helped her more to become more popular.
02:48:56.960 Okay. So, Becky goes home
02:49:02.319 to her mother, Sylvia, and Becky says, "Mom, I'm really hurt. I just got shunned. I
02:49:10.240 just got rejected by my best friend Victoria and I don't know what to do and I don't want to deal with her anymore
02:49:15.760 and I'm done with it. And Sylvia says,
02:49:21.359 "You know what? I love true crime. There's this raging
02:49:26.399 debate online now about a stalking situation and everyone says it's free
02:49:32.000 speech and I agree it's free speech." And you know what you should do, Becky?
02:49:37.359 You should open a Tik Tok account and you should target Victoria.
02:49:43.520 And what you should do with your account is you should try to harm her and ruin
02:49:49.520 her life as much as you can because that's perfectly acceptable under free
02:49:54.960 speech. And what I recommend you start with is that you start with a post that you want
02:50:01.279 to come back to. By the way, you want to repeatedly come back to this post, but you start with a post about how Victoria
02:50:11.120 engaged in non-consensual contact with
02:50:16.160 several of her younger siblings. And Becky says,
02:50:23.040 "Oh, that's great. That sounds great. I hate Victoria. I want to start this Tik Tok. I want to
02:50:30.160 really hurt her." So she posts the the she posts the first Tik Tok in a video
02:50:37.040 of Victoria engaging in non-consensual relations
02:50:44.240 with her younger siblings goes viral.
02:50:53.279 Victoria is really hurt. People believe it. People start shunning Victoria. People start avoiding her.
02:51:01.840 None of it's true, by the way. But Victoria becomes a bit of a
02:51:08.160 laughingstock. People are talking endlessly behind her back about the
02:51:13.760 supposed non-consensual contact that Victoria had with her
02:51:19.520 younger siblings. Victoria is so upset by this and she's
02:51:27.120 receiving so much mockery. at school that she has to
02:51:32.800 within a year she has to leave the volleyball team and she leaves school to
02:51:38.080 be homeschooled by her mother.
02:51:46.560 Becky continues because Sylvia, her mother says, "You know what? You should
02:51:52.160 post as much as you can. Post every day. Go back to the post about non-consensual
02:51:58.000 contact, about Victoria being an abuser. Go back to that regularly, but post
02:52:03.439 other stuff. But now post her dropping out of school to be homeschooled and how only losers do that.
02:52:11.040 Now post that she wasn't strong enough to stay in school, that she wasn't
02:52:16.800 strong enough to stay on the volleyball team. I want you to just mock her because free speech
02:52:27.920 They graduate from high school. Victoria does it obviously not in the actual school. She does it from home.
02:52:37.279 And when she graduates, Becky posts that homeschool doesn't really count.
02:52:44.240 that even though she passed all the accreditation exams and did what she needed to do, that Victoria is a loser
02:52:51.920 because she had to be homeschooled and she couldn't stand the fact that she couldn't deal with the truth
02:52:58.080 that she was in fact an abuser. But of course, Becky's posting all kinds
02:53:04.000 of other things like she's saying she says, "I'm going to burn your flipping
02:53:09.920 kingdom to the ground." She's saying she's going to expose her
02:53:15.120 that because she was her best friend, she has all these private text messages and emails that she's going to put out there to harm her.
02:53:25.359 She continues posting every day. Years pass, still posting.
02:53:32.560 Victoria gets married. She sees that Becky sees that Victoria's
02:53:39.600 posted photos of her marriage. So, she mocks her marriage. She mocks her husband. She talks about how ugly he is,
02:53:45.520 what a loser he is, how he has no future, what a loser she is.
02:53:50.720 She continues to say that whatever Victoria has in her life, she's going to take it away and she's
02:53:56.960 going to burn her kingdom to the ground.
02:54:02.000 Victoria finally has kids. When her first child is born, Becky
02:54:09.920 posts that she believes Victoria is now going to abuse her child.
02:54:15.200 She posts that her children are losers. She posts that CPS should become
02:54:20.240 involved because of course she's an abuser and the the child are going to be taken
02:54:25.840 away. So why doesn't CPS jump in now?
02:54:31.920 And she can do all this because of course free speech.
02:54:38.560 She can say whatever she damn well pleases, right? Free speech.
02:54:47.920 Victoria has another child. Couple years later, same thing. She has
02:54:53.040 another child. Same thing. Becky keeps posting that her children are going to be sexually abused.
02:54:59.760 She keeps posting that Victoria is an abuser, that CBS should get involved, take her kids. She won't stop with that
02:55:05.439 theme.
02:55:10.720 Victoria is struggling. This is taking a toll on her. It's taking an immense toll on her. So, finally, Victoria and her
02:55:17.760 husband decide that they're going to pursue a stalking injunction with the court.
02:55:24.399 The initial junction injunction is granted, but they go to court and
02:55:29.439 basically the judge says this is just a catfight between
02:55:35.520 two now adult females, but this is a cat fight between adult females and of
02:55:42.000 course free speech because you know what? You know what, Victoria?
02:55:48.720 I don't think Becky should be silenced. I don't think anyone should be silenced.
02:55:53.920 So just basically take it
02:55:59.040 and even though you know Becky's a little bit of a mean girl, maybe she's cyber bullying you a little bit. I think
02:56:05.520 that stalking is just showing up at someone's home with a gun and she hasn't done that. She hasn't
02:56:12.720 approached you in your car. She hasn't approached you. They live in the same town. She hasn't approached you at the
02:56:17.840 grocery store. She hasn't approached you anywhere. she hasn't physically harmed you.
02:56:25.680 So, the judge actually goes on record and says, "You know what? This stalking injunction is dismissed
02:56:33.840 because, quote, this reminds me of the Real Housewives of Salt Lake City."
02:56:43.600 So, guess what? Go back to your life. Just grin and bear it and carry on.
02:56:53.600 Victoria has been supported by her husband for most of her life, but she finally decides
02:56:59.840 after having three children, all of whom are targeted by the stalker, by Becky,
02:57:08.240 she decides to get a job. She goes back to school. She gets certified as a
02:57:13.600 teacher. She starts a job. And what happens? Becky starts posting
02:57:20.800 again about how Victoria is an abuser and that she's going to harm the children in her class because she's
02:57:26.560 teaching in elementary school and then she needs to lose her job.
02:57:33.359 Victoria does lose her job because of these posts. Their posts are persistent.
02:57:38.640 They're repeated. Victoria has told Becky numerous times, "Please stop.
02:57:45.040 Please leave me alone. I feel threatened. I feel harassed. But the
02:57:50.880 court will not protect her. She's forced out of her job. She's
02:57:56.640 forced to resign because of all the rumors and gossip about her being an abuser.
02:58:02.720 So what does she do? She finds another job. This time she goes to the local
02:58:09.840 community center. She loves working with kids. She's got three kids. That's her passion. But guess what? Becky's
02:58:17.120 persistent. Becky takes back to social media and tells the community center.
02:58:26.160 You are an abuser. You should not be working at this community center. You're putting all these kids at risk. Lo and
02:58:33.520 behold, Victoria loses her position once again
02:58:42.240 because Victoria doesn't know what to do. Because she still loves kids,
02:58:50.800 she starts a YouTube channel. And the YouTube channel is it pertains
02:58:56.640 to children's education. She reads books, children's books. She's just
02:59:01.760 doing anything she can to help kids. But guess what? Becky thinks that's absurd because
02:59:07.920 there's no proof of this whatsoever. But Becky decides, of course, that she
02:59:13.840 shouldn't have her YouTube channel or any way to make a living because she's an abuser.
02:59:20.800 So, she starts posting relentlessly on her Tik Tok again about Victoria and her
02:59:26.880 abuse. an online mob flocks to her channel, which is starting to get some
02:59:32.160 momentum finally and she's canled.
02:59:41.439 Not only is she canled, but her friends, her co-workers, her
02:59:46.880 colleagues in the community, the people at the school where she taught,
02:59:52.080 they all turn against her.
03:00:00.560 So finally after all these losses
03:00:06.399 and all this trauma and this rumor that she can't dispel even though she
03:00:12.880 said repeatedly I did not do that. Even her siblings have said she did not do
03:00:19.120 that. It doesn't matter. She's continued with this lie over and over again. It's
03:00:25.760 called the sleeper effect. If you tell a lie enough over and over again, people believe it.
03:00:30.960 People start to believe it, which is actually what's happened. That's what's happening with you. People are telling a lie. Lies over and over
03:00:37.920 and people are believing it. So finally
03:00:44.160 after years and by the way, so
03:00:50.319 Becky meets with her mother for lunch and
03:00:57.920 she tells her mom, Sylvia, she said, "Mom, that was great. You know, you you
03:01:04.399 you allowed me to see quite clearly that because of free speech, I have a lifetime pass. I have a lifetime ticket
03:01:12.640 to just ridicule and threaten and harass
03:01:18.000 my this friend of mine who didn't do enough for me and who rejected me. And she so she thanks her mom and says,
03:01:24.240 "Wow, that this has just been great. Free speech is so great. I love it."
03:01:30.640 And oddly enough, Sylvia says at this lunch,
03:01:35.680 Sylvia says, 'You know, I I've been watching this and you know, may maybe it's too much. Maybe
03:01:42.080 you've gone too far. Maybe you should really rein this in a little bit. But Becky says, "No, mom, you taught me free
03:01:49.359 speech. Like, I can do any damn I can say any damn thing I want. I'm not stalking her. I haven't showed up at her
03:01:56.160 home with a gun. I haven't followed her in a car. I haven't followed her at this at the mall. I haven't followed her in a
03:02:03.040 restaurant. I've done nothing wrong. I can say whatever I want. Free speech.
03:02:15.680 So the way this ends and I don't know the final ending but the way this story ends
03:02:21.520 the way the thought experiment ends is that Victoria's she wakes up one morning in her bed
03:02:35.200 distraught.
03:02:55.359 and she tells her husband that she can't keep doing it.
03:03:04.000 Okay, let's take this
03:03:09.279 The way this ends is Victoria
03:03:14.960 is in her bed crying.
03:03:21.760 She wakes her husband up and she tells him
03:03:27.040 that she can't keep doing it. She's decided that she can't go any further.
03:03:33.120 And she's thinking about killing herself. What happens after that? I don't know.
03:03:40.560 That's the end of the thought experiment. I don't know what she did.
03:03:47.840 But she wakes up at that point because she realize she realizes
03:03:54.080 that Becky's not going to stop.
03:03:59.520 until she's completely ruined her life or she's deceased.
03:04:06.720 Because Becky understands that by hiding behind this argument of free speech that
03:04:12.479 she has a lifetime ticket to target and arrest any person she wants over
03:04:17.920 anything without any repercussions because of free speech.
03:04:26.080 So my challenge to people with this thought experience, my challenge to anyone
03:04:33.359 is to say to them, if you're a mother of someone, a daughter or a son, if you're
03:04:40.319 a mother, would you recommend
03:04:48.880 that one of your sons or daughters engages in this type of behavior?
03:04:58.240 And if you do, I guess that's your choice, right? Free
03:05:04.399 speech. But I I'm I'm curious, you know, I'm
03:05:10.240 curious. Is that a reasonable
03:05:18.640 Is that a reasonable course of action for a parent to say to their child or
03:05:24.560 for an adult to say to themselves, I I have an issue with this person. I'm
03:05:31.920 gonna set up a targeted social media account to harm them. And I will spend
03:05:37.040 the rest of my life engaged in this campaign of harm
03:05:43.120 until I ruin this human being. And even if you argue that that's free
03:05:49.279 speech, that doesn't even consider because this is a philosophical thought experiment.
03:05:55.520 You have to consider the ethical and moral implications of that behavior. We're not even addressing that.
03:06:03.120 Are there ethical and moral implications to letting your child
03:06:08.479 set up such an account under the opaces of free speech
03:06:15.760 to harm someone else? That's my question.
03:06:22.080 I do want to return to a part of that thought experiment, by the way, and it
03:06:27.120 has to do with the part about going into court and being told essentially that
03:06:32.479 this is just nothing but mean girl stuff. Even though Victoria in this thought
03:06:39.840 experiment, Victoria has never responded online. She's never said anything about
03:06:46.640 Becky. She's never fought back, right?
03:06:53.760 I'm going to go back to the textbook,
03:06:59.920 Stalkers and Their Victims, Second Edition.
03:07:06.800 Let's consider this whole idea of a cat fight.
03:07:13.200 Here's what Mullen, they have a chapter,
03:07:19.439 chapter 11. It's on female stalkers.
03:07:24.640 Here's what Mullen at L say about female stalking.
03:07:32.560 Victimization studies, quote, this is on page 136. Victimization studies indicate
03:07:38.240 that females are seldom prosecuted for stalking offenses
03:07:43.520 with criminal justice intervention most likely to proceed in those casings involving a male accused of stalking a
03:07:49.600 woman. So this is this is persistent that many people including some law
03:07:57.359 enforcement, judges, you name it, they don't see stalking as stalking unless it
03:08:03.520 involves a male. females are just not prosecuted as much.
03:08:09.279 And that speaks to this issue of the mean girl catfight thing, right? That this stereotype
03:08:15.279 that stalking is chasing someone with a gun and specifically you better be a male otherwise you're not going to be
03:08:21.600 prosecuted because if you're a female doing it, it's not serious. Yeah, it's a cat fight, right?
03:08:30.479 I'll go on. Quote, "Put simply, stalking by females is yet to be afforded the
03:08:36.240 same degree of seriousness attached to males who harass.
03:08:41.840 This despite empirical evidence that females are no less intrusive or
03:08:47.680 persistent in their stalking and that they are no less a threat to their
03:08:52.720 victims.
03:09:06.720 I just want to say on that issue that when it comes to stalking,
03:09:13.840 and this is consistent with the research I just read, there's clearly a sexist bias. Males are prosecuted, females aren't.
03:09:20.640 when females engage in this type of behavior, even though they're equally dangerous,
03:09:26.960 the research shows this that they're dismissed. And you know what's interesting about
03:09:32.960 your situation? I really appreciate the fact that that certain men like Kobe Ryan reached out
03:09:39.600 to you and said, "Thank you for that vulnerability. Thank you for that type of raw emotion."
03:09:47.040 But you know what? There's a lot of people that are going to really struggle with
03:09:53.120 that type of raw emotion. There's a lot of people that are going to struggle with that type of a vulnerability. There's a lot of people that are very
03:09:59.600 uncomfortable and they're because of that they're labeling you things like histrionic,
03:10:06.000 right? They're dismissing you because you're a female expressing
03:10:11.520 emotion. This is where the sexist bias comes in. They're dismissing you as not
03:10:17.920 serious, as untrustworthy,
03:10:24.399 right? They're dismissing you, as frivolous, as silly, as enga being
03:10:32.080 engaged in a cat fight, as as a dispute between mean girls because you're female.
03:10:41.439 because the stalker wasn't following you with the gun. It doesn't matter.
03:10:49.359 People can't handle the type of vulnerability and emotion that you expressed on that live for
03:10:56.000 hours. What's the response? It's to call you histrionic. It's to call you a liar.
03:11:03.680 It's to say you're faking. It's to say you're doing it for clicks. You're doing it for attention. Right? That's because,
03:11:10.479 and by the way, one of the people saying this because of this was on our show years ago. And I
03:11:18.399 will say this, one of the worst moments I've ever had in five years,
03:11:25.200 one of the moments that pissed me off to no end, unlike every other moment on any show I've ever been on, this person was
03:11:32.160 on the show and somebody a a viewer asked a question of me that was
03:11:37.760 extremely emotional and I was pondering the question. You could see I was
03:11:42.800 getting emotional. I was going to give one of the best responses I've ever given. And you know
03:11:49.200 what happened? Because this person couldn't handle the fact that I was getting emotional. They cut me off.
03:11:56.640 They absolutely cut me off. Refused to let me answer because they couldn't
03:12:02.479 handle that emotion in a male, especially in a male. That raw emotion
03:12:08.640 that I was about to express. And I was so angry. If this person wonders why
03:12:15.520 she's not on our channel, you might want to look at yourself. You might want to
03:12:20.720 look at the fact that you cut me off in one of the most critical moments on one of our shows that I've ever had. You
03:12:27.680 might want to look at the fact that people didn't like you. You might want to look at the fact that you spoke over
03:12:34.160 Lauren and myself. You might want to look at the fact that you thought you owned this channel when you didn't. you
03:12:40.319 might want to look at the fact that there was a ground swell of people who despised you.
03:12:52.560 So this idea of female stalkers being frivolous and
03:13:01.279 silly and hysterical and overly emotional.
03:13:07.279 Most of the people saying that are males. because they can't handle that type of
03:13:13.040 emotion. They can't handle that vulnerability. So, the the easy response to that is to point the finger at you
03:13:18.160 and say, "You're a lying. You're faking."
03:13:25.120 The goal is not only to play in this to the to to
03:13:30.960 fall into the stereotype of of that that only males are stalkers, only males can be violent. That's
03:13:39.439 The goal is to disempower you. The goal is to disempower all females
03:13:45.200 that are stalked by other females. The goal is to make you look irrational.
03:13:53.279 The goal is to make you look weak and stupid and irrational. It's to call you a liar, to discredit you. And you know
03:14:00.960 what it's about? It's about the fact that these people cannot handle vulnerability.
03:14:08.399 It's about the fact that years ago when that person cut me off, she could not
03:14:13.439 handle my vulnerability and my raw emotion. And I'm still pissed.
03:14:20.880 years later, I'm pissed that somebody cut me off when I was going to answer my question
03:14:30.080 and probably the most vulnerable way I could ever answer a question
03:14:36.239 because it was about my son and it was about JJ.
03:14:46.239 So, I say to all the haters
03:14:52.080 who are claiming that you're lying and that this can't be stalking,
03:14:57.279 I say to them, I challenge them
03:15:06.239 to look again and to check their own emotions and to
03:15:11.520 check themselves and their own inability to be vulnerable.
03:15:19.920 because what they're doing is despicable.
03:15:28.399 And I want to make a comment too. I want to go back to this idea of
03:15:34.000 psychological essentialism where we started that all people at some level want to see themselves as good people.
03:15:45.520 And that people often take small traits and amplify them, generalize from those
03:15:51.200 traits to define another human being. Remember we talked about remember Gabriel the herder?
03:15:57.439 Mhm. Gabriel the four-year-old herder. There's a lot of people out there that
03:16:04.160 are mocking your looks, that are making fun of your appearance.
03:16:11.359 And I just want to say on that, I mean, people can, you know, you're laughing about some of it. It's funny, right?
03:16:18.000 Like some of it's roasting you, but but let let's look a little deeper, right? Like
03:16:24.560 that's psychological essentialism. If you want to disempower a female, the
03:16:31.200 easiest way to do it is to make is to mock her looks and then to say, "Look,
03:16:37.520 she looks stupid. She must be stupid." Right? It's to do the very thing that
03:16:45.040 the four-year-old was doing to Gabriel, which was to take a particular element,
03:16:50.800 a particular attrib.
03:17:10.239 You know what? That's And it pisses me off
03:17:17.439 because it is so sexist and it is so demeaning and it is so disempowering of
03:17:22.960 women and you get it all the time unfairly.
03:17:29.920 You get it from women. But it's it's a it's a classic case of psychological
03:17:35.680 essentialism in the sense that you're taking one attribute, your
03:17:41.840 looks, or any female's looks. I'm sure a lot of females out there have gone through this.
03:17:48.399 It's taking one aspect, one attribute of you, and generalizing to your personality and defining you in terms of
03:17:55.200 that. Yeah. And if that's not sexist, then you know,
03:18:02.399 then I don't know what the hell is. But I, you know, but in today's world, it doesn't really matter,
03:18:07.680 right? It doesn't matter in the sense that and it's not, by the way, you're so used
03:18:13.520 to it, it's not going to harm you, right? But but I think what I want to say is I
03:18:20.080 want to people to be aware of what let's call this what it is.
03:18:26.640 When you mock someone's looks,
03:18:31.920 do you really believe that that's defining their personality? Do you really believe
03:18:40.080 that that is a valid
03:18:48.880 perspective on who that person is? that that that's a valid
03:18:55.279 insight into who that person is. It's obviously not.
03:19:04.880 Yeah. So,
03:19:12.160 I'm not trying to change anybody's mind. I know that cognitive, you know, I I
03:19:17.359 talked about it earlier.
03:19:25.600 I know that confirmation bias and
03:19:32.800 the cognitive response principle mean that no matter what information you give someone, they're not going to change
03:19:38.720 their mind. They're just going to come up with reasons why they're right. I know from confirmation bias that whatever I say here, they already have
03:19:44.960 an opinion. They're going to believe that no matter what. So, I'm just putting this out there because
03:19:51.359 I'm trying to complement your 9-h hour live with my
03:19:58.479 lesser version of that, my researchbased live that analyzes the situation.
03:20:05.520 Because you know what? That's what our viewers expect. That's what our viewers like. This is what we do
03:20:11.680 at Hidden True Crime. at Hidden True Crime. And for those of you that didn't know, because I think a lot of people that are
03:20:17.120 talking about the epic 9-hour live haven't even watched us before,
03:20:22.800 this is what we do here at Hidden True Crime. This is what we do.
03:20:30.399 Um, I do want to get back to the free speech issue. There's a couple of things I want to I want to talk about at the
03:20:36.399 end here, and then we're going to be done soon.
03:20:42.640 Um, you read this on your live. This is the
03:20:49.920 memorandum. Yes. By our attorney
03:20:56.239 Daston. This is his reply. This is his reply to their free speech
03:21:03.120 argument. the reply memorandum in support of requests for civil stocking
03:21:09.359 and petitioners pre-trial brief.
03:21:17.040 I'm going to read some of this because I think it's important and it's going to reiterate some of the issues we've talked about especially about free
03:21:22.880 speech. This is from the introduction. quote, "Respondents opposition fundamentally
03:21:29.439 mischaracterizes both the law and the facts of this case by advancing two legally unsupported defenses. Number
03:21:36.399 one, the petitioner's social media presence somehow diminishes her protection from stalking. Think about
03:21:42.880 that. She's arguing. She argued, her attorneys argued that her social media presence
03:21:53.520 that your social media presence diminished your protection from stalking.
03:22:01.520 Tell that to Taylor Swift. So somehow because you're a limited
03:22:08.640 public figure public figure uh and you have a social media presence, never once did you
03:22:13.680 respond to her, by the way, but that diminishes your protection from stalking. And two, that creating
03:22:19.439 multiple social media accounts dedicated to attacking petitioner's character constituted protected quote
03:22:26.319 public discourse. Both arguments fail as a matter of law. The evidence before
03:22:31.520 this court, including sworn declarations from multiple witnesses and documented exhibits, demonstrates a calculated
03:22:38.399 campaign of harassment that has caused petitioner you to experience ideiation
03:22:44.319 for the first time in her life. As petitioner testified, up until 2025, I
03:22:49.439 have never questioned that before. This has felt like a complete nightmare. I can't wake up from unquote.
03:22:58.640 The dangerous precedent respondent seeks would eviscerate stalking protections for anyone with an online presence and
03:23:06.479 would transform social media into a free fire zone for personal vendettas.
03:23:14.479 The court should reject respondents attempt to weaponize the first amendment as a shield for targeted harassment.
03:23:30.720 The First Amendment protects robust public debate and criticism, but it does not protect courses of conduct intended
03:23:38.399 to cause fear or emotional distress, targeted harassment campaigns, true
03:23:43.520 threats, and stalking behavior. This is from Virginia v. Black, 538 US.
03:23:50.399 Countermen versus Colorado 600 US.
03:23:58.000 Quote, "The First Amendment P permits restrictions on speech that threaten unlawful violence or consist of targeted
03:24:06.399 harassment. The most compelling evidence that
03:24:11.760 respondents conduct constitutes stalking rather than protected speech is that the
03:24:17.200 singular purpose of her social media is the singular purpose of their social media accounts. Respondent has created
03:24:23.520 at least two separate social media accounts dedicated exclusively to disparishing petitioner under the thin
03:24:29.920 veil of discussing quote an ex-friend. This is not a case where respondent
03:24:35.120 maintains general social media accounts that occasionally reference petitioner while discussing various topics. These
03:24:42.560 accounts were created for one purpose only to conduct a sustained campaign
03:24:48.880 attacking the petitioner's moral character. When 100% of accounts content
03:24:54.720 targets a single individual, it cannot be characterized as public discourse. It
03:25:01.279 is a harassment campaign. My attorney is Dustin Dao, by the way.
03:25:08.160 Many people asked. They thought this was really well done. Thank you, Dustin.
03:25:14.160 The Supreme Court has long distinguished between speech on matters of public concern and purely private disputes. See
03:25:21.040 Snyder versus Phelps. Personal grievances between former friends
03:25:27.120 do not constitute matters of public concern that warrant First Amendment protection when used as weapons for
03:25:32.800 harassment. This is revenge masquerading as free
03:25:38.319 speech.
03:25:46.800 Each I'm skipping around by the way. I read the whole thing on my 9 hour live. You're making your point. The
03:25:51.840 clear intent is to damage the petitioner's reputation and cause emotional distress. Each account
03:25:57.760 creation, each post, and each attempt to expand the audience for these attacks constitutes a separate act in the
03:26:04.000 stalking pattern. The use of multiple platforms demonstrates escalation and
03:26:09.200 obsession behavior, not legitimate commentary. Here, the numbers speak for themselves.
03:26:15.520 50 plus posts and videos about you petitioner over a six-month period
03:26:20.560 across multiple platforms. This far exceeds the statutory minimum of quote two or more acts required by Utah law.
03:26:29.520 Each of these 50 plus posts represents a deliberate choice to continue the harassment campaign. This is not a case
03:26:36.000 of one or two ill-considered post and a moment of anger. This is a sustained deliberate campaign spanning half a
03:26:42.239 year. The sheer volume and duration demonstrate the obsessive nature of respondents conduct and her intent to
03:26:49.439 cause ongoing distress.
03:26:54.960 The Ragsdale court emphasized examining the cumulative
03:27:00.160 effect of conduct. A social media harassment campaign creates unique cumulative harm. We talked about this in
03:27:06.160 the research. permanent digital footprint of attacks, viral potential of expanding the audience, 24/7
03:27:13.200 accessibility to harassing content and recruitment of others to participate in the harassment, which she did.
03:27:21.120 Also, ongoing nature, the ongoing nature creates the fear of escalation.
03:27:30.000 respondents opposition states it is simply not reasonable that Matias would expect to continually engage in public
03:27:36.880 discussion without encountering speech he disagrees with this fundamentally
03:27:42.239 misunderstands the reasonable person analysis under Utah code 7-6 I mean
03:27:47.840 776-5-106.5 the proper inquiry
03:27:53.600 is whether a reasonable person in partitional circumstances would experience fear or emotional distress us
03:27:59.920 from the specific conduct alleged, not whether public figures
03:28:05.520 should generally expect criticism.
03:28:11.760 The Supreme Court in counter Memphis versus Colorado recently reaffirmed that states may constitutionally prohibit
03:28:18.640 true threats and stalking conduct, requiring only a showing of recklessness
03:28:24.560 regarding the threatening nature of communications.
03:28:32.239 There's a com he puts there's a compelling government interest that includes protecting citizens from fear
03:28:38.720 targeted harassment and stalking of a compelling nature.
03:28:43.920 The requested injunction seeks only to prevent stalking conduct, not legitimate
03:28:49.120 criticism or protected speech. It is narrowly towered to serve the government's interest in protecting
03:28:55.040 petitioner from targeted harassment online.
03:29:08.319 The evidence establishes the that respondent created a systematic harassment campaign across multiple
03:29:14.000 class platforms, producing 53 plus documented videos and 33 plus Instagram
03:29:19.200 posts dedicated exclusively to targeting the petitioner which was confirmed by
03:29:24.319 one of the witnesses. This unprecedented volume of content combined with witness testimony
03:29:30.960 established the clear intent to harass rather than to engage in protected speech.
03:29:41.279 Respondent published a video with caption without his consent falsely insinuating the sexual assault of the
03:29:47.760 petitioner's dying brother who just passed away in March of 2025. The psychological cruelty of this course
03:29:54.239 cannot be overstated. Attacking a grieving sister with false sexual assault allegations about her deceased
03:30:00.960 brother. The respondent posted recordings of
03:30:07.439 petitioner's voice comparing her murderer to murderer Jodie Aras, garnering 33,000 plus views.
03:30:22.560 The events in Boise IO also demonstrate how the respondents online campaign
03:30:27.840 translated into real world stalking involving multiple accompllices. He lists those. I'm not going to go over
03:30:34.080 those. You've covered all these. I'm just covering the main points.
03:30:39.439 What Trisha Griffith said was really good to mention her. It is good.
03:30:46.130 [Applause] I'm just going to finish with this and then we're going to I'm going to finish up with some final thoughts.
03:30:53.680 Each post, each confrontation, each violation represents a separate act far exceeding the statutory minimum, which
03:31:00.239 is two two incidents. That's all you needed, right? Just two.
03:31:06.080 But more than that, let me just reiterate her violating the stalking injunction at Crime Con, that should
03:31:12.000 have been an automatic automatic grounds for enforcement. Yeah. And the judge wouldn't even hear it.
03:31:21.680 Respondents opposition rests on two fundamental legal errors. Number one, the belief that public visibility
03:31:26.800 diminishes one right one's right to free to be free from stalking. and two, the
03:31:31.840 claim that social media accounts dedicated to attacking an ex-friend constitute protected public discourse.
03:31:39.520 Both positions find no support in Utah law and would create dangerous precedents. I agree with that, by the
03:31:45.920 way, that if this was dismissed, if we didn't drop this,
03:31:52.239 the precedent here would have been unbelievable. Think about that. A small court in
03:31:59.520 Provo, Utah setting a precedent for all kids and adults to engage in unrestricted stalking under the guise of
03:32:06.800 free speech for the rest of their lives. The statutory language is clear and dis
03:32:12.399 dispositive. Utah code 76-5-106.5
03:32:17.520 explicitly prohibits communications quote to or about an individual. The
03:32:23.359 legislature did not limit the statute to direct contact. It deliberately included
03:32:28.479 or about to capture indirect harassment campaigns to or about.
03:32:34.960 She doesn't need to speak to you. She just needs to speak about you. Her attorney is actually specifically
03:32:40.640 left out about Yeah. on purpose, I'm sure. Yeah. Yeah. Grayson even noted it and
03:32:47.840 then so did her attorney. Yeah. Her attorneys left out some of the case law. Right. That was convenient. Let's just
03:32:54.479 leave out the case law. Respondents creation of multiple social media accounts posting 50 plus times about
03:32:59.920 petitioner over 6 months falls squarely within the statutory prohibition. Each of these 50 plus post represents a
03:33:06.640 deliberate choice to continue communicating about petitioner to third parties far exceeding the statutory
03:33:13.439 minimum of two acts required for a course of conduct. Utah's civil stalking statute protects all persons equally
03:33:20.640 regardless of their public profile or social media presence. The statute's inclusion of communication about
03:33:27.040 individuals demonstrates the legislaturator's clear intent to prevent exactly what respondent has done here.
03:33:34.080 Conduct an indirect harassment campaign through social media. To hold otherwise
03:33:39.120 would eviscerate stalking protections in the modern digital age and create an untenable legal president whereby anyone
03:33:45.920 with an online presence forfeits basic personal safety protection. The evidence
03:33:51.920 clearly establishes that respondent has engaged in a sustained campaign of harassment through multiple social media
03:33:58.720 platforms. This is not protected public discourse. It is targeted harassment using an
03:34:05.439 ex-friend as a thin veil for a personal vendetta. The first amendment prohibits
03:34:11.760 the first amendment protects robust public debate. It does not protect
03:34:17.120 weaponizing social media platforms to conduct harassment campaigns about individuals through dozens of posts over
03:34:24.399 months. The evidence before this court paints a disturbing picture of
03:34:29.680 calculated sustained harassment that has driven a professional journalist and mother to contemplate
03:34:37.200 respondents creation of accounts solely to expose her quote exfriend.
03:34:42.319 Her recruitment of others to join this campaign, her physical stalking across state lines, her bras in violation of
03:34:49.040 this court's injunction demonstrate conduct that no reasonable interpretation of law would protect
03:34:56.160 except Provo courts. Well, we don't know. We dropped.
03:35:01.200 Patricia Griffith summarized it best. quote, "Criticism of someone's work is one thing, but setting out to destroy a
03:35:07.920 person to incite fair and to threaten their livelihood is reprehensible, harmful, and flatout wrong."
03:35:14.640 Thank you, Trisha Griffith. Thank you, Wesley. The court must reject the respondent's attempt to weaponize
03:35:21.520 the First Amendment as a shield for what multiple witnesses, including a forensic psychologist, have identified as
03:35:28.239 dangerous stalking behavior with quote clear antisocial traits that significantly increase the risk of
03:35:35.040 harmful behavior in the future. We talked about that earlier in this show.
03:35:42.000 Those are the main points. So for those on the side of free speech at
03:35:47.920 any cost, that's what our attorney said. I want to
03:35:54.479 end with my book. Where's I know you got a lot of books. Which
03:35:59.920 book was over here? No, it's not. Is it this book under here? No, it's the
03:36:06.399 Oh, here it is. I got it.
03:36:12.640 All right. Here we are. How long has this been going on? Not nine hours.
03:36:18.160 Well, how many? Four hours. Four hours. All right. I thought it would be around three, but we far
03:36:23.359 exceeded that. Four hours. So, think about that. I'm less than half of your epic marathon.
03:36:31.279 Yeah.
03:36:39.920 I want to go back to this idea of a moral crusade and how important that was for this campaign
03:36:47.439 and I want to talk a little bit about so one of the things I've been doing is revisiting the Salem witch trials the
03:36:54.239 historical record and also Arthur Miller's interpretation in the crucible.
03:36:59.840 Okay.
03:37:08.000 I think there's no doubt that the Salem witch trials were a moral crusade because they were obviously
03:37:15.040 the community was engaged in a smear campaign against
03:37:21.520 specific individuals that they deemed to be witches. Of course, there were no such thing as witches. It was a moral
03:37:27.760 crusade because it was based in the puritanical
03:37:33.279 religious and spiritual worldview of the community.
03:37:39.120 So the basic idea was that
03:37:44.160 if you find witches that don't exist
03:37:49.920 that you purge them, you eliminate them. Right. And that's the same thing we saw in Dave, by the way.
03:37:55.600 Yeah. Group of people that called themselves the
03:38:02.640 They call themselves dark. Oh, the seven gatherers. Seven gatherers, right?
03:38:07.680 Which not ironically is the same label that this group uses to describe themselves.
03:38:18.800 Similar dynamics, but in the book,
03:38:25.439 this is the Penguin. This is the Penguin Classics version of The Crucible.
03:38:30.560 There's an introduction by a literary critic. His name is Christopher Bgsby.
03:38:36.560 BGsby does a brilliant job of summarizing the critical motivations in the
03:38:43.120 Crucible, also a moral crusade. 19 witches were hanged,
03:38:50.880 two dogs were killed, and one person was crushed to death during the Salem witch
03:38:56.800 trials in 1692. I'm going to read this line from the
03:39:02.160 critic because I think it's
03:39:08.720 absolutely relevant to this discussion and I think it's a good way to end in
03:39:14.239 thinking about all the motivations that this smear campaign involved. all the
03:39:21.840 all the people that believe they have the moral authority to vilify you and dehumanize you, right?
03:39:30.160 Just like they did in Salon, Massachusetts. Like, has the world really changed
03:39:36.560 in 350 years? Has the world really changed that much? I don't know. I don't know.
03:39:50.080 I'm going to read this.
03:39:58.560 In his hands, meaning Arthur Miller's hands, quote, this is from the introduction. Quote, "In Arthur Miller's
03:40:05.840 hands, the ghosts of those who died have proved real enough,
03:40:11.200 even if the witches they were presumed to be were little more than fantasies
03:40:17.680 conjured by a mixture of fear, ambition, frustration,
03:40:23.840 jealousy, and perverted pride."
03:40:30.000 That's exactly I couldn't say it better. Those
03:40:35.439 are exactly the motivations that fueled this smear campaign. Those
03:40:42.160 are the motivations that fueled
03:40:48.160 vilifying you, dehumanizing you.
03:40:53.760 Let me read it again. The witches were presumed to be little
03:40:59.279 more than fantasies conjured by a mixture of fear, ambition, frustration,
03:41:06.319 jealousy, and perverted pride. Why fear?
03:41:15.200 Why fear? Because I think you pose threats to people's identities. You pose threats
03:41:21.760 to their self-esteem. You may have posed threats to their businesses.
03:41:27.359 Not from anything you did. Say I didn't. Not from anything you did. Just from
03:41:33.439 from running our channel, from producing good art and good content, by getting
03:41:38.800 good interviews, by being a quality journalist, by being an ethical journalist, you created fear.
03:41:48.080 Ambition because all of these people were competitors. their ambition.
03:41:55.120 Their ambition to see you as a witch.
03:42:01.680 Frustration. This group was frustrated because they couldn't control you. This group
03:42:07.920 couldn't get you to conform. Jealousy.
03:42:14.880 Jealousy over the quality of your work. Nothing more. jealousy over the fact
03:42:19.920 that you were growing so rapidly.
03:42:25.600 Perverted pride. That's the pride to control the world.
03:42:32.800 The pride to dominate the world. The pride to control other people. The
03:42:39.760 pride to harass other people to control them. To intimidate them. And most importantly, and I'm gonna add with this
03:42:46.160 final thought, the pride to engage in a self-righteous
03:42:53.840 moral crusade against you
03:42:58.960 for no reason other than pure fantasy.
03:43:09.680 That's it. That's That's all you got. And I don't
03:43:15.840 really have a watch on. Um, thank you. Was it nine hours?
03:43:21.600 You did pretty good. It's a lot. Yeah, it was a lot. You didn't have to take a bathroom break. I did.
03:43:26.640 That's true. No, I took one. Okay, you did. Oh, so did I.
