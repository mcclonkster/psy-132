## What this topic covers

- How neurons communicate
- How the nervous system is organized
- How brain-behavior links are studied, with limits

::: notes
Visual cue: Three-part map: communication, organization, methods and limits.
:::

## The big idea

- Neurons use electrical signals within cells
- Neurons use chemical signals across synapses
- Brain functions rely on networks, not single centers

::: notes
Visual cue: Electrical within, chemical across, network-level outcome.
Guardrail: avoid one-region “emotion center” language.
:::

## Nervous system organization

```{mermaid}
flowchart TB
NS[Nervous system] --> CNS[Central nervous system]
NS --> PNS[Peripheral nervous system]
CNS --> B[Brain]
CNS --> S[Spinal cord]
PNS --> Som[Somatic]
PNS --> Aut[Autonomic]
Aut --> Sym[Sympathetic]
Aut --> Para[Parasympathetic]
```

::: notes
Teaching move: ask students to name one function for each branch.
:::

## Central nervous system

- Brain and spinal cord
- Integrates information
- Coordinates responses

::: notes
Visual cue: Simple brain and spinal cord diagram.
:::

## Peripheral nervous system

- Nerves outside the brain and spinal cord
- Carries signals to and from the CNS
- Divides into somatic and autonomic systems

::: notes
Visual cue: Body outline with peripheral nerves highlighted.
:::

## Somatic nervous system

- Sensation from body and environment
- Voluntary movement control
- Fast feedback for action

::: notes
Visual cue: Sensory input and motor output arrows.
:::

## Autonomic nervous system

- Regulates internal organs and glands
- Coordinates arousal and recovery
- Runs largely outside conscious control

::: notes
Visual cue: Organ regulation icons (heart, lungs) with “automatic regulation” label.
Guardrail: autonomic activity is regulated, not “random.”
:::

## Sympathetic and parasympathetic patterns

:::: columns
::: column
Sympathetic
- Mobilizes energy
- Increases readiness
- Supports action
:::

::: column
Parasympathetic
- Restores energy
- Supports digestion and recovery
- Supports calm states
:::
::::

::: notes
Visual cue: Two dials rather than a single on-off switch.
Guardrail: the systems can both be active to different degrees.
:::

## Neuron structure

- Dendrites receive input
- Axons send output
- Myelin increases signal speed

::: notes
Visual cue: Labeled neuron diagram.
:::

## Glial cells support neurons

- Support and protect neurons
- Help maintain healthy signaling
- Contribute to brain function over time

::: notes
Visual cue: Neuron surrounded by glial “support” cells.
:::

## Electrical signaling inside neurons

- Resting potential reflects charge difference
- Action potential is a rapid electrical change
- Signals travel along axons

::: notes
Visual cue: Spike traveling down an axon.
Keep it conceptual, not math-heavy.
:::

## Chemical signaling across synapses

- Synapses connect neurons
- Neurotransmitters bind to receptors
- Reuptake can reduce signaling

::: notes
Visual cue: Synapse diagram labeling neurotransmitter, receptor, reuptake.
Guardrail: neurotransmitters do not have one simple effect.
:::

## Neurotransmitters are pathway-dependent

- The same neurotransmitter can do different things
- Effects depend on receptor type and pathway
- Labels do not guarantee one simple outcome

::: notes
Visual cue: One neurotransmitter branching into multiple pathways.
Example to say aloud: dopamine and serotonin have multiple receptor types.
:::

## Plasticity

- The brain changes with experience
- Learning changes connections over time
- Recovery after injury can involve reorganization

::: notes
Visual cue: Timeline showing gradual change, not instant rewiring.
Guardrail: plasticity is change over time, not guaranteed improvement.
:::

## Networks over centers

- Many functions use distributed networks
- Connections matter as much as regions
- Single-center stories are usually misleading

::: notes
Visual cue: Network map with nodes and connections.
Teaching move: ask students to name a network-like function (language, attention).
:::

## Networks example: DMN, frontoparietal control, salience

- Default mode network (DMN): internal mode
- Frontoparietal or executive control network (FPN or CEN): control mode
- Salience network (SN): switching and priority
- Common pattern: DMN and control networks often show push-pull changes

::: notes
Keep this as "zoomed out coordination": not one region, not on-off, and not one network equals one behavior.
:::

## A simple three-network map

![](3DCF9646-2E78-4EFE-9FCC-8EBC0996B265.jpeg){fig-alt="Illustration of default mode, salience, and frontoparietal/executive control networks and dynamic switching."}

::: notes
Use as a picture for the claim: brain function is coordinated across networks.
Do not claim the figure proves causation; it illustrates a model based on observed patterns.
:::

## Hemispheric specialization is partial

- Some functions show division of labor
- Integration across hemispheres is extensive
- Specialization is not absolute

::: notes
Visual cue: Two hemispheres connected by thick communication lines.
Key example: split-brain findings illustrate partial specialization.
:::

## How we study brain and behavior

- Lesion evidence links damage to function
- Imaging measures structure or activity proxies
- Each method has strengths and limits

::: notes
Visual cue: Method cards labeled Lesion, EEG, MRI, fMRI, PET, CT.
Guardrail: methods are proxies, not direct “thought reading.”
:::

## EEG

- Measures electrical activity at the scalp
- Strong timing information
- Limited location precision

::: notes
Visual cue: Head cap with signal traces.
Keep comparison language: timing strong, location limited.
:::

## MRI and fMRI

- MRI measures structure
- fMRI estimates activity with a blood-oxygen proxy
- Stronger location than EEG, weaker timing than EEG

::: notes
Visual cue: Brain image card labeled structure and blood-oxygen proxy.
Guardrail: fMRI is an indirect measure of neural activity.
:::

## PET and CT

- PET measures metabolic activity with tracers
- CT measures structural images with X-rays
- Use depends on question and constraints

::: notes
Visual cue: PET as “metabolism proxy,” CT as “structure.”
Keep details minimal.
:::

## Interpreting evidence requires caution

- Correlation is not causation in imaging
- Strong claims require converging evidence
- Good interpretation states limits explicitly

::: notes
Visual cue: “Proxy” stamp on method cards plus a “converge” arrow from multiple methods.
:::

## Key evidence anchors

- Split-brain research: hemispheric communication
- Visual cortex research: feature detection
- Lesions and language: evidence and limits

::: notes
Use anchors as examples of inference, not as one-study proof.
Keep language network-based.
:::

## Quick check

Match the item to the best description

- Action potential
- Synapse
- Neurotransmitter
- Reuptake
- Somatic nervous system
- Autonomic nervous system
- Sympathetic division
- Parasympathetic division
- Neuroplasticity
- EEG
- fMRI

::: notes
Delivery: students commit first, then you reveal.
Use one discriminating cue per match.
:::

## Network quick check

In the three-network picture, the best match is

- A. DMN = control mode; frontoparietal network = internal mode; salience network = memory storage
- B. DMN = internal mode; frontoparietal network = control mode; salience network = switching and priority
- C. DMN = movement; frontoparietal network = hormones; salience network = reflexes
- D. All three are the same network

::: notes
Answer: B. Keep this brief; the goal is minimum coverage, not a deep dive.
:::

## Quick check answers

- Action potential: rapid electrical signal within a neuron
- Synapse: connection point where neurons communicate
- Neurotransmitter: chemical messenger across a synapse
- Reuptake: reabsorption that reduces neurotransmitter signaling
- Somatic nervous system: sensation and voluntary movement
- Autonomic nervous system: automatic organ regulation
- Sympathetic division: mobilizes energy and readiness
- Parasympathetic division: supports recovery and conservation
- Neuroplasticity: change in neural connections over time
- EEG: scalp electrical activity, strong timing
- fMRI: activity proxy using blood-oxygen changes, stronger location than EEG

::: notes
Keep it brief. Do not turn answers into re-lecture.
:::

## Bridge to Topic 7

- Neuroscience explains how signals travel through systems
- Sensation begins with transduction in sensory receptors
- Next: how stimuli become neural signals

::: notes
Visual cue: Stimulus → receptor → neural signal.

## In scope

- Basic nervous system organization: central nervous system and peripheral nervous system, including somatic and autonomic divisions.
- Sympathetic and parasympathetic patterns as coordinated regulation rather than simple on-off switches.
- Neuron structure and neural communication: action potentials, synapses, neurotransmitters, receptors, and reuptake at a course level.
- The idea that neurotransmitter effects depend on pathways and receptor types, not a single simple label.
- Brain functions as distributed networks rather than single centers, with cautious interpretation of localization.
- Neuroplasticity as change over time due to learning, development, and experience.
- How brain-behavior evidence is studied: lesions, EEG, MRI, fMRI, PET, CT, and the limits of inference from proxies and correlations.
- Hemispheric specialization as partial division of labor with extensive integration.

## Out of scope

- Detailed neuroanatomy of all brain regions and tracts beyond course-level examples and major divisions.
- Advanced electrophysiology, computational neuroscience, and detailed synaptic biochemistry.
- Clinical neurology and pharmacology beyond basic neurotransmission and the concept of agonists and antagonists at a course level.
- Medical diagnostic interpretation of imaging results and differential diagnosis of neurological disorders.
- Advanced neuroimaging analysis methods (preprocessing pipelines, statistical maps, connectivity modeling).
- Deterministic claims that brain measures can directly read thoughts, intentions, or truthfulness.

## Key concepts

- Neural communication: electrical signaling within neurons and chemical signaling across synapses
- Nervous system organization: CNS vs PNS; somatic vs autonomic; sympathetic vs parasympathetic
- Chemical signaling at two time scales: neurotransmitters (synapse-local) and hormones (bloodstream)
- Brain function as systems: networks and circuits; avoid single-center explanations
- Neuroplasticity: change in neural connections over time
- Evidence tools and limits: lesion evidence and brain measurement methods are informative but indirect
- Hemispheric specialization: partial division of labor with extensive integration

## Examples

- A simple brain–behavior pathway claim with bounded language, such as “sleep deprivation can impair attention”
- A simple example of biological influence on behavior that is not destiny, such as stress physiology influencing coping without guaranteeing outcomes
- A simple example of why “brain region name” is not a complete explanation

## Misconceptions

- One brain region fully explains a complex behavior or mental process.
- Brain images show thoughts directly rather than proxies measured under assumptions.
- fMRI measures neural activity directly.
- Correlation in brain data proves causation.
- Neurotransmitters have one simple effect, such as dopamine equals pleasure or serotonin equals happiness.
- Chemical imbalance is a complete explanation for behavior or mental health.
- Left-brain versus right-brain types explain personality and intelligence.
- Autonomic nervous system is an on-off switch between sympathetic and parasympathetic states.
- Neuroplasticity means the brain can become anything instantly with enough willpower.
- Neuroscience explanations make psychological and social explanations unnecessary.

## Corrective frames

- Emphasize that complex behavior is supported by networks, and region labels are partial descriptions rather than complete explanations.
- Emphasize that imaging measures are proxies, and interpretation requires stating what was measured and what the method cannot show.
- Emphasize that fMRI estimates activity using blood-oxygen changes and has timing and inference limits.
- Emphasize that brain-behavior relationships often require converging evidence from multiple methods, not a single correlation.
- Emphasize that neurotransmitters act in multiple pathways with multiple receptor types, so effects depend on where and how signaling occurs.
- Emphasize that biological contributions are probabilistic and interact with learning, cognition, and context, rather than replacing them.
- Emphasize that hemispheric specialization is partial and that most tasks require coordinated activity across hemispheres.
- Emphasize that sympathetic and parasympathetic systems can both be active and are regulated dynamically, not switched like a toggle.
- Emphasize that neuroplasticity reflects change over time and involves constraints, costs, and context, not instant unlimited flexibility.

## Retrieval practice prompts

- Match each nervous system division to its core function: CNS, PNS, somatic, autonomic, sympathetic, parasympathetic.
- Explain the difference between electrical signaling within neurons and chemical signaling across synapses.
- Given a neurotransmitter claim, rewrite it to include pathway and receptor dependence.
- Identify which method best fits a question: EEG, MRI, fMRI, PET, CT, lesion evidence, and state one key limitation.
- Given an imaging headline, identify whether it is correlational and state what additional evidence would strengthen causal language.
- Explain neuroplasticity in two sentences and name one example of change over time.
- Decide whether a statement is an overlocalization error and rewrite it using network-based language.
- Compare sympathetic and parasympathetic patterns by describing one function of each without using on-off language.
- Given a short vignette, propose one biological, one cognitive, and one social-context factor that could contribute, and state how they might interact.
- Match key terms to definitions: action potential, synapse, receptor, reuptake, agonist, antagonist.

## Inclusive language guidelines

- Avoid deterministic language that implies biology fixes outcomes; use probabilistic phrasing and acknowledge interaction with experience and context.
- Avoid stigmatizing mental health explanations as purely biological or as personal weakness; keep claims evidence-based and context-aware.
- Avoid brain-based stereotypes about groups; do not use neuroscience to imply inherent superiority or inferiority.
- When discussing gender or cultural examples, avoid treating any group as the default brain or default experience.
- Use person-first language for disability and neurological conditions when examples are used.
- Avoid sensational claims about mind reading, lie detection, or 'brain scans prove' language; emphasize method limits.
