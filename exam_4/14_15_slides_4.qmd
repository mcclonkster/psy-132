# Slides – Psychological Disorders and Treatment

## Understanding Psychological Disorders

### Why This Topic Matters

- **Psychological disorders** can disrupt school, work, relationships, and health.
- Many people you know have been affected by these problems, directly or indirectly.
- Psychology uses **research** to understand these problems and to find ways to reduce suffering and improve functioning.

::: notes
Goal: motivate and humanize the topic.

- Emphasize prevalence and impact without sensationalizing.
- Connect to students’ real worlds: “Most of you either have struggled with this or know someone who has.”
- Set expectations: this unit is about understanding and using evidence, not casually diagnosing people.
:::


### What We Mean by Psychopathology

- **Psychopathology** is the scientific study of mental, emotional, and behavioral disorders.
- A **psychological disorder** is a pattern of thoughts, feelings, or behaviors that:
  - Causes significant **distress** to the person, and/or
  - **Interferes** with daily life (work, school, relationships, self-care).
- Not every unpleasant feeling or hard week meets this definition.

::: notes
This slide anchors the basic vocabulary.

- Keep the distinction clear:
  - Psychopathology = field of study.
  - Psychological disorder = the condition itself.
- Stress the role of impairment and distress as central parts of the definition.
:::


### Clues for Judging Abnormal Behavior

- When we ask “Is this abnormal?” psychologists consider four **clues**:
  - **Statistical abnormality** – is it very rare compared to most people?
  - **Social nonconformity** – does it seriously violate social norms or expectations?
  - **Subjective discomfort** – does it cause intense, ongoing emotional pain?
  - **Maladaptive behavior** – does it seriously interfere with daily functioning?

::: notes
Map directly to 14.1.

- Keep one idea per bullet but include the textbook term and a short gloss.
- You can quickly illustrate each with a short example:
  - Statistical abnormality: extremely high depression scores.
  - Social nonconformity: grossly inappropriate public behavior.
  - Subjective discomfort: feeling tormented by intrusive thoughts.
  - Maladaptive behavior: unable to maintain hygiene or work.
:::


### Using the Four Clues

- These four clues are **guides**, not strict rules.
- A **psychological disorder** usually involves:
  - More than one clue at the same time.
  - Especially **subjective discomfort** and **maladaptive behavior**.
- We always consider **context**, **severity**, **duration**, and **impact** before using a diagnostic label.

::: notes
Clarify how the clues are used, not just listed.

- Emphasize that a single unusual behavior is not enough to call something a disorder.
- Use the questions from your notes:
  - How severe is it?
  - How long has it lasted?
  - How much does it interfere with work, school, relationships, self-care?
:::


### DSM-5 and Diagnosis

- Psychological problems are classified using the **DSM-5** (*Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition*).
- A **diagnosis** is given when a person’s symptoms match the **criteria** for a specific disorder in the DSM-5.
- People can be **comorbid**, meaning they meet criteria for more than one disorder at the same time.

::: notes
Direct tie to 14.1 “How disorders are classified and diagnosed.”

- Explain that DSM-5 is a shared reference manual used by mental health professionals.
- “Criteria” are specific symptom lists and time frames (e.g., number of symptoms, duration).
- Stress that comorbidity is common (for example, depression + anxiety, or substance use + another disorder).
:::


### Symptom Types and Revisions

- DSM-5 describes symptoms in terms of:
  - **Positive symptoms** – behaviors or experiences that are “added” (for example, hallucinations, delusions).
  - **Negative symptoms** – losses or deficits (for example, flat affect, lack of speech).
- DSM categories are **revised over time** as research and social norms change.
  - New disorders can be added.
  - Criteria for existing disorders can be changed or removed.

::: notes
Finish the classification picture.

- Use schizophrenia as an example of a disorder with positive and negative symptoms.
- Give one quick historical note (e.g., homosexuality was once in DSM, now removed) to show that DSM is a practical, evolving system, not a fixed list of “natural kinds.”
:::


### Causes: The Biopsychosocial Model

- The **biopsychosocial model** says that mental disorders arise from:
  - **Biological factors** such as genetics, brain structure and chemistry, and physical illness.
  - **Psychological factors** such as learning history, thoughts, coping skills, and personality.
  - **Social and cultural factors** such as relationships, family environment, culture, trauma, and stress.
- No single factor explains most disorders; different factors interact over time.

::: notes
Map directly to the “Causes” subsection.

- You can draw a simple three-part diagram on the board or show a Venn diagram if you like.
- Stress that this model helps avoid oversimplified explanations like “it’s just genetic” or “it’s just bad choices.”
:::


### Causes: The Diathesis–Stress Idea

- The **diathesis–stress model** is one way to apply the biopsychosocial approach.
- **Diathesis** means a vulnerability or predisposition (for example, genetic risk or early-life experiences).
- **Stress** means life events and ongoing pressures (for example, trauma, loss, chronic stress).
- A disorder often develops when a **vulnerable person** experiences enough **stress**.

::: notes
Conclude 14.1 with a clear, simple version of diathesis–stress.

- Use a straightforward example:
  - A person with a family history of depression (diathesis) who faces major losses and high stress (stress).
- Emphasize: diathesis–stress is not blaming the person; it describes how risk and environment work together.
:::


## Psychotic Disorders

### What Psychotic Disorders Have in Common

- **Psychotic disorders** involve a loss of contact with **reality**.
- People with psychotic symptoms may:
  - Have **hallucinations**, such as hearing voices that are not really there.
  - Have **delusions**, such as believing they are being plotted against without evidence.
  - Show **disorganized thinking or speech**, making their ideas hard to follow.

::: notes
Based on 14.2.

- Clarify the difference between hallucinations and illusions if needed.
- Explain that these symptoms can be very distressing and disruptive, and they can appear in several different disorders.
:::


### Delusional Disorders and Schizophrenia

- **Delusional disorders** are marked mainly by strong, false beliefs that persist despite clear evidence to the contrary.
- **Schizophrenia** often includes:
  - **Hallucinations** and **delusions**.
  - **Disorganized thought and speech**.
  - **Negative symptoms** such as reduced emotional expression or lack of motivation.
- Schizophrenia is typically long-term and can be very disabling, but treatment can help many people.

::: notes
Keep this slide tightly tied to 16e’s 14.2 section.

- Make clear that delusional disorder focuses more narrowly on delusions, whereas schizophrenia involves a broader set of symptoms.
- Avoid over-detailing subtypes; focus on the core pattern.
:::


## Mood and Personality Disorders

### Mood Disorders

- **Mood disorders** involve major disturbances in **emotion**.
- **Depressive disorders** may include:
  - Persistent low mood and loss of interest.
  - Changes in sleep and appetite and low energy.
  - Feelings of worthlessness or guilt and possible thoughts of death or suicide.
- **Bipolar and related disorders** involve shifts between:
  - **Depressive episodes** and
  - **Manic or hypomanic episodes** with elevated mood, high energy, and impulsive behavior.

::: notes
Based on 14.3.

- Differentiate depression from ordinary sadness by duration, severity, and impairment.
- Define **mania** and **hypomania** in simple terms (energy, mood, sleep, risk).
- Emphasize that mood disorders can be treated and that many people improve with help.
:::


### Personality Disorders

- **Personality disorders** involve long-standing patterns of:
  - Thinking.
  - Feeling.
  - Behaving.
- These patterns are:
  - **Inflexible** across many situations.
  - Cause significant **distress** or **impairment** in life.
- Examples include enduring patterns of:
  - Distrust of others.
  - Instability in relationships and self-image.
  - Strong need for admiration with low empathy.

::: notes
Stay high-level; you do not need to name each specific diagnosis here.

- Make clear that personality disorders are not “bad personality,” but long-term patterns that cause problems for the person and others.
- Emphasize that change is possible but often slower and more complex than for some other disorders.
:::


## Anxiety and Related Disorders

### Anxiety Disorders

- **Anxiety disorders** feature excessive, unrealistic **fear** or **anxiety** that interferes with functioning.
- Examples include:
  - **Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD):** chronic, widespread worry about many aspects of life.
  - **Panic disorder:** repeated panic attacks and persistent concern about having more.
  - **Specific phobias:** intense, irrational fear of particular objects or situations (for example, heights, animals).

::: notes
Use 14.4’s anxiety examples.

- Tie back to the earlier criteria: subjective discomfort and maladaptive behavior are central here.
- Clarify that everyone feels anxiety; these disorders involve anxiety that is more intense, longer-lasting, and more interfering.
:::


### Anxiety-Related Disorders

- Some conditions share anxiety features but are classified separately in DSM-5.
- Examples include:
  - **Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD):** recurring unwanted thoughts and repetitive behaviors done to reduce anxiety.
  - **Trauma- and stressor-related disorders** such as **PTSD**:
    - Intrusive memories and nightmares.
    - Avoidance of reminders.
    - Feeling constantly “on guard” or easily startled.

::: notes
Continue from 14.4.

- For OCD, highlight the cycle between obsessions and compulsions.
- For PTSD, emphasize the link to trauma and the characteristic symptom clusters.
:::


## Perseverance and Skill Set

### Perseverance and Recovery

- The textbook highlights **perseverance** as an important skill in mental health.
- Perseverance means continuing to work toward goals despite obstacles and setbacks.
- Sticking with treatment and coping strategies over time is important for recovery.

::: notes
Use 14.5.

- Connect perseverance to real-life challenges: returning to class, rebuilding routines, practicing skills even when motivation is low.
- Encourage students to think about how patience and persistence apply to their own challenges, not just to formal treatment.
:::


# Chapter 15 – Therapies

## Understanding Therapies

### What Is Psychotherapy?

- **Psychotherapy** is a professional relationship focused on helping people change thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.
- Different approaches grew out of:
  - **Psychoanalysis** (Freud and later psychodynamic therapies).
  - **Learning theory** (behavior therapies).
  - **Cognitive and humanistic** perspectives.

::: notes
Based on 15.1.

- Provide a quick historical overview without going deep into dates.
- Emphasize that all psychotherapies are structured, intentional efforts to improve mental health, not just “talking.”
:::


### How Therapies Differ

- Psychotherapies can be described along several dimensions:
  - **Insight vs action:** understanding vs changing behavior and thoughts.
  - **Directive vs nondirective:** therapist-led vs client-led work.
  - **Open-ended vs time-limited:** flexible duration vs set number of sessions.
- Therapy can be:
  - Individual or group.
  - In-person or remote.

::: notes
Tie directly to the “four characteristics” in 15.1.

- Clarify each dimension with simple examples:
  - Insight: exploring past and feelings.
  - Action: practicing new skills.
  - Directive: therapist gives homework.
  - Nondirective: therapist mainly listens and reflects.
:::


## Behavior Therapies

### Behavior Therapies

- **Behavior therapies** focus on **changing maladaptive behavior** using learning principles.
- They apply:
  - **Classical conditioning** to change responses to stimuli.
  - **Operant conditioning** to change the consequences that follow behavior.
- They emphasize behavior change and skill-building more than deep “insight.”

::: notes
Based on 15.2.

- Give one or two concise illustrations of classical and operant approaches, but keep the details for discussion or later slides if needed.
:::


### Classical Conditioning Techniques

- Behavior therapies based on classical conditioning include:
  - **Aversion therapy:** pairing an unwanted behavior with something unpleasant to reduce it.
  - **Exposure therapies:** safely facing feared situations or cues to reduce anxiety over time.
    - **Flooding:** facing the fear all at once.
    - **Systematic desensitization:** gradual exposure paired with relaxation.
    - **Modeling:** observing others confronting fears.

::: notes
Pull directly from 15.2.

- Emphasize that these approaches aim to weaken learned associations that maintain fear or unwanted behavior.
:::


### Operant Conditioning Techniques

- Behavior therapies based on operant conditioning:
  - Use **reinforcement** to increase desired behaviors.
  - Use **extinction** or mild consequences to reduce undesired behaviors.
- Tools include:
  - Rewarding positive behaviors.
  - Removing rewards for problem behaviors.
  - **Token economies** and **time-out** procedures.
  - **Intensive behavioral intervention (IBI)** in structured programs.

::: notes
Continue from 15.2.

- Mention that token economies and IBI are often used in schools and with children with autism, but similar ideas show up in everyday behavior plans.
:::


## Cognitive and Humanistic Therapies

### Cognitive Therapies

- **Cognitive therapies** focus on changing **distorted thinking** and teaching coping skills.
- Key approaches:
  - **Beck’s cognitive therapy:** targets patterns like “all-or-nothing” thinking and overgeneralization.
  - **Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT):** integrates cognitive and behavioral methods.
  - **Rational-emotive behavior therapy (REBT):** helps clients identify and replace rigid “musts” and “shoulds.”

::: notes
Use 15.3.

- Emphasize that cognitive therapies help clients examine the accuracy and helpfulness of their thoughts.
- Note that CBT is one of the most widely studied and used therapies.
:::


### Humanistic Therapies

- **Humanistic therapies** are **insight-oriented** and emphasize:
  - Personal growth and self-acceptance.
  - Finding meaning and purpose.
- Common elements:
  - Seeing the client as basically good and capable of growth.
  - Providing warmth, empathy, and genuine respect.
  - Letting the client lead exploration while the therapist supports and reflects.

::: notes
Based on 15.3.

- You can highlight client-centered therapy as a key example.
- Stress the importance of the therapeutic relationship in humanistic approaches.
:::


## Medical Treatments and Systems

### Medical Therapies

- **Pharmacotherapy (medications)** uses drugs to change brain chemistry and reduce symptoms.
  - Examples: antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, antianxiety drugs.
- **Brain stimulation therapies** (for example, ECT) may be used for severe, treatment-resistant conditions.
- **Psychosurgery** is rare and reserved for extreme cases when other treatments have failed.

::: notes
Pull from 15.4.

- Emphasize that medications can be very helpful for some conditions but are not magic cures.
- Explain that ECT is typically used for severe depression that has not responded to other treatments.
- Note that psychosurgery is now highly uncommon and tightly regulated.
:::


### Hospitalization and Community Mental Health

- **Hospitalization** provides:
  - A safe, structured setting for people in crisis.
  - Short-term intensive treatment when safety is a concern.
- **Community mental health centers** aim to:
  - Prevent or reduce the need for hospitalization.
  - Offer services such as education, consultation, crisis intervention, and ongoing support.

::: notes
Continue from 15.4.

- Explain typical reasons for hospitalization (suicidal intent, severe psychosis).
- Emphasize that community programs help people live in their communities with support rather than in long-term institutions.
:::


## Ethics, Skills, and Stigma

### Ethics in Mental Health Practice

- Ethical practice protects:
  - **Safety**
  - **Rights**
  - **Dignity**
- Key principles:
  - **Confidentiality** – keeping client information private with defined exceptions.
  - **Informed consent** – clients know what treatment involves and agree voluntarily.
  - **Professional boundaries** – maintaining a helpful, non-exploitative relationship.
  - **Cultural responsiveness** – respecting clients’ backgrounds and values.

::: notes
Align with your ethics section.

- Use simple examples to illustrate each principle.
- Stress that ethics are part of every step of assessment and treatment, not separate content.
:::


### Perseverance and Managing Mental Health

- Change is often **slow** and uneven.
- **Perseverance** means continuing to work toward mental health goals despite setbacks.
- You can build skills to:
  - Support your own mental health.
  - Support others in seeking and staying in treatment.

::: notes
Use 14.5 and 15.5.

- Encourage realistic expectations about recovery.
- Connect perseverance to sticking with therapy, using coping skills consistently, and seeking help when needed.
:::


### Stigma, Culture, and Evidence

- **Stigma** can:
  - Make people less likely to seek or continue treatment.
  - Increase shame and isolation.
  - Contribute to discrimination in work, school, and relationships.
- Culture and identity influence:
  - How distress is expressed and understood.
  - How behavior is interpreted by others.
  - How much people trust mental health systems.
- **Research evidence** helps:
  - Correct myths (for example, most people with mental illness are not violent).
  - Support more fair and compassionate attitudes.

::: notes
Use your access, equity, and stigma notes.

- Identify common myths (“people with mental illness are dangerous,” “therapy never works,” “getting help is weakness”) and gently correct them with data.
- Emphasize that science can support more accurate and humane views of mental illness.
:::


# Chapter 14 – Psychological Disorders

## Student Notes (16e-faithful, aligned with our Block 8 plan)

## 14.1 Psychopathology: Classification and Causes

**Psychopathology** is the study of mental, behavioral, and emotional disorders.

### Four things to consider when deciding whether behavior is abnormal

The textbook identifies four key ideas to think about when deciding if behavior is abnormal:

1. **Statistical abnormality**
   - Behavior is rare or falls far from the average.
   - Example: very extreme scores on a depression scale compared to most people.

2. **Nonconformity (social nonconformity)**
   - Behavior seriously violates social norms or expectations.
   - Example: acting in ways that are grossly inappropriate for the situation, such as shouting at strangers in a quiet library.

3. **Subjective discomfort**
   - The person feels intense, ongoing emotional pain or distress about their own thoughts or behavior.
   - Example: someone feels tormented by constant, unwanted intrusive thoughts.

4. **Maladaptive behavior**
   - The behavior seriously interferes with a person’s ability to function (work, school, relationships, self-care).
   - Example: someone who stops going to work, cannot maintain hygiene, or cannot manage daily tasks because of their symptoms.

**Key points:**

- These four ideas are guides, not strict rules.
- A psychological disorder usually involves more than one of these, especially subjective discomfort and maladaptive behavior.

### How disorders are classified and diagnosed

- Psychological problems are classified using the **Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)**.
- A **diagnosis** is made by checking which symptoms are present and which are absent, and seeing if they match the **criteria** for a particular disorder.
- People can be **comorbid**, meaning they show symptoms that fit criteria for more than one disorder at the same time.
- DSM categories are revised over time as research and social norms change; categories can be added, changed, or removed.

The DSM describes symptoms in terms of:

- **Positive symptoms** – behaviors or experiences that are more than normal (for example, hallucinations, delusions).
- **Negative symptoms** – losses or deficits compared to normal (for example, flat affect, lack of speech).

### Causes of mental illness and the biopsychosocial model

The chapter emphasizes the **biopsychosocial model**:

- **Biological factors:** genetics, brain structure and chemistry, physical illness.
- **Psychological factors:** learning history, thoughts, coping skills, personality.
- **Social and cultural factors:** relationships, family environment, culture, life stress, trauma, socioeconomic conditions.

The **diathesis–stress** idea fits here: people may have a predisposition (diathesis) that, combined with stress, leads to a disorder.

---

## 14.2 Psychotic Disorders

Psychotic disorders involve a loss of contact with reality.

- **Delusional disorders**
  - Main feature: strong, false beliefs that are not shared by others and persist despite evidence to the contrary.
  - Example: believing you are being plotted against without any real proof.
- **Schizophrenia**
  - Often involves:
    - Hallucinations (most often hearing voices).
    - Delusions (paranoid or grandiose beliefs).
    - Disorganized thought and speech.
    - Negative symptoms such as reduced emotional expression or lack of motivation.
  - Typically long-term and can be very disabling, but treatment can help many people.

---

## 14.3 Mood and Personality Disorders

### Mood disorders

Mood disorders involve major disturbances in emotion, such as long-lasting sadness or extreme swings.

- **Depressive disorders**
  - Persistent low mood, loss of interest, changes in sleep and appetite, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness, possible thoughts of death or suicide.
- **Bipolar and related disorders**
  - Shifts between depression and **mania** or **hypomania**:
    - Elevated mood.
    - Increased energy.
    - Decreased need for sleep.
    - Racing thoughts.
    - Impulsive or risky behavior.

### Personality disorders

- Long-standing patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving that:
  - Are inflexible across situations.
  - Cause significant distress or impairment.
- Examples include enduring patterns of:
  - Distrust.
  - Instability in relationships and self-image.
  - Strong need for admiration with lack of empathy.

---

## 14.4 Anxiety and Anxiety-Related Disorders

### Anxiety disorders

- Feature excessive, unrealistic fear or anxiety that interferes with functioning.

**Examples:**

- **Generalized anxiety disorder:** chronic, widespread worry about many aspects of life.
- **Panic disorder:** repeated panic attacks and persistent concern about having more.
- **Phobias:** intense, irrational fear of specific objects or situations (for example, heights, animals).

### Anxiety-related disorders

These conditions share anxiety features but are classified separately in DSM-5.

**Examples include:**

- **Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD):** recurring unwanted thoughts and repetitive behaviors done to reduce anxiety.
- **Trauma- and stressor-related disorders** such as **PTSD**:
  - Intrusive memories.
  - Nightmares.
  - Avoidance.
  - Hyperarousal following trauma.

---

## 14.5 Psychology and Your Skill Set: Perseverance

This section focuses on **perseverance**, often discussed in terms of “grit”:

- Perseverance means continuing to work toward goals despite obstacles and setbacks.
- The text highlights how sticking with treatment and coping strategies over time is important for recovery.
- Students are encouraged to:
  - Recognize that change can be slow.
  - Practice balancing persistence with self-care.
  - Think about how to apply these ideas to their own challenges.

## 15.1 The Origins and Effectiveness of Psychotherapy

### A brief history of psychotherapy

- Early roots in **psychoanalysis** (Freud): talking about thoughts, dreams, and childhood experiences to uncover unconscious conflicts.
- Later developments include:
  - **Behavior therapies** (influenced by learning theory).
  - **Cognitive therapies** (focused on thought patterns).
  - **Humanistic therapies** (focused on growth and self-acceptance).

### Four characteristics that distinguish psychotherapies

Psychotherapies can be described along these dimensions:

- **Insight-oriented vs action-oriented**
  - Insight-oriented: focus on understanding thoughts and feelings (for example, psychodynamic, humanistic).
  - Action-oriented: focus on changing behaviors and thoughts directly (for example, behavioral, cognitive-behavioral).
- **Directive vs nondirective**
  - Directive: therapist takes an active role in guiding the client, giving advice, or assigning tasks.
  - Nondirective: therapist mainly reflects and supports, letting the client lead.
- **Open-ended vs time-limited**
  - Open-ended: duration is flexible.
  - Time-limited: set number of sessions.
- **Individual vs group; in-person vs remote**
  - Therapy can be one-on-one, in a group, or with couples/families.
  - It can be delivered face-to-face or via phone/Internet.

### Core features of effective psychotherapy

The effectiveness of therapy depends on:

- **Client characteristics**
  - Motivation, expectations, and resources.
- **Therapist characteristics**
  - Warmth, empathy, experience, cultural competence.
- **Therapeutic alliance**
  - The quality of the working relationship and mutual trust between client and therapist.
- **Nature of the problem**
  - Some problems respond better to certain approaches than others.

Overall, research shows that psychotherapy is often more helpful than no treatment at all across many problems.

---

## 15.2 Behavior Therapies

Behavior therapies focus on **changing maladaptive behavior**, often using principles of conditioning.

### Main elements of behavior therapies

- Behavior therapists apply **classical** and **operant conditioning** to directly change problematic behaviors and thoughts.
- They emphasize behavior change and skill-building more than deep “insight.”

### Therapies based on classical conditioning

- **Aversion therapy**
  - Pairs an unwanted behavior (for example, heavy drinking) with something unpleasant to reduce that behavior.
- **Exposure therapies**
  - Help people face feared situations or cues safely, to reduce anxiety over time.
  - Types include:
    - **Flooding:** facing the fear all at once.
    - **Systematic desensitization:** gradual exposure paired with relaxation.
    - **Modeling:** observing others confronting fears.

These techniques aim to weaken learned fear responses.

### Therapies based on operant conditioning

- Use **reinforcement** and other consequences to reduce undesired behaviors and increase desired ones.

**Tools include:**

- Positive reinforcement: rewarding desirable behaviors.
- Non-reinforcement and extinction: removing rewards to reduce unwanted behaviors.
- Punishment: adding unpleasant consequences to discourage behavior (used carefully).
- Shaping: reinforcing small steps toward a desired behavior.
- Stimulus control: managing cues that trigger behaviors.
- Time-out: removing access to reinforcement after misbehavior.

**Examples:**

- **Token economies:** people earn tokens for positive behaviors and exchange them for rewards.
- **Intensive behavioral intervention (IBI):** structured behavioral programs, often used with children with autism.

---

## 15.3 Cognitive and Humanistic Therapies

### Cognitive therapies

Cognitive therapies focus on **distorted thinking** and teach coping skills.

**Key approaches:**

- **Beck’s cognitive therapy**
  - Targets patterns like selective perception (only seeing the negative), overgeneralization, and all-or-nothing thinking.
  - Helps clients identify and change these thought patterns.
- **Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)**
  - Integrates cognitive and behavioral methods.
  - Clients learn to challenge distorted thoughts and test new behaviors.
- **Rational-emotive behavior therapy (REBT)**
  - Trains clients to identify irrational beliefs (“musts,” “shoulds”) and replace them with more realistic, flexible thoughts.

Overall, cognitive therapies aim to modify the thoughts that fuel distress and to build more effective coping.

### Humanistic therapies

Humanistic therapies are **insight-oriented**:

- They help clients gain deeper understanding of their own thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.
- Emphasize personal growth, self-acceptance, and finding meaning.

**Common elements:**

- Seeing the client as basically good and capable of growth.
- Providing warmth, empathy, and genuine respect.
- Letting the client lead the exploration while the therapist offers support and reflection.

---

## 15.4 Medical Therapies

### Main types of medical therapies

- **Pharmacotherapy (medications)**
  - Use of drugs (for example, antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers) to change brain chemistry and reduce symptoms.
- **Brain stimulation therapies**
  - Methods like electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), used especially for severe depression that has not responded to other treatments.
- **Psychosurgery**
  - Rare surgical procedures on the brain for severe conditions that do not respond to other treatments; much less common now and tightly controlled.

### Hospitalization and community mental health programs

- **Hospitalization**
  - Provides a protected setting for intensive treatment when there is serious risk (for example, suicidal intent, severe psychosis).
- **Community mental health centers**
  - Aim to prevent or reduce the need for hospitalization.
  - Offer services like education, consultation, crisis intervention, and ongoing support in the community.

---

## 15.5 Psychology and Your Skill Set: Managing Mental Health Issues

This section emphasizes **skills** for dealing with mental health problems in everyday life.

### Key ideas include:

- **Basic counseling skills**
  - Listening carefully, showing empathy, and avoiding judgment when someone shares their struggles.
  - Knowing how to encourage someone to seek professional help when needed.
- **Getting counseling**
  - Understanding that seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness.
  - Knowing steps to find support (talking to a trusted adult, contacting a counseling center, exploring community resources).

**The message:**

- Many psychological problems can be helped.
- You can play a role in supporting others and in getting help for yourself when you need it.
