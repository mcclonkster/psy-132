## 14.1 – Foundations: Psychopathology, Classification, and Causes

### 1. What is a psychological disorder?
A psychological disorder is a serious problem in how a person thinks, feels, or behaves.
It is not just a bad day or a rough week.
It causes real trouble in everyday life, like school, work, or relationships.

---

### 2. How do psychologists decide if something is “abnormal”?
Psychologists look at several things at once when they decide if behavior is abnormal.
They ask: Is this behavior very rare? Does it break important social rules?
They also ask: Is the person very upset by it, and does it get in the way of daily life?

### 3. What is the stress–vulnerability model?
People are born with different levels of risk for mental health problems.
Life stress, like loss, conflict, or trauma, can push those risks higher.
A disorder is more likely when someone’s built-in risk and life stress together are more than they can cope with.

---

### 4. What does “psychopathology” mean?
Psychopathology is the scientific study of mental disorders.
It also refers to the unhealthy patterns of thoughts, feelings, and behavior seen in those disorders.
It is a technical word, not an insult.

---

### 5. What is the DSM-5?
The DSM-5 is a big reference book that mental health professionals use.
It gives shared rules and detailed descriptions for many mental disorders.
This helps different clinicians use the same names and mean the same thing.

---

### 6. Why can labels sometimes be a problem?
A diagnosis can help people get care and understand what is happening.
But labels can also create stigma and make others see only the disorder, not the person.
Sometimes normal differences in behavior can be mistaken for a disorder if we rely too much on labels.

---

### 7. What are culture-bound syndromes?
People in different cultures may show distress in different ways.
Culture-bound syndromes are patterns of distress and behavior that mostly appear in certain cultures.
They do not always fit neatly into the standard DSM categories.

---

### 8. How has diagnosis changed over time?
In the past, the DSM included ideas that we now see as wrong or harmful.
For example, it once listed homosexuality as a mental disorder, and it used vague terms like “neurosis.”
As research and social values changed, these were removed from the manual.

---

### 9. What is the biopsychosocial perspective?
The biopsychosocial perspective says that mental disorders almost never have just one cause.
Biological factors (like genes or brain chemistry), psychological factors (like beliefs or coping skills), and social factors (like stress or support) all work together.
To understand or treat a disorder well, we have to consider all three.

## 14.2 – Psychotic Disorders

### 1. What is a psychotic disorder?
A psychotic disorder is a serious problem with thinking and perception.
A person with a psychotic disorder has a hard time telling what is real and what is not.
This is more than being confused or stressed; it is a major break from reality.

---

### 2. What are hallucinations and delusions?
Hallucinations are experiences, like hearing voices, that feel real even though nothing outside the person is causing them.
Delusions are strong false beliefs, like thinking others are plotting against you or that you have special powers, even when there is clear evidence you are wrong.
Both hallucinations and delusions are key signs of psychosis.

---

### 3. What is schizophrenia?
Schizophrenia is a long-lasting psychotic disorder that seriously disrupts a person’s thoughts, feelings, perceptions, behavior, and daily life.
It is not just being “odd” or “different”; it is a serious mental disorder that makes everyday functioning much harder.
Schizophrenia is one of the main examples of a psychotic disorder.

---

### 4. What are positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms?
Positive symptoms are added experiences, such as hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech, and very odd behavior.
Negative symptoms are losses of normal abilities, such as showing little emotion, speaking very little, lacking motivation, and pulling away from people.
Many people with schizophrenia also have thinking problems, such as trouble paying attention, keeping information in mind, and planning ahead.

---

### 5. How common is schizophrenia, and when does it start?
Schizophrenia affects about one out of every one hundred people.
It usually begins in the late teen years or early adult life.
For many people, symptoms come and go in episodes, with periods of partial recovery in between.

---

### 6. What do we know about biological risk?
Schizophrenia is more likely in close relatives, especially identical twins, which supports a biological risk for the disorder.
Research also links schizophrenia to differences in brain structure and chemistry, including changes in some dopamine pathways and other neurotransmitter systems.
These findings suggest that biology matters, but they do not mean biology is the only cause.

---

### 7. How does stress–vulnerability apply to schizophrenia?
The stress–vulnerability model says that biological risks make schizophrenia more likely, but life stresses and social conditions help decide whether and when symptoms appear.
Stressful events, conflict, or lack of support can push a vulnerable person closer to an episode.
High levels of family conflict, criticism, and overinvolvement can increase stress and make future symptom episodes more likely.

---

### 8. What other psychotic disorders are there?
Delusional disorder is a condition in which a person has long-lasting, well-organized delusions but otherwise functions fairly normally.
Brief psychotic disorder is a sudden, short-term episode of psychotic symptoms, usually after extreme stress, that lasts less than a month.
Schizoaffective disorder includes symptoms of schizophrenia along with strong mood episodes such as major depression or mania.

---

### 9. What are common myths and realities about schizophrenia?
Schizophrenia is not a "split personality"; that term refers to dissociative identity disorder, which is a different condition.
Most people with schizophrenia are not violent and are more likely to be harmed by others than to harm other people.
Although schizophrenia can be very disabling, many people improve with medicine, therapy, and social support and can live more stable, satisfying lives.
