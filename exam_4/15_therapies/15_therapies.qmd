## 15.1 What Is Psychotherapy?

## What Is Psychotherapy?

- Psychotherapy is a structured psychological intervention.
- It is provided by trained mental health professionals.
- Its goal is to reduce distress and improve everyday functioning.

## Psychotherapy vs Other Help

- Psychotherapy goes beyond advice or “a good listener.”
- It uses psychological principles and evidence-based methods.
- It follows a clear structure, with specific goals and professional boundaries.

## Brief History of Psychotherapy

- Care moved from asylums and “moral treatment” toward modern psychotherapy.
- Psychoanalysis (Freud) was an early model of talk-based therapy.
- Behavior, cognitive, humanistic, family, and integrative therapies developed later.

## Major Dimensions of Therapies

- Therapies differ in whether they focus on insight or on action.
- Therapists may take a directive or a nondirective style.
- Therapy can be offered in individual, group, or family formats.
- Work can be open-ended or brief and time-limited.

## Common Factors in Effective Therapy

- Effective therapy has a strong therapeutic alliance built on trust and collaboration.
- It provides a safe, structured space to work with difficult experiences.
- Clients learn new ways of thinking, feeling, and responding.
- Clients practice behavior change between sessions and receive support while they do so.

## Does Psychotherapy Work?

- On average, people who receive psychotherapy do better than most people who do not receive treatment.
- Many therapy approaches are roughly equivalent when they are delivered competently.
- For some specific disorders, certain treatments are preferred over others.

## Who Benefits Most?

- Clients benefit more when they attend sessions, engage actively, and practice between sessions.
- Some people improve even when they have severe symptoms or long histories.
- Outcomes are shaped by motivation, social support, and how well therapy fits the person’s life.

## 15.2 Behavior Therapies"

## Behavior Therapies: Big Idea

- Behavior is learned and can be reshaped.
- Behavior therapies use conditioning principles to change behavior.
- They focus on observable actions and the current environment.

## Classical Conditioning–Based Approaches

- Some problem behaviors are tied to conditioned fear or anxiety.
- Behavior therapists use repeated safe exposure without escape.
- The goal is to reduce avoidance so that fear can decline over time.

## Systematic Desensitization

- The client and therapist build a fear hierarchy from least to most feared situations.
- The client practices relaxation or coping skills with each step.
- The client moves through gradual exposures until fear at each level feels manageable.

## Flooding and Intensive Exposure

- Flooding uses prolonged, high-intensity exposure to the feared situation.
- Escape and safety behaviors are not allowed during the exposure.
- Anxiety typically rises, peaks, and then declines naturally over time.

## Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP)

- ERP is especially used for obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD).
- The client is exposed to an obsessional trigger in a planned, supported way.
- The therapist helps prevent the ritual or compulsion so anxiety can habituate.
- Clients learn, “I can tolerate the urge without giving in.”

## Operant Conditioning–Based Approaches

- Operant methods shape behavior through its consequences.
- Desired behaviors are increased with reinforcement.
- Dangerous or disruptive behaviors are decreased by withholding rewards and setting safe limits.

## Token Economies and Behavior Contracts

- In a token economy, clients earn points or tokens for target behaviors.
- Tokens can be traded for privileges or rewards.
- Behavior contracts clearly state the expected behaviors and their consequences in writing.

## Intensive Behavioral Interventions

- Intensive behavioral interventions are often used for autistic and other neurodevelopmental conditions.
- Skills are broken into small steps and reinforced consistently.
- Goals include increasing communication, self-care, and social skills, and reducing dangerous acts.

## Strengths and Limits of Behavior Therapy

- Strengths include clear goals and strong evidence for phobias, OCD, and some child behavior problems.
- Behavior therapy can feel mechanical if values and meaning are ignored.
- Therapists must plan for skills to generalize to real-world situations.

## 15.3 Cognitive, CBT, and Humanistic Therapies"

## Cognitive and CBT Approaches: Big Idea

- Cognitive and CBT approaches focus on thought patterns that drive emotion and behavior.
- They emphasize that it is not just events, but our interpretations of events, that matter.
- The goal is to help clients identify, test, and change unhelpful beliefs.

## Beck’s Cognitive Therapy

- Clients track automatic thoughts in situations that trigger strong emotions.
- They learn to notice cognitive distortions, such as all-or-nothing thinking, catastrophizing, and overgeneralizing.
- They examine evidence for and against their thoughts and build more balanced interpretations.

## Ellis’s Rational–Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT)

- REBT uses the A–B–C model: A is the activating event, B is the belief, and C is the emotional or behavioral consequence.
- The therapist and client target rigid or irrational beliefs, such as “I must be perfect” or “I am worthless.”
- Clients practice replacing these beliefs with more rational, flexible self-statements.

## Core Features of CBT

- CBT uses structured, time-limited, goal-focused sessions.
- It combines cognitive tools with behavioral experiments and homework assignments.
- CBT has strong evidence for treating depression, anxiety, and many other conditions.

## Humanistic Therapies: Big Idea

- Humanistic therapies view people as oriented toward growth, authenticity, and self-actualization.
- Problems often arise when a person’s experience is invalidated or when “conditions of worth” are imposed.
- Therapy aims to create conditions that allow healthy growth to resume.

## Person-Centered Therapy (Rogers)

- The therapist offers unconditional positive regard, or accepting the client without judgment.
- The therapist uses deep empathy and reflective listening to understand the client’s experience.
- Genuineness, or congruence, means the therapist is real and present, not just acting out a role.

## Humanistic vs Cognitive / CBT

- Humanistic therapies are usually nondirective and emphasize the relationship and the client’s lived experience.
- Cognitive and CBT approaches are more directive and emphasize skills, homework, and problem-solving.
- Many modern therapies integrate elements from both humanistic and cognitive–behavioral approaches.

## 15.4 Medical and Biological Therapies"

## Medical / Biological Therapies: Big Idea

- Medical and biological therapies target the brain and body directly.
- They are often combined with psychotherapy and other supports.
- They include medications, brain stimulation, limited surgery, and hospitalization when needed.

## Antipsychotic Medications

- Antipsychotic medications are used mainly for psychotic disorders and severe mood episodes such as mania.
- Traditional (first-generation) antipsychotics strongly block dopamine and can cause movement-related side effects.
- Atypical (second-generation) antipsychotics act on a broader set of receptors and may cause metabolic side effects such as weight gain and changes in blood sugar.

## Antidepressants and Mood Stabilizers

- Antidepressants, including SSRIs, SNRIs, and other classes, are used for depression, many anxiety disorders, and OCD.
- Antidepressants often take several weeks before full benefit appears, and side effects must be monitored.
- Mood stabilizers, such as lithium and some anticonvulsants, are key treatments for bipolar disorders.

## Anti-Anxiety Medications

- Benzodiazepines can provide fast relief of acute anxiety but carry risks of tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal.
- Some non-benzodiazepine options, such as certain antidepressants or buspirone, may be used for longer-term anxiety treatment.
- Anti-anxiety medications are usually most effective when used short-term and combined with skills-based therapies.

## Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)

- Modern ECT is done under anesthesia with controlled seizures and careful medical monitoring.
- ECT can be effective for severe, treatment-resistant depression and some forms of catatonia.
- Possible memory side effects are weighed against potential benefits, and ECT is used when benefits clearly outweigh the risks.

## Other Brain Stimulation and Psychosurgery

- Newer brain stimulation methods include repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and deep brain stimulation, which are used in limited, specific cases.
- Psychosurgery is now rare, highly targeted, and considered only as a last resort.
- Historical examples such as lobotomy highlight the need for strong ethical and scientific safeguards.

## Hospitalization and Community Care

- Hospitalization is used when there is immediate danger or severe instability that requires intensive support.
- Goals of hospitalization include safety, stabilization, medication adjustment, and discharge planning.
- Community mental health services include outpatient care, case management, day programs, and assertive community treatment (ACT) teams.

## Integrating Biological and Psychological Treatments

- For many conditions, the best outcomes come from combining medications with psychotherapy and social support.
- Medications can reduce symptom intensity so that clients can participate more fully in therapy and daily life.
- Ongoing, coordinated care aims to prevent a “revolving door” pattern of repeated crises and brief contacts.
