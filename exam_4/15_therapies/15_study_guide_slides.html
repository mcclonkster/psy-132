<h1>Chapter 15: Psychological Therapies – Student Summary</h1>
<p>This chapter explains <strong>how modern psychology tries to reduce mental and emotional suffering</strong>. It covers what psychotherapy is, how it differs from other kinds of help, the main psychological therapy approaches (behavior, cognitive/CBT, humanistic), and <strong>medical / biological treatments</strong> such as medications and brain stimulation. It also touches on <strong>cultural competence</strong>, <strong>basic counseling skills</strong>, and <strong>how to find a therapist</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-is-psychotherapy" class="slide level2">
<h2>15.1 What Is Psychotherapy?</h2>
<p><strong>Psychotherapy</strong> is a <strong>planned, systematic psychological intervention</strong> delivered by a <strong>trained helper or clinician</strong>, with the goal of changing <strong>thoughts, feelings, and behavior</strong> and improving overall functioning. It is more than advice or “a good listener,” because it uses <strong>psychological principles</strong>, <strong>evidence-based methods</strong>, and <strong>clear structure, goals, and professional boundaries</strong>.</p>
<p>Historically, societies used treatments such as <strong>trepanning, exorcism, and long-term confinement</strong>. In 1793, <strong>Philippe Pinel</strong> introduced moral treatment, emphasizing more humane care. Later, <strong>Freud’s psychoanalysis</strong> became the first structured “talking cure,” using free association, dream analysis, and attention to resistance and transference to uncover unconscious conflicts. From there, behavior, cognitive, humanistic, family, and integrative approaches developed.</p>
<p>Therapy approaches can be described with several <strong>key dimensions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Insight vs.&nbsp;action focus</strong>: understanding oneself vs.&nbsp;directly changing behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Directive vs.&nbsp;nondirective style</strong>: therapist leading vs.&nbsp;client leading.</li>
<li><strong>Individual vs.&nbsp;group / family</strong>: one-on-one vs.&nbsp;multiple clients together.</li>
<li><strong>Face-to-face vs.&nbsp;distance</strong>: in-person vs.&nbsp;online or phone-based.</li>
<li><strong>Open-ended vs.&nbsp;brief / time-limited</strong> work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Across different methods, several <strong>common factors</strong> help therapy work:</p>
<ul>
<li>A strong <strong>therapeutic alliance</strong> (trusting, collaborative relationship).</li>
<li>A <strong>safe, protected setting</strong> where clients can speak openly.</li>
<li>A believable <strong>explanation</strong> for distress.</li>
<li><strong>New perspectives and skills</strong> that clients can practice between sessions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Early research debates questioned whether therapy was any better than “time alone,” but current evidence supports the effectiveness of psychotherapy. On average, <strong>therapy clients do better than most untreated people</strong>, and the most effective approaches for specific problems are often <strong>empirically supported treatments</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Cultural competence</strong> means therapists adapt methods to fit the client’s cultural context, recognize their own biases, understand the client’s cultural identity and level of acculturation, and use community and cultural resources when helpful.</p>
</section>
<section id="behavior-therapies" class="slide level2">
<h2>15.2 Behavior Therapies</h2>
<p><strong>Behavior therapy</strong> focuses on <strong>observable behavior change</strong> and uses <strong>learning principles</strong>—classical and operant conditioning—to change behavior. Insight into the past is not required; the emphasis is on current behavior and environment. Behavior therapists assume that <strong>behavior is learned and can be unlearned or reshaped</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="classical-conditioningbased-therapies">Classical Conditioning–Based Therapies</h3>
<p>Classical conditioning-based approaches focus on <strong>fear and anxiety</strong> that have become linked to certain objects or situations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Systematic desensitization</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Build a <strong>fear hierarchy</strong> from least to most feared situations.</li>
<li>Pair <strong>relaxation or coping skills</strong> with each step.</li>
<li>Gradual exposure until items feel manageable. (Recent research suggests this is not always the most effective method, but it is historically important.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Flooding and intensive exposure</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>High-intensity exposure</strong> to feared situations.</li>
<li>No escape or safety behaviors allowed.</li>
<li>Anxiety eventually peaks and then declines naturally.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP)</strong> (especially for OCD):
<ul>
<li>Expose the person to the <strong>obsessional trigger</strong>.</li>
<li>Prevent the <strong>ritual or compulsion</strong>.</li>
<li>The person learns, “I can tolerate the anxiety or urge without giving in.”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="operant-conditioningbased-therapies">Operant Conditioning–Based Therapies</h3>
<p>Operant methods focus on <strong>consequences</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reinforcement</strong>: increase desired behaviors with rewards.</li>
<li><strong>Extinction</strong>: reduce behaviors by removing reinforcement.</li>
<li><strong>Shaping</strong>: build new behaviors through small steps and reinforcement.</li>
<li><strong>Time-out</strong>: briefly remove access to reinforcement after misbehavior.</li>
<li><strong>Token economies</strong>: give points or tokens for target behaviors, which can be exchanged for privileges or rewards.</li>
<li><strong>Behavior contracts</strong>: written agreements that clarify behaviors and consequences.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Intensive behavioral interventions</strong> are often used for <strong>autism spectrum and developmental conditions</strong>. They break skills into small steps, use consistent reinforcement, and aim to increase communication, self-care, and social skills while reducing dangerous acts.</p>
<p><strong>Strengths</strong> of behavior therapy include <strong>clear goals</strong> and <strong>strong evidence</strong> for phobias, OCD, and some child behavior problems. <strong>Limits</strong> include the risk that therapy may feel mechanical if <strong>values and meaning</strong> are ignored, and the need to plan for <strong>generalization</strong> of skills into real-world situations.</p>
</section>
<section id="cognitive-and-humanistic-therapies" class="slide level2">
<h2>15.3 Cognitive and Humanistic Therapies</h2>
<h3 id="cognitive-and-cbt-approaches">Cognitive and CBT Approaches</h3>
<p><strong>Cognitive therapies</strong> focus on <strong>thought patterns</strong> that drive emotion and behavior. The central idea is: <strong>it is not just events that matter, but how we interpret them.</strong> Goals include identifying, testing, and changing <strong>unhelpful beliefs</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Beck’s cognitive therapy</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Track <strong>automatic thoughts</strong> in triggering situations.</li>
<li>Notice <strong>cognitive distortions</strong> (for example, all-or-nothing thinking, catastrophizing, overgeneralizing, selective perception).</li>
<li>Examine evidence for and against these thoughts and build more <strong>balanced</strong> alternatives.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Rational–Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Uses the <strong>ABC model</strong>: A = activating event, B = belief, C = consequence.</li>
<li>Targets <strong>irrational beliefs</strong> (for example, “I must be perfect” or “I’m worthless”).</li>
<li>Replaces them with more <strong>rational, flexible self-statements</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cognitive–Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Combines cognitive techniques with <strong>behavioral strategies</strong> such as experiments and homework.</li>
<li>Sessions are <strong>structured, time-limited, and goal-focused</strong>.</li>
<li>Has strong evidence for <strong>depression, anxiety, and many other conditions</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="humanistic-therapies">Humanistic Therapies</h3>
<p><strong>Humanistic therapies</strong> see people as oriented toward <strong>growth, authenticity, and self-actualization</strong>. Problems arise when experience is invalidated or when “conditions of worth” are imposed (for example, “I am acceptable only when I succeed”). Therapy aims to create conditions that allow healthy growth to resume.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Person-centered (client-centered) therapy – Rogers</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Unconditional positive regard</strong>: acceptance of the person as worthy, even when behavior is problematic.</li>
<li><strong>Empathy and reflective listening</strong>: the therapist works to understand the client’s inner world and reflect it back.</li>
<li><strong>Genuineness / congruence</strong>: the therapist is real and transparent rather than playing a rigid role.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Gestalt therapy</strong> emphasizes awareness, responsibility, and “here-and-now” experience.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Existential therapy</strong> focuses on choice, meaning, and responsibility in the face of life’s realities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Humanistic vs.&nbsp;Cognitive / CBT</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Humanistic therapies tend to be more <strong>nondirective</strong>, emphasizing the <strong>relationship and lived experience</strong>.</li>
<li>CBT is more <strong>directive</strong>, emphasizing <strong>skills, homework, and problem-solving</strong>.</li>
<li>Many modern therapists <strong>integrate</strong> elements of both approaches.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="medical-biological-therapies" class="slide level2">
<h2>15.4 Medical / Biological Therapies</h2>
<p><strong>Medical / biological therapies</strong> target the <strong>brain and body directly</strong> and are often combined with psychotherapy and social support. They include <strong>medications</strong>, <strong>brain stimulation</strong>, limited <strong>surgery</strong>, <strong>hospitalization</strong>, and community-based programs.</p>
<h3 id="medications">Medications</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Antipsychotic medications</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Used for <strong>psychotic disorders</strong>, severe <strong>mania</strong>, and some <strong>aggression</strong>.</li>
<li>Traditional (first-generation) drugs: strong <strong>dopamine blockade</strong>, with risk of movement side effects.</li>
<li>Atypical (second-generation) drugs: broader receptor profiles, with risk of <strong>metabolic problems</strong> (for example, weight gain).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Antidepressants and mood stabilizers</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Antidepressants (SSRIs, SNRIs, others) are used for <strong>depression</strong>, many <strong>anxiety disorders</strong>, and <strong>OCD</strong>.</li>
<li>They often take <strong>weeks</strong> before full benefit and require monitoring for side effects or activation.</li>
<li>Mood stabilizers (for example, lithium, anticonvulsants) are key in treating <strong>bipolar disorders</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Anti-anxiety medications</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Benzodiazepines</strong> provide <strong>fast relief</strong> but carry risks of <strong>tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal</strong>.</li>
<li>Some <strong>non-benzodiazepine options</strong> (certain antidepressants, buspirone) may be used for longer-term management.</li>
<li>Best used <strong>short-term</strong> and alongside <strong>skills-based therapy</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="brain-stimulation-and-psychosurgery">Brain Stimulation and Psychosurgery</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Modern ECT uses <strong>anesthesia</strong>, controlled seizures, and careful monitoring.</li>
<li>It is effective for <strong>severe, treatment-resistant depression</strong> and some <strong>catatonia</strong>.</li>
<li>There can be <strong>memory side effects</strong>, so it is used when benefits clearly outweigh risks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Other brain stimulation</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)</strong> and <strong>deep brain stimulation (DBS)</strong> are newer methods with more limited use.</li>
<li><strong>Psychosurgery</strong> is now rare, highly targeted, and a <strong>last resort</strong>, in contrast to historical practices such as lobotomy.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hospitalization-and-community-care">Hospitalization and Community Care</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hospitalization</strong> is used when there is <strong>immediate danger</strong> or severe instability. Goals include <strong>safety, stabilization, medication adjustment, and discharge planning</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Partial hospitalization programs</strong> provide structured daytime treatment without overnight stays.</li>
<li><strong>Deinstitutionalization</strong> shifted care from large institutions to <strong>community-based services</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Halfway houses</strong> offer supervised living for people transitioning toward independence.</li>
<li><strong>Community mental health programs</strong> and prevention efforts support ongoing care through outpatient services, case management, and outreach.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best outcomes</strong> for many conditions come from <strong>combined approaches</strong>: medications can reduce symptom intensity, while psychotherapy builds skills, meaning, and relationships. The goal is <strong>continuity of care</strong>, not just “revolving door” crisis treatment.</p>
</section>
<section id="basic-counseling-skills-and-finding-help" class="slide level2">
<h2>15.5 Basic Counseling Skills and Finding Help</h2>
<p>Even outside professional roles, people can use <strong>basic counseling skills</strong> to be more helpful and supportive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <strong>active listening</strong> to show attention and understanding.</li>
<li>Use <strong>reflection</strong> to feed key ideas and feelings back to the speaker.</li>
<li>Ask <strong>open-ended questions</strong> to invite deeper responses.</li>
<li>Help people <strong>clarify problems in their own words</strong>.</li>
<li>Avoid giving direct advice or telling people what to do.</li>
<li>Maintain <strong>confidentiality</strong> within legal and ethical limits.</li>
</ul>
<p>When <strong>finding a therapist</strong>, common starting points include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Primary care providers.</li>
<li>Universities and campus counseling centers.</li>
<li>Community centers and mental health associations.</li>
<li>Hotlines and referral services.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to consider a therapist’s <strong>qualifications, training, and experience</strong>, and to pay attention to the <strong>therapeutic alliance</strong>—the overall fit, comfort, and trust you feel with the person.</p>

<h2>Short-Answer – Example Elements for Full Credit</h2>
<p><strong>11.</strong><br>
- Psychotherapy: planned, systematic, delivered by a trained clinician, uses psychological principles, evidence-based methods, clear goals and boundaries.<br>
- Different from a friend: not just advice or venting; has structure, confidentiality limits, and a specific change plan.</p>
<p><strong>12.</strong><br>
- Systematic desensitization: build a fear hierarchy (photos → across the street → nearby → petting), pair each step with relaxation or coping skills, move gradually as fear decreases.<br>
- Flooding: prolonged exposure to dogs at a high level of fear without escape or safety behaviors until anxiety peaks and declines.</p>
<p><strong>13.</strong><br>
- Example distortion: “If I make one mistake, I am a total failure.”<br>
- CBT response: identify the thought, examine evidence for and against it, generate a more balanced thought (for example, “Everyone makes mistakes; one mistake does not erase all my successes”), possibly test it in real situations.</p>
<p><strong>14.</strong><br>
- Humanistic: more nondirective, emphasizes relationship quality, empathy, unconditional positive regard, and here-and-now experience.<br>
- CBT: more directive, emphasizes skills, homework, and problem-solving; the therapist guides structured exercises.</p>
<p><strong>15.</strong><br>
- ERP: expose the client to triggers for checking (for example, leaving the door locked once), prevent checking rituals, stay with the anxiety until it decreases, and repeat until urge to check lessens.</p>
<p><strong>16.</strong><br>
- Medication can reduce symptom intensity (for example, antidepressants for depression, antipsychotics for psychosis).<br>
- Psychotherapy builds coping skills, insight, and relationship changes.<br>
- Together they can produce stronger and more stable improvements than either alone.</p>
<p><strong>17.</strong><br>
- Examples of skills: active listening (helps the friend feel heard), reflection (shows understanding and helps clarify feelings), open-ended questions (invites deeper sharing), clarifying problems in their own words.<br>
- Rationale: reduces isolation, organizes thoughts, and supports problem-solving without taking over.</p>
<p><strong>18.</strong><br>
- Starting points: primary care provider, university counseling center, community mental health center, hotline, or mental health association.<br>
- Pay attention to: therapist’s qualifications and training, and especially the therapeutic alliance (fit, comfort, trust).</p>
