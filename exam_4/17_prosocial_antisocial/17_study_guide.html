<h1>Chapter 17: Prosocial and Antisocial Behavior – Student Summary</h1>
<p>Social psychology studies how we think about, influence, and relate to one another. This chapter focuses on the ways people <strong>connect, help, harm, and heal</strong>. It covers affiliation and attraction, prosocial and antisocial behavior, aggression and prejudice, and how better norms can be built.</p>
</section>
<section id="connection-affiliation-and-attraction" class="slide level2">
<h2>Connection, Affiliation, and Attraction</h2>
<p>Humans have a basic <strong>need to belong</strong>. We seek affiliation to form and maintain social bonds. These connections reduce anxiety, provide approval, and create social support. We also use <strong>social comparison</strong> to evaluate our thoughts and abilities by comparing ourselves to others.</p>
<p>Several factors influence <strong>attraction</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Proximity</strong>: We tend to like people who are physically close to us.</li>
<li><strong>Similarity</strong>: We are drawn to people who are like us in attitudes, interests, or values.</li>
<li><strong>Reciprocity</strong>: Mutual liking strengthens connection; we like people who like us back.</li>
<li><strong>Physical attractiveness</strong>: There is a “beautiful is good” effect in which attractive people are often assumed to have other positive qualities.</li>
</ul>
<p>In <strong>relationships and love</strong>, self-disclosure (sharing personal information) builds trust. Social exchange theory suggests that we stay in relationships when the rewards seem to outweigh the costs. Sternberg’s triangular theory of love describes love in terms of <strong>intimacy</strong>, <strong>passion</strong>, and <strong>commitment</strong>, which can combine in different ways to create different types of love.</p>
</section>
<section id="prosocial-behavior-and-helping" class="slide level2">
<h2>Prosocial Behavior and Helping</h2>
<p><strong>Prosocial behavior</strong> refers to voluntary actions intended to benefit others, such as helping, sharing, or comforting. These actions strengthen relationships and community. <strong>Antisocial behavior</strong>, in contrast, involves intentional actions that harm others or violate norms, such as aggression, bullying, or harassment. Prosocial acts build connection; antisocial acts tear it down.</p>
<p>People help for different reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Egoism</strong>: Helping for personal gain, such as feeling good or looking good to others.</li>
<li><strong>Altruism</strong>: Helping with no expectation of reward, based on concern for others.</li>
<li><strong>Evolutionary motives</strong>: Helping kin can increase the survival of shared genes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Helping depends on the person in need, the potential helper, and the situation. People are more likely to help <strong>in-group</strong> members, people they feel empathy for, and in situations where they have time, skills, and a sense of responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>Empathy</strong> means feeling or understanding another person’s emotion and wanting to reduce their distress. Empathy can lead to genuine altruism, where people help out of concern rather than self-interest.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-bystander-effect-decision-chain-and-social-dilemmas" class="slide level2">
<h2>The Bystander Effect, Decision Chain, and Social Dilemmas</h2>
<p>The <strong>bystander effect</strong> occurs when the presence of others reduces the chance that any one person will help. A key reason is <strong>diffusion of responsibility</strong>: each bystander assumes that someone else will act, so responsibility feels spread out. Fear of embarrassment and uncertainty about the situation can also interfere with helping.</p>
<p>Helping usually requires passing through a <strong>decision chain</strong>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Notice the situation.</li>
<li>Interpret it as an emergency or situation that needs help.</li>
<li>Take responsibility to act.</li>
<li>Know how to help.</li>
<li>Actually act.</li>
</ol>
<p>Breakdowns at any stage can stop helping. People help more when they notice the situation, see it as urgent, feel personally responsible, and have time and skills to act. Being in a good mood and seeing others help can increase helping.</p>
<p>In <strong>social dilemmas</strong>, self-interest is in tension with what is best for the group. Examples include conserving resources or following public health guidelines. <strong>Trust, communication, and clear commitments</strong> can shift choices toward cooperation. When people trust each other and share information, dilemmas can turn into “win–win” situations.</p>
</section>
<section id="aggression-prejudice-and-discrimination" class="slide level2">
<h2>Aggression, Prejudice, and Discrimination</h2>
<p><strong>Aggression</strong> is intentional harm toward another person, either physical or psychological. Accidents are not aggression. Common forms include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hostile aggression</strong>: driven by anger or a desire for revenge.</li>
<li><strong>Instrumental aggression</strong>: goal-directed harm used as a means to an end.</li>
<li><strong>Relational aggression</strong>: harming someone’s social ties or reputation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Aggression arises from a mix of <strong>biology, learning, and situation</strong>. Biological factors (hormones such as testosterone, genetics, brain systems like the amygdala and frontal control) can increase readiness to aggress. Learning and situational factors (modeling, frustration or stress, violent media, provocation) can amplify or suppress aggressive responses. Some theories emphasize that <strong>blocked goals and frustration</strong> can lead to anger and aggression.</p>
<p>In discussions of <strong>prejudice</strong>, it helps to separate three levels (sometimes remembered as BEL):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stereotype (Belief)</strong>: A belief about the characteristics of a group.</li>
<li><strong>Prejudice (Emotion/attitude)</strong>: A negative feeling or attitude toward a group.</li>
<li><strong>Discrimination (Lever/behavior)</strong>: Unfair behavior toward members of a group.</li>
</ul>
<p>These levels interact to maintain unequal outcomes unless they are identified and corrected. Knowing whether a problem is at the level of belief, feeling, or behavior helps target the right kind of change.</p>
<p><strong>Reducing prejudice</strong> is more effective when conditions are structured:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Optimal contact</strong>: equal status, cooperation, common goals, and institutional support.</li>
<li><strong>Superordinate goals</strong>: goals that groups must work on together.</li>
<li><strong>Empathy and diverse friendships</strong>: seeing from other perspectives and forming cross-group relationships.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bias reduction is an ongoing process that involves both individual efforts (awareness, perspective-taking) and institutional changes (inclusive policies and accountability). Diversity can benefit creativity, decision making, and well-being when inclusion is actively supported.</p>
</section>
<section id="building-better-norms-and-using-our-agency" class="slide level2">
<h2>Building Better Norms and Using Our Agency</h2>
<p>Prosocial behavior can be promoted by making <strong>kindness visible and reinforced</strong>, for example by modeling, recognition, and consistent norms. Teaching <strong>perspective-taking</strong> and emotional skills supports prosocial choices. What a community spotlights, it tends to multiply.</p>
<p>Preventing antisocial behavior involves reducing <strong>stressors</strong> (such as poverty and exposure to violence), building <strong>self-control and problem-solving skills</strong>, monitoring <strong>high-risk contexts</strong> (including online spaces), and strengthening <strong>community supports</strong>. Skills plus supports plus safer contexts mean less harm.</p>
<p>The chapter emphasizes <strong>two meta-takeaways</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The power of the situation</strong>: Small context cues, such as crowds, time pressure, and role models, strongly shape behavior. Designing environments that cue responsibility, clarity, and efficacy can nudge people toward helping and cooperation.</li>
<li><strong>Agency remains</strong>: Simple scripts like “You—call 911” and clear norms increase the likelihood of action, even under pressure. People who prepare and practice these responses are more likely to move from silence to support when it matters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Psychology in action means using these ideas to reduce prejudice, improve cooperation, and build stronger, more inclusive communities.</p>

<h2>Short-Answer – Example Elements for Full Credit</h2>
<p><strong>9.</strong><br>
- Prosocial: voluntary actions intended to benefit others (for example, helping, sharing, comforting).<br>
- Antisocial: intentional actions that harm others or violate norms (for example, bullying, harassment, vandalism).<br>
- Any reasonable everyday examples mapped correctly to each category.</p>
<p><strong>10.</strong><br>
- Bystander effect: presence of others reduces likelihood of help.<br>
- Diffusion of responsibility: each bystander assumes someone else will act, so no one takes responsibility.<br>
- Students may also mention fear of embarrassment or uncertainty.</p>
<p><strong>11.</strong><br>
- Steps: notice → interpret as needing help → take responsibility → know how to help → act.<br>
- Example of breakdown (any one):<br>
- Not noticing due to distraction or time pressure.<br>
- Interpreting as “not serious” or “someone else’s business.”<br>
- Assuming “someone else will do something.”<br>
- Not knowing how to help (no skills).<br>
- Hesitating and failing to act.</p>
<p><strong>12.</strong><br>
- Egoistic helping: helping for personal gain, such as praise, rewards, or avoiding guilt.<br>
- Altruistic helping: helping without expectation of reward, motivated by concern for the other person.<br>
- Student examples should clearly match each motive.</p>
<p><strong>13.</strong><br>
- Hostile aggression: harm driven by anger or revenge (for example, punching someone after being insulted).<br>
- Instrumental aggression: harm used as a means to an end (for example, tripping a competitor to win a game).<br>
- Relational aggression: damage to social ties or reputation (for example, spreading rumors to exclude someone).<br>
- Any two forms with correct definitions and examples earn full credit.</p>
<p><strong>14.</strong><br>
- Stereotype (belief): “People from Group X are all lazy.”<br>
- Prejudice (emotion/attitude): “I dislike people from Group X.”<br>
- Discrimination (behavior): refusing to hire or serve people from Group X.<br>
- Must show the same target group across all three for best clarity.</p>
<p><strong>15.</strong><br>
- Individual-level strategies: increasing awareness of one’s own biases, practicing perspective-taking, building cross-group friendships, speaking up when hearing biased remarks.<br>
- Institutional/policy strategies: inclusive hiring or admissions practices, diversity training with real accountability, structured cooperative projects, clear anti-discrimination policies.<br>
- One of each is required.</p>
<p><strong>16.</strong><br>
- Situational/norm changes might include:<br>
- Teaching simple intervention scripts (for example, “You—get help”).<br>
- Establishing clear norms that harassment is reported and challenged.<br>
- Training peer leaders or bystander intervention teams.<br>
- Making reporting mechanisms visible and safe.<br>
- Students should connect these to reducing diffusion of responsibility, clarifying norms, or increasing perceived efficacy.</p>
