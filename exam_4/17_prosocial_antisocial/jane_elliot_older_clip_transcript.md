[00:00:00] this is a special week does anybody know
[00:00:02] what it is national Brotherhood week
[00:00:05] what's Brotherhood treat everyone as
[00:00:07] though he was your brother
[00:00:10] and is there anyone in this United
[00:00:12] States that we do not treat as our
[00:00:14] brothers yes people who else in
[00:00:19] absolutely the Indians many places in
[00:00:22] the United States how are black people
[00:00:23] treated how are indians treated how are
[00:00:26] people who are of a different color than
[00:00:27] we are they don't get anything in this
[00:00:30] world why is that because they're
[00:00:32] different color you think you know how I
[00:00:34] would feel to me judged by the color of
[00:00:36] your skin
[00:00:37] I don't do you think you do no I don't
[00:00:39] think you'd know how that felt unless
[00:00:41] you had been through it would you it
[00:00:43] might be interesting to judge people
[00:00:45] today by the color of their eyes would
[00:00:48] you like to try this sounds like fun
[00:00:50] doesn't it since I'm the teacher and I
[00:00:52] have blue eyes I think maybe the blue
[00:00:55] eyed people should be on top the first
[00:00:57] day I mean the blue eyed people are the
[00:01:00] better people in this room oh yes they
[00:01:04] are
[00:01:04] all right people are smarter than brown
[00:01:06] eyed people this is a fact the
[00:01:10] brown-eyed people do not get to use the
[00:01:13] drinking fountain you'll have to use the
[00:01:15] paper cups you brown-eyed people are not
[00:01:19] to play with the blue-eyed people on the
[00:01:21] playground the brown-eyed people in this
[00:01:23] room today are going to wear collars so
[00:01:25] that we can tell from a distance what
[00:01:27] color your eyes are ready Laurie
[00:01:30] she's a brown-eyed you'll begin to
[00:01:33] notice today that we spend a great deal
[00:01:35] of time waiting for brown-eyed people I
[00:01:37] don't see the yardstick to you oh you
[00:01:46] think if the brown-eyed people get out
[00:01:47] of hand that would be the thing to use
[00:01:49] who goes first to lunch the blue-eyed
[00:01:52] people who like people may go back for
[00:01:54] seconds brown-eyed people do not run
[00:01:56] don't you know and it seems like when we
[00:02:06] were down on the bottom everything bad
[00:02:07] has happened and uh the way they treated
[00:02:10] you you felt like you didn't even want
[00:02:12] to try to do anything to like mrs. Ellie
[00:02:14] it was taking our best friends away from
[00:02:16] what happened at recess we're two of you
[00:02:18] boys fighting class so pony names and I
[00:02:21] can't even the gut but the brown eyes
[00:02:30] what's wrong with being how Brown were
[00:02:33] stupid I watched what had been marvelous
[00:02:37] cooperative wonderful thoughtful
[00:02:40] children turn into nasty vicious
[00:02:45] discriminating little third graders in
[00:02:49] space of 15 minutes yesterday I told you
[00:02:52] that brown-eyed people aren't as good as
[00:02:54] blue-eyed people that wasn't true I lied
[00:02:56] to you yesterday the truth is that
[00:03:01] brown-eyed people are better than
[00:03:03] blue-eyed people Russell where are your
[00:03:05] glasses
[00:03:05] I forgot them you forgot them and what
[00:03:08] color are your eyes

[00:03:16] forget her glasses

[00:03:21] his glasses he forgot yesterday we were
[00:03:26] visiting and Greg said boy I like to hit
[00:03:29] my little sister as hard as I can that's
[00:03:31] fun what does that tell you about
[00:03:33] blue-eyed people the brown-eyed people
[00:03:37] may take off their collars and each of
[00:03:42] you may put your collar on a blue-eyed
[00:03:44] person
[00:03:47] the brown-eyed people get five extra
[00:03:50] minutes of recess you blue-eyed people
[00:03:52] are not allowed to be on the playground
[00:03:55] equipment you blue-eyed people are not
[00:03:57] to play with the brown-eyed people
[00:03:59] brown-eyed people are better than
[00:04:01] blue-eyed people they are smarter than
[00:04:03] blue-eyed people and if you don't
[00:04:05] believe it look at Brian I use
[00:04:09] orton-gillingham phonics we use the card
[00:04:11] pack the brown-eyed children were in the
[00:04:12] low class the first day and it took them
[00:04:15] five and a half minutes to get to the
[00:04:16] card pack the second day it took them
[00:04:18] two and a half minutes the only thing
[00:04:21] that had changed was the fact that now
[00:04:23] they were superior people couldn't you
[00:04:29] get them yesterday
[00:04:30] oh and you couldn't think as well with
[00:04:38] the collars on four minutes and 18

[00:05:17] certain way because they are different
