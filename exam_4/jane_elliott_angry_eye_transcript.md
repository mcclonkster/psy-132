[00:00:00] I consider this exercise and injection
[00:00:10] of the live virus of racism if you've been through this exercise the next time you see racist behaviors sexist
[00:00:17] behaviors homophobic behaviors that's know centric behaviors Aegis behaviors maybe you will say to yourself wait a
[00:00:24] minute I had that for one morning I'm never going to allow that to happen in my
[00:00:30] presence again without responding to it negatively
[00:00:37] [Music]
[00:00:57] over the course of two and a half hours on a Saturday morning 24 American college students participated in an
[00:01:03] experience which would change their lives it seemed like a good idea at the time I
[00:01:11] don't know I haven't given it much thought I usually get up this early I think it's just going to be people
[00:01:17] talking about their political views and
[00:01:23] some people we see some stupid comments that it's gonna heat up their room I
[00:01:29] really don't know what to expect I just expect a lot of argument about things that we don't necessarily agree on
[00:01:35] [Music] take a nametag put your name on and then
[00:01:40] sign in according to the color of your eyes you didn't hear what I said take a nametag
[00:01:46] [Music] pick a name day they're gonna put your name on it then sign in a flirty color
[00:01:53] of your eyes you sit here
[00:02:04] we're into that room right there stay there until I come for you down ground sit down
[00:02:12] brown-eyed right around the corner that room right there you're always where that captain
[00:02:18] building sit down give you a little nicer please what it's girly in the
[00:02:24] morning you have my sympathy now let me tell you
[00:02:31] something all you have to do is do exactly what I say exactly when I tell you to exactly as I say it if I tell you
[00:02:37] to take your cap off you take your cap off if I need no I do not have to ask you nicely now get over that idea right
[00:02:44] now you got it now move your leg
[00:02:51] in that room Branagh when the
[00:02:57] nice ready Brown I go into this room right around the port
[00:03:03] [Music]
[00:03:12] move your leg don't remove this reason
[00:03:22] [Music]
[00:03:35] I have a dream my four little children
[00:03:44] one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character I
[00:03:52] have a dream today the day after Martin Luther King jr. was
[00:03:57] killed I decided to do an exercise that would help my students to understand racism I tried to make a difference I'm
[00:04:04] still trying to make that difference we do not treated our brothers I feel
[00:04:28] people need this because we are still doing now what we were doing in the fifties is there anything about you
[00:04:33] people that is different from one another that we could use to make part of you
[00:04:42] [Music] okay we could use the car of your eye huh me and you hear that blue-eyed okay
[00:04:51] how many in here I'm Brown it might be interesting to judge of people today by
[00:04:57] the color of their eyes I'm trying to
[00:05:03] get the people who participate in this exercise the opportunity to find out how
[00:05:08] it feels to be something other than white in this society all right people I'm Jane Elliott I'm
[00:05:16] your resident for the day and make no mistake about that that's exactly what this is about I do this in a mean
[00:05:21] nasty way because racism sexism ageism homophobia ethnocentrism are mean and
[00:05:26] nasty today I am here because I have been asked to do an exercise and
[00:05:32] discrimination based on eye color now the purpose of this exercise is to give these nice blue-eyed white kids the
[00:05:40] opportunity to spend about an hour and a half to two hours on the receiving end
[00:05:46] of the treatment which we meet out to people of color on a daily basis in this country they're in a blue eyed holding
[00:05:52] room right now they are not eating they are not drinking there are three chairs in there for 12 people we're going to
[00:05:58] bring these people in here you're going to treat them as though they're inferior because they are inferior everybody
[00:06:05] understand that they're not going to learn because they can't learn and because we're going to set it up so they
[00:06:11] can't learn and if they succeed who has failed we have do people want to fail no
[00:06:18] if they get power who loses power we do you I lose power no for 400 years in
[00:06:24] this country we've been basing our judgment of people on the color of their skin eye color and skin color are caused
[00:06:30] by the same chemical melanin if you had a lot of melanin and your hair your skin in your eyes you have very dark hair
[00:06:36] very dark guys and very dark skin if you have only a little melanin in your skin your hair and your
[00:06:41] you have light skin light hair and light eyes these people all have too little melanin in their eyes so obviously they
[00:06:48] aren't as smart as we are we're going to accuse them of not being as smart as we are when you accuse them is not of not
[00:06:54] being as clean as we are we're going to lower our expectations for them we're going to force them to live down to our
[00:07:00] expectation of them and when they do we're going to blame their inability to perform on the color of their eyes now
[00:07:07] in order to get them in their chat into their adult ego state we're going to try to teach them the listening skills now
[00:07:13] what do we call men that we want to keep in their childlike state boys we're
[00:07:18] gonna call these males boy you're not going to use their given name you're going to call it and boy are you going
[00:07:24] to call them bluey or you're going to call them fool people what do we call
[00:07:31] women besides chicks honey baby gal doll
[00:07:40] face doll dumpling they're all here are
[00:07:53] they packed it up we are going to give them no respect how many of you have
[00:08:01] friends in that group let me put it this way how many of you used to have friends in that group because some of these
[00:08:09] people are going to leave here very angry because they choose to be angry and if they say to you that made me mad
[00:08:17] and I'll never forgive you for that you need to say to them you had it for two and a half hours one day one day in your
[00:08:24] life you had it for two and a half hours and you're still angry about it how often how often have you been
[00:08:31] discriminated against on the basis of the color of your skin number of days more than once in your lifetime more
[00:08:39] than two and a half hours in your lifetime so yeah since the day you were born has it happened to you recently
[00:09:03] can you put the chairs back the way they were put the chair back the way they
[00:09:09] were
[00:09:16] right people's number one freedom in the United States of America
[00:09:21] is the freedom to be totally ignorant about those who are other than white we don't have to learn about those who are
[00:09:28] other than white and our number two freedom is the freedom to deny that were ignorant today we're going to take away
[00:09:35] these people's freedom to be ignorant I want you to understand how the system works and believe me this is how the
[00:09:42] system works we make laws to support white superiority and to reinforce white
[00:09:49] superiority and when you catch on to how it works then we change the laws I didn't invent this exercise I learned
[00:09:55] this from Adolf Hitler one of the ways they decided when into the gas chamber was I color this exercise is not without
[00:10:02] precedent
[00:10:12] [Music] now look at this watch look at him
[00:10:21] should we just sit in should we just sit anywhere if you came into a room in
[00:10:27] which the chairs were arranged in this way and the brown-eyed people were sitting in these chairs in this way and nobody
[00:10:33] was sitting in the chairs in the middle where would you sit in the middle that would make sense to me what it makes
[00:10:38] sense to you where are you going get in the blue-eyed section the blue-eyed section is in the middle of
[00:10:44] the room get there you're a non Brown as
[00:10:53] far as I'm concerned you're a bully now this one giggling what do you know about
[00:10:59] him because he's ignored what else do you know about it he's and he has a little kid little child's ego state
[00:11:06] isn't he get up here and sit down on the floor you together and sit down on the floor I was really tired when I entered
[00:11:18] the room but I didn't have any expectations I was just sitting there and wondering how it could be an
[00:11:25] emotional experience because I had signed the paper that had warned me about ulcers and stress conditions and
[00:11:33] things like this so I was curious and there are a few mumbles about how it was going to go what are you going to do
[00:11:42] that's right waiting for someone to take care of them there in their child legal
[00:11:48] state what are you gonna do
[00:12:04] what do you do what do you say when you walk across someone try excuse me
[00:12:12] certainly thank you I don't think
[00:12:17] anybody really knew what was gonna happen nobody told us ahead of time they just told us to show up at a certain time
[00:12:22] it didn't take very long before intimidation set in and before my my
[00:12:27] buttons were pushed now well I've been talking some of you have been sitting there reading the signs I'm not gonna
[00:12:33] put up with that and you longer so you in the back room stand up and read the
[00:12:38] first line on that wall back there only brown eyes need apply radio so we can
[00:12:44] hear you only brown eyes need apply next blue eyes stand up and read the next
[00:12:51] line Braille watch this one watch this one fits two flexes sit down again then
[00:12:56] stand up for us stand up that's better now I'll read the next
[00:13:04] sign blue-eyes shouldn't hold political office next
[00:13:09] why can't a blue-eyed be more than like your brown read it again get it right this time
[00:13:15] well I can't a blue I be more likely Brown read it again get it right this time pronounce each one of those words
[00:13:21] correctly as they're written why can't a blue eye be more like a
[00:13:26] brown what's the word and it found a blue hey that's the letter A what word
[00:13:32] is that read over get it right why can't a blue-eyed be more like a brown now
[00:13:37] practice one more time why can't a blue-eyed be more like a brown next next
[00:13:52] I'm not prejudiced some of my best friends of blue-eyed how many of you've ever heard that one before in another
[00:13:58] form oh yes favorite claim of liberals right I'm not prejudiced on my best
[00:14:05] friends are black as any person ever said to you a good liberal person ever
[00:14:12] said to you when I see you I don't see you black how many of you have had that
[00:14:18] experience when I see you I don't see you black and what do you say to them when they say that but I am but I am and
[00:14:25] then what do they say is there but I don't see color I don't see color how
[00:14:31] many of you think they do see color well people if they didn't see color they
[00:14:36] wouldn't say when I see you I don't see you but because they wouldn't see black what they so you immediately know that
[00:14:41] they're lying don't you yeah there they are lying there saying I don't see your
[00:14:47] color you can't say I don't see color cuz they need to be seeing in black and white and that would be a really weird
[00:14:53] world to see if everything was black and white we would be some really messed up
[00:14:58] people it happens to me on a date the bases in institution oh man and there's really no way around it cuz
[00:15:06] whether people do it intentionally or not what am I supposed to do you don't
[00:15:11] have to take that and I take it you don't take it good for you good for you
[00:15:18] because as long as you say oh thank you and do you know black people who would say oh thank you yes how many of you
[00:15:25] know black people would say oh thanks I'm glad you don't see me by and by john cena color your skin is only the largest
[00:15:32] organ on your body right probably the part of the exercise I didn't I had the
[00:15:37] most trouble with was when I was forced to realize that I have something that I
[00:15:42] didn't want to give up that I'm in a position that other people aren't in you know there are other people in my
[00:15:47] position but not everybody has that and that it's not fair for me to protect
[00:15:52] that the day these kids these white kids are in this exercise they see themselves as other people see them for the first
[00:15:59] time in their lives you know the physical aspects of those new skills you're afraid not what about you
[00:16:05] definitely not what about you a bit a bit yes so tell me what the bit is that
[00:16:11] you know I'm a bit that I know is that you stand up straight you look at the person who's speaking and you hear tension to what they're saying what if
[00:16:19] you're sitting down I am sitting down then you can't listen
[00:16:26] right unless I sit him down oh you just said you stand up straight I said you sit up straight you did she
[00:16:33] say you sit up straighter did you say you stand on the break is this a universal problem with Boyd
[00:16:38] people you have a paper and pencil with you no do you over in your bag why is it
[00:16:45] in your bag because that's where I keep it that's where you keep it why did you put your paper and pencil over there
[00:16:51] because I was not I did not know when I was going to be meeting you came to a
[00:16:58] learning experience right yes you ever go to a learning experience before yes do you ever take notes yes what did you
[00:17:05] use I used a paper paper and pencil and did you keep it with you so that you
[00:17:10] could take notes yes yes why didn't you do that this time because I was not planning on taking
[00:17:15] notes you weren't planning on taking notes you think you can remember everything that's going to be done in here and said in here not word-for-word
[00:17:22] not word-for-word so what should you have done I probably she's gonna say I
[00:17:27] probably shouldn't read what should you have done I should have brought my paper and pencil over here and kept it with me
[00:17:33] that's right time that's right you're acting angry I am angry what are you angry about I'm angry that you're
[00:17:38] yelling at me do you hear me yelling let's see I mean have I done that yep okay you're using your stern voice are
[00:17:45] you are you defining me no I'm not officially defining me does she say I'm
[00:17:51] yelling what I'm not perception is everything do you feel like I'm yelling
[00:17:56] at you yes yes why because you're using a stern voice mustard honey it isn't my
[00:18:04] fault you're stupid would you like me to go get my paper and pencil I wouldn't like you in any way shape or form
[00:18:09] okay let's get that understood here this isn't a matter of whether I like you or not repeat after me one-hand one-hand
[00:18:16] one-hand took not hand hen hen hen lays
[00:18:21] eggs one-hand one-hand one-hand two ducks one hand to death one hand two ducks three squawking geese one hand two
[00:18:28] ducks three squawking games one hand two ducks three squawking geese four Limerick oysters one hand

[00:18:56] Limerick oysters five I forget the other one I'm sorry so maybe you would have
[00:19:01] been better off if you could have taken notes for this right I do not find the need to take notes for that I'm going to
[00:19:07] ask you to remember this for the rest of this time next one six pairs of darnell varsity's tweezers start with one one
[00:19:15] hand two ducks three squawking geese for it Limerick oysters five I do not know
[00:19:22] six I forget you're gonna have to know this I'm going to keep testing you on
[00:19:28] this what would be a good idea for you to have paper paper and pencil very
[00:19:34] unless the beginning of wisdom now 7,000 Macedonians in full battle
[00:19:39] array start from one there always no other numbers other than one two three
[00:19:46] start with one one and two ducks three
[00:19:51] Limerick three squawking geeks four Limerick oysters fine I still don't
[00:19:57] remember that number six I still don't remember that and 7,000 and whatever he said I'm sorry
[00:20:02] eight brass monkeys from the ancient sacred crypts of Egypt start with one do
[00:20:08] you wish you had a paper and pencil no do you think you're going to need one if I keep testing you on that yes then are
[00:20:14] you gonna wish you had a paper and pencil yes yes in the future what are you gonna do when you go to learning situation and keep it with me you did
[00:20:23] you learn anything yes do you appreciate what you just learned yes did you like the way it was taught no no any of the rest of you ever
[00:20:32] taught in that fashion yes and did you have to express appreciation for it yeah could you learn
[00:20:39] something from her example what are you crying about what are you crying about feeling sorry how are your feelings hurt
[00:20:46] just ordered should I feel sorry for her I expect you to did I feel sorry for her
[00:20:55] some of you are thinking all this is too harsh for this young woman James Byrd
[00:21:02] black man in Texas dragged to death
[00:21:08] behind a pickup truck by three white males Matthew Shepard master Shepard
[00:21:16] young man about your little Oh a little younger you are had the misfortune to be
[00:21:21] born gay beaten beaten with a pistol
[00:21:26] about the head until they cracked his skull and then they hung him on a deer
[00:21:33] fence and left him there overnight and somebody coming along on a bicycle the
[00:21:39] next day saw a bunch of clothing hanging on this deer fence and they went over and started take the clothing off the
[00:21:45] deer fence and found a body in the clothing I'm sorry but those things
[00:21:52] happen because we live in a society in which people are allowed to treat those who are different in an ugly way because
[00:21:59] of their differences I cannot shed tears for a young white
[00:22:05] female in this exercise who knows that this is an exercise who knows that it's
[00:22:11] temporary who knows that she's getting like college credit one hour of credit
[00:22:17] for being here I'm sorry I have to save my sympathy and
[00:22:25] my empathy for those who go through something much worse than this every day of their lives and when they complain
[00:22:32] about it we say you took it wrong or we say it wasn't racism you feel real sorry
[00:22:39] for not really really why not because she really didn't I don't see where she
[00:22:46] was hurt in any way I mean but don't be fine her but as far as you're concerned is this tough it's tough as you make it
[00:22:56] yeah but could you do this yeah you do yeah have you ever been in the situation they're in sometimes yes yes and would
[00:23:04] crying have gotten you out of it no no and when crying I've gotten your sympathies and would that have solve the
[00:23:09] problem no no and when somebody has said get over it yeah yeah yeah tears were
[00:23:16] coming in my eyes and when I saw these people kind of like but it wasn't for them it was for the fact that I know
[00:23:22] people who are going through that right now while you're sitting in that classroom and had the privilege and the time the opportunity to be going through
[00:23:28] an experiment that there are people outside who go through that 10 times
[00:23:33] worse than any student color in that room you don't know which side do you
[00:23:40] blue eyes make good secretaries in that nice how many of you have heard that one
[00:23:46] before how many of you think she got the right sign which time did you read the
[00:23:54] one that says blue eyes make good secretary you read that once she thought we didn't hear you
[00:24:04] if I have but one life let me live it as a brown now we're making progress here
[00:24:11] right when she read that sign
[00:24:17] and you lied to me one two three
[00:24:27] you read that sign this one you liked me
[00:24:34] I wasn't sure how many of you think she sounded unsure she knew what she was
[00:24:42] talking about how many think she's lying now how many of you think she was finding excuses for making a mistake before and
[00:24:49] was willing to say he read before me the last time that's the reason I asked did
[00:24:55] he read before her the last time that's why I asked what's why you asked I was
[00:25:05] unsure who had gone first that is what you said before that is what you said before you said he read before you and you said
[00:25:13] yes - dude look probably did I'm a help is this a slow group do you know the
[00:25:20] physical aspects the listening skills do you know do you yes okay what are they
[00:25:26] you're sitting up straight see that one already right you should look at the
[00:25:31] person who's talking sit up straight or have open body
[00:25:37] posture open body posture is crossed legs no no no aren't you gonna be a good
[00:25:42] listener then fair now this is open body posture shouldn't your legs be apart if
[00:25:48] they're open [Laughter]
[00:26:00] you just said across body position gives the effect that you are not open to what
[00:26:07] someone is saying but when people's body position lay this way then just die I'm
[00:26:15] gonna make a sign and hold it up the Frog is stop when you get to wordy and you just did do you all the physical
[00:26:24] aspects listening skills or not apparently not oh I don't think you do you certainly don't have an open body
[00:26:30] posture do you know the physical aspects of listening skills no no do you know missile let you got a real open body
[00:26:36] posture you don't you darlin I guess so you can learn can't you I'll try you'll try you might be one of the good ones
[00:26:42] right now when your hand is up it means you're not thinking about what is being
[00:26:47] said you're thinking about what you're going to say you blue-eyed people think that I look angry you're the only ones
[00:26:54] who think I look angry I don't look angry to these brown-eyed people perception is everything
[00:27:01] white people look vicious and ugly and non caring and cruel and arrogant and
[00:27:10] powerful and condescending and angry are
[00:27:18] you angry oh good for you you angry
[00:27:23] trying not to be now is that take a lot of energy yes yes are you holding it in yes and are you trying really really
[00:27:30] hard not to react to me yes yes and are you trying really hard not to look at me yes why because I don't make myself more
[00:27:38] upset you don't want to make yourself more upset by looking at me right does
[00:27:43] that take a lot of time a lot of energy yes is that hard for you yes could you
[00:27:48] develop an ulcer over this no you had to do it every day what would happen to your blood pressure
[00:27:55] yeah somebody stood over you you know it was gonna happen every day or you
[00:28:01] expected it to happen every day or it happened when you didn't expect it to or
[00:28:06] it happened to your kids every day after it happened to your mother every day now
[00:28:12] getting right along your hand is still up you still didn't learn anything did you didn't I just say when your hand is
[00:28:18] up you are thinking of what you're going to say instead of what's being said didn't I just say that yes and did you
[00:28:24] hear that and did you decide that you were just gonna do it your way I was now since you
[00:28:34] choose to not listen to others what do you suppose we are going to do where
[00:28:39] you're concerned no listening to me thank you very much doctor no no because
[00:28:44] you're still thinking what you're going to say instead of what I'm saying now dang right along I heard you're
[00:28:51] doing it again what you're doing it again I don't care doing it again wrong you're
[00:28:56] are you doing it again persecuted her for standing you're doing it again so cuted him for standing up the only
[00:29:01] change it ever happens
[00:29:06] Martin Luther King jr. was shot are you in any physical danger here are you in
[00:29:13] any physical danger here is that girl in any physical danger here
[00:29:20] Emmett Till was hanged by his neck after he was beaten almost to death simply
[00:29:26] because he said made a statement to a white woman
[00:29:36] every time I do the exercise there is a point at which I know I have made the
[00:29:42] point and we could stop there but you have to nail it down and so it goes on
[00:29:48] longer then some people think it should but you have to nail it down people at this institution thank you very much
[00:29:56] what is my point that I've made but I can't make generalizations about any places everywhere that's right and while
[00:30:03] it may be no no no you don't come back
[00:30:13] in here until you've apologized every person in this room because you just exercised of freedom that none of these
[00:30:19] peoples color has when these people of color get tired of rate of racism they
[00:30:25] can't just walk out because there's no place in this country where they aren't going to be exposed to racism they can't
[00:30:32] even stay in their own homes and not be exposed to racism if they turn on the television but you as a white female
[00:30:37] when you get tired of being judged and treated unfairly on the basis of your eye color you can walk out that door and
[00:30:42] you know it won't happen out there you exercise the freedom they don't have if you're going to be in here you're going
[00:30:48] to apologize to every black person in this room and do it now
[00:30:54] and Latinos every person approaches ISM this country no you're not
[00:31:01] gonna say I'm sorry there's racism you're going to apologize for what you just did I will not apologize because
[00:31:09] not a matter of ice always out now
[00:31:20] is she choosing to leave yes she could apologize and stay I won't play the
[00:31:27] wrong game anymore okay they got her is
[00:31:41] it gonna hurt her to avoid interaction it is kitty is kidding yes
[00:31:47] it's killing her with these people they felt like it was somewhat dramatic and
[00:31:52] I'm thinking how is this so traumatic when they were accursed nobody was throwing anything at them they worry
[00:31:58] here if they were just getting upset over minor stuff that happened so I thought that happens to us every day but
[00:32:06] they don't realize it one of our students left because she had the right to make the choice whether to stay or go
[00:32:12] students of color do not have the right to make the choice her walking out
[00:32:18] showed frustration not only of her as a white person but of many people of color
[00:32:24] and I kind of think that that that if somebody didn't walk out that it really
[00:32:32] wouldn't articulate what we want to do every day we all want to walk out we all want to get away from the problem but we
[00:32:40] can't you think she's learning anything in the hall probably not did she choose
[00:32:46] then not to learn yes yes because the learning situation
[00:32:51] is not one in which she feels comfortable or in which she feels secure so what does she do
[00:32:57] leaves not lots of people of color blacks Latinos Native Americans Asian
[00:33:04] Americans drop out well they don't drop out they get pushed
[00:33:10] out we create an unwelcoming environment for those who are other than white and
[00:33:17] whose lifestyles may be different and whose culture may be different and we make it uncomfortable enough for them
[00:33:23] that they decide to leave and lose the education or lose the job which means
[00:33:31] they lose their living they leave as a
[00:33:37] result of putting up with it for years and years and years and years and they risk a great deal she risk anything by
[00:33:42] leaving no the only thing that she's going to miss is the learning I think
[00:33:48] the exercise does indeed make them more aware things are better than they were when I was 13 they're not as good as
[00:33:55] they were when I was 50 now I want you to take out a clean sheet of paper don't
[00:34:00] tear it out just turn over your turn the page on the top of the next page on your
[00:34:07] writing tablet I want at the left-hand side on the top line I want you to write
[00:34:13] the words how they looked how they looked on the top line how they vote
[00:34:26] then I want you to write three adjectives not nouns not verbs not
[00:34:32] adverbs adjectives describing how the people in the other group looked to you
[00:34:38] during this exercise everybody put your eye color brown and on brown with the top of that paper people in the middle
[00:34:45] put nine Brown people on the outside put brown yes
[00:34:50] [Music] you don't have a choice you have to be one of the other does everybody have to
[00:34:56] choose yes yes when you go to apply for a job and it says color race where it
[00:35:04] says race I quote human where it says sex I click yeah read yours confused
[00:35:13] frustrated confused any of you confused or are you confused about why all this
[00:35:21] was going on in this fashion why all this was going on in this fashion do any of you understand why this was going on
[00:35:27] in this fashion yes what do you understand about what was going on in this fashion it was a chance for
[00:35:34] everyone here to see what it's like for the people who haven't had to deal with this kind of thing or who haven't at the
[00:35:39] same magnitude to have to deal with it for just six or seven hours and see what happens to the six or seven hours you've
[00:35:46] only been in here since 9:30 I don't even know what time it is right now that's an important point he doesn't
[00:35:53] know what time it is but it feels like six or seven colleges all right now
[00:35:59] leave three lines under your last adjective leave three lines and put the
[00:36:04] words how I felt on the next line how I felt and write three adjectives that
[00:36:10] describe how you felt during this exercise read your Shepherds have said
[00:36:17] foolish apprehensive sad how many of you were sad anybody sad or you sad about
[00:36:26] that you would teach this that I would teach this in the manner that I chose
[00:36:33] like fighting fire with fire that what that works yeah I mean I I was already I
[00:36:40] already need a lesson I'm not really playing a game either so you're I wasn't intimidated by you
[00:36:45] because I don't I don't have I don't believe that you've let power over me and I don't believe that I have however
[00:36:50] then you sitting on the floor you wearing that collar did you drop your
[00:36:55] head and not grin when I told you to drop your head and not grin I want to credit I went to get it that way yeah were you willing to do this to get the
[00:37:01] credit yes yes so can I'm gonna do it you yes you can't but you can't you can't you get it I sold you can do it I
[00:37:08] do I care about your soul let me make something perfectly clear here this is not about your soul but but the lesson
[00:37:14] that you're trying to teach is you're trying to change people's soul good we're talking wait a minute you're dividing me American okay you're Native
[00:37:23] Americans you can pass this way can't you think you could pass when you want to can't you huh and you pass when it's
[00:37:29] good for you don't you I guess so I don't do an intention now as a Native American you know a whole lot more about
[00:37:35] being discriminated against then a whole lot of white folks do but you still
[00:37:42] because you can pass probably don't know as much about being discriminated against actively discriminated against
[00:37:49] in this country as blacks who are obviously black you can pass people won't know you're
[00:37:58] Native American unless you tell them can you pass that first I was I was really
[00:38:06] angry and I hope that I could actually like I would take her down that was kind of like the the reaction that I had I
[00:38:12] don't know dude do you do you actively tell people you're Native American how
[00:38:19] many times without within a conversation have you gone oh you know I'm Native
[00:38:25] American I don't I don't talk about my culture at all so what do you think
[00:38:31] people see when they see you today say oh you might be you know Native American
[00:38:37] do they see white eye I mean that's what they see but I you know I can't I can't
[00:38:42] ask them to see more than that but I would hope that they would see me when
[00:38:49] people go through this exercise I see this happen every time it's very similar to going through the five stages of
[00:38:56] grief first they deny that what I'm saying about them is true then they get angry you've seen that happen then they go
[00:39:03] into the bargaining stage then they get depressed then they accept it and go along with it
[00:39:09] I tell people that I want to make a change to become active to become aware
[00:39:14] to educate themselves and then to act on what they know but to act not to stand
[00:39:21] idly by the only thing necessary for the perpetuation of evil is for good people
[00:39:26] to do nothing I want the people who are exposed to me to be determined to do
[00:39:32] something make no mistake about this this is not fun I'll go home tonight and I'll have migraine headaches for two
[00:39:38] days I'll have two days of migraine headaches because doing this exercises is in total opposition to what I believe
[00:39:45] in this is absolutely in opposition to everything that I believe in everything
[00:39:50] I've taught my children but I happen to think that this exercise can make a
[00:39:56] difference in people's behaviors and in their understanding of other people
[00:40:01] now that doesn't make me willing to suffer I'm not willing to suffer but if
[00:40:06] you raise that hand I'm going to break it off and hit you over the head with it but don't you think I want you to suffer
[00:40:11] I think this exercise is important and I
[00:40:17] know this exercise worked I know it worked
[00:40:23] I know it worked I know it could make a difference if you chose to let it make a
[00:40:29] difference that's worth having a migraine headache for make no mistake about that if I could change one person
[00:40:37] so that when he or she left here today they would be different from what they were when they came in if I could make
[00:40:43] one white person in this room a different kind of person than I was when I was your age that would make a
[00:40:50] migraine headache worth it what have you learned honestly I've learned a lot of
[00:40:55] things I've learned that you can compare the stages of loss to the loss of power
[00:41:02] and does that sound logical to you yeah it does did that is that what happened in here this morning yeah that's so soon
[00:41:08] is that sick yeah yeah yeah that's sick yeah that's sick that's sick yeah
[00:41:15] there's no doubt about that and if it's sick in this room with this many
[00:41:21] students while theirs is out of here on a daily basis I feel that you're making an assumption that that the the biggest
[00:41:30] hurt is through black-and-white issues and that might be true
[00:41:35] however I feel that that there are those who have gone through a lot of pain and
[00:41:42] prejudice by not being black it has nothing to do with a race issue but has
[00:41:49] every other has to do with every other issue and so it seems like you're assuming that he has hurt more than I
[00:41:58] have simply because he his his issue is more prominent than mine and do I know
[00:42:06] what your issue is no I know do I know what his issue is you're making us I
[00:42:12] mean do I know what his issue is do I have you're making the assumption
[00:42:19] that yes but you don't know his his day-to-day do I know how people of this
[00:42:25] society has historically and today treats people of color yes yes carry
[00:42:32] doesn't want to hear carry wants I think that carry is determined to see this
[00:42:40] from her own agenda and no matter how often you tell her you have choice
[00:42:46] people of color have no choice carry she can change her clothes she can change
[00:42:51] her hair she can change her ornamentation people of color can't change their color I think I have
[00:42:58] experienced enough of my my own pain to be able to say that on the inside how
[00:43:05] different could we really be and I felt like when I was in the middle group all
[00:43:10] of my previous experiences with judgment and Prejudice etc were being invalidated
[00:43:17] Venice
[00:43:23] remember you stand right yeah you folks see any
[00:43:29] differences here you see any differences here what's the sex it's sex important
[00:43:42] to you yes why so strong powerful your
[00:43:55] gender is important to you yes do you want to be seen as a male yes yes to you
[00:44:03] when I see you I don't see you male no has anybody ever said to you when I see
[00:44:08] you I don't see you got yes yes now you see when I asked me does anybody ever
[00:44:13] said to you when I see you I don't see you may leave chuckle and laugh that's funny but nobody laughed when I said has anybody said I don't see you black now
[00:44:21] she doesn't see your difference is your difference important to you yes yes but on the other hand a minute is your
[00:44:28] agenda is important to you that you're female no it isn't you don't bring anything different to the table
[00:44:34] then what a male would bring to the table yes historically and yes idly what not individually perspective your
[00:44:40] perspective is not different from his of course my perspective is different but I don't think it's because I'm female I
[00:44:46] think in this sense that I mean yes and no because of our different physical
[00:44:51] attributes are you as powerful as he is I don't know are you as strong as he is
[00:44:57] physically no but then is that a difference yes it is yes does that make a difference in how you have to behave
[00:45:03] it depends can he go places safely securely that you probably can't because of his size
[00:45:09] because of his gender she say honey and securely
[00:45:14] it depends what is I'm sorry okay yes depends you know he
[00:45:21] can't all right let me put it this way how many of you see rah su as black did
[00:45:27] you know you were black before they said so as your color imported you very
[00:45:34] important and your height is important you yes and why is your color important to you this is who I am it is who you
[00:45:39] are it's not that I want to invalidate in any way shape or form Rasool's hurt
[00:45:47] and I realize that it's entirely different from mine it shouldn't be that way however it is gender is a part of me
[00:45:54] in the same way the color skin is a part of me so I'm not going to deny that I'm not going to say that it doesn't make me
[00:45:59] different and that my experiences haven't shaped Who I am but I think what I was trying to say was it doesn't
[00:46:07] matter in the end if I'm male or female is it important for you that she sees
[00:46:13] you as you are not as just like everybody else yes yes when you say to a person of color when I see you I don't
[00:46:20] see you Black Mage's see everybody the same people think about that you don't have the right to say to a person I do
[00:46:26] not see you as you are I want to see you as I would be more comfortable seeing you I wanted to make it plain to the
[00:46:32] class that the first thing we do see is black and white maybe was a good thing maybe is a bad but it's something that
[00:46:38] we have to come to and say and agree and just be open with it like yes he's black
[00:46:45] I see it Rasual came away with a knowledge of how the power system works
[00:46:50] and that's extremely important and I think with the knowledge that it isn't
[00:46:56] his imagination we live in different realities but when you deny what this person is going to or what this version
[00:47:02] is going through you're denying their reality we are different on the outside
[00:47:07] are you the same on the inside we're both 11 p.m. but we're not Oh have you ever been
[00:47:15] pregnant no so are you and I the same on the inside no absolutely are you and I
[00:47:21] the same on the inside absolutely our psychology is the same no the psychology of whites is not the same as this
[00:47:27] ecology of blacks or Native Americans or Latinos or Asian Americans male psychology isn't the same as female
[00:47:33] psychology the psychology of the young isn't the same as the psychology of the old whereas different on the inside as we are on the outside and we have the
[00:47:39] right to be so people don't deny differences accept them appreciate them
[00:47:48] recognize them and cherish them they are extremely important I think the exercise
[00:47:54] does indeed make them more aware and I think it does indeed make them to have them have allowed them to have more
[00:48:00] empathy I know it does I think it changes the way they think about themselves in their environment I think
[00:48:05] it changes the way they perceive others I think it changes the way they perceive their own power the exercise is over you
[00:48:14] don't have to worry about your eye color anymore and some of you still don't have to worry about your skin color but some
[00:48:21] of the rest of you do so I can end this exercise or you can
[00:48:27] say no it isn't over for me I will never forget this and I will make something better happen because of this exercise
[00:48:32] you can choose to do that or not - yeah that choice the thing is you have their
[00:48:40] choice and you have their choice and I have that choice and you have that choice and people of color have no choice they have
[00:48:45] to fight this battle every day this is what I choose to do this is what he has
[00:48:52] no choice about
[00:48:57] [Music]
[00:49:06] I think they're going to make a difference here this is the real world
[00:49:11] and when they leave here and go into the so-called real world I think they're going to carry that decision and that
[00:49:17] commitment with them because once you make a little difference then that gives you that encourages you to keep on
[00:49:25] I think that I see things completely differently now I see I see I got to
[00:49:33] experience some of my own strengths and weaknesses I got to experience some of
[00:49:39] my sensitivities and at the same time my ability to still stand up even though I
[00:49:46] felt like curling into a ball at the end I felt like I felt very powerfully my
[00:49:52] roommate has said to me you know I've seen a different person in you but you change a little bit like that it is my
[00:49:59] duty to change society and it is my duty to do what I have to do to make sure that my children know both the same
[00:50:05] that I've lost in my whole life every experience you have is an opportunity to see yourself in a new way and if you
[00:50:11] close your mind to that if you say I didn't learn anything from this experience and I say sucks to be you what am I going to quit
[00:50:19] when racists quit do I have a job for a lifetime I'm afraid soul

I consider this exercise and injection of the live virus of racism if you've been through this exercise the next time you see racist behaviors sexist behaviors homophobic behaviors that's know centric behaviors Aegis behaviors maybe you will say to yourself wait a minute I had that for one morning I'm never going to allow that to happen in my presence again without responding to it negatively [Music] over the course of two and a half hours on a Saturday morning 24 American college students participated in an experience which would change their lives it seemed like a good idea at the time I don't know I haven't given it much thought I usually get up this early I think it's just going to be people talking about their political views and some people we see some stupid comments that it's gonna heat up their room I really don't know what to expect I just expect a lot of argument about things that we don't necessarily agree on [Music] take a nametag put your name on and then sign in according to the color of your eyes you didn't hear what I said take a nametag [Music] pick a name day they're gonna put your name on it then sign in a flirty color of your eyes you sit here we're into that room right there stay there until I come for you down ground sit down brown-eyed right around the corner that room right there you're always where that captain building sit down give you a little nicer please what it's girly in the morning you have my sympathy now let me tell you something all you have to do is do exactly what I say exactly when I tell you to exactly as I say it if I tell you to take your cap off you take your cap off if I need no I do not have to ask you nicely now get over that idea right now you got it now move your leg in that room Branagh when the nice ready Brown I go into this room right around the port [Music] move your leg don't remove this reason [Music] I have a dream my four little children one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character I have a dream today the day after Martin Luther King jr. was killed I decided to do an exercise that would help my students to understand racism I tried to make a difference I'm still trying to make that difference we do not treated our brothers I feel people need this because we are still doing now what we were doing in the fifties is there anything about you people that is different from one another that we could use to make part of you [Music] okay we could use the car of your eye huh me and you hear that blue-eyed okay how many in here I'm Brown it might be interesting to judge of people today by the color of their eyes I'm trying to get the people who participate in this exercise the opportunity to find out how it feels to be something other than white in this society all right people I'm Jane Elliott I'm your resident for the day and make no mistake about that that's exactly what this is about I do this in a mean nasty way because racism sexism ageism homophobia ethnocentrism are mean and nasty today I am here because I have been asked to do an exercise and discrimination based on eye color now the purpose of this exercise is to give these nice blue-eyed white kids the opportunity to spend about an hour and a half to two hours on the receiving end of the treatment which we meet out to people of color on a daily basis in this country they're in a blue eyed holding room right now they are not eating they are not drinking there are three chairs in there for 12 people we're going to bring these people in here you're going to treat them as though they're inferior because they are inferior everybody understand that they're not going to learn because they can't learn and because we're going to set it up so they can't learn and if they succeed who has failed we have do people want to fail no if they get power who loses power we do you I lose power no for 400 years in this country we've been basing our judgment of people on the color of their skin eye color and skin color are caused by the same chemical melanin if you had a lot of melanin and your hair your skin in your eyes you have very dark hair very dark guys and very dark skin if you have only a little melanin in your skin your hair and your you have light skin light hair and light eyes these people all have too little melanin in their eyes so obviously they aren't as smart as we are we're going to accuse them of not being as smart as we are when you accuse them is not of not being as clean as we are we're going to lower our expectations for them we're going to force them to live down to our expectation of them and when they do we're going to blame their inability to perform on the color of their eyes now in order to get them in their chat into their adult ego state we're going to try to teach them the listening skills now what do we call men that we want to keep in their childlike state boys we're gonna call these males boy you're not going to use their given name you're going to call it and boy are you going to call them bluey or you're going to call them fool people what do we call women besides chicks honey baby gal doll face doll dumpling they're all here are they packed it up we are going to give them no respect how many of you have friends in that group let me put it this way how many of you used to have friends in that group because some of these people are going to leave here very angry because they choose to be angry and if they say to you that made me mad and I'll never forgive you for that you need to say to them you had it for two and a half hours one day one day in your life you had it for two and a half hours and you're still angry about it how often how often have you been discriminated against on the basis of the color of your skin number of days more than once in your lifetime more than two and a half hours in your lifetime so yeah since the day you were born has it happened to you recently can you put the chairs back the way they were put the chair back the way they were right people's number one freedom in the United States of America is the freedom to be totally ignorant about those who are other than white we don't have to learn about those who are other than white and our number two freedom is the freedom to deny that were ignorant today we're going to take away these people's freedom to be ignorant I want you to understand how the system works and believe me this is how the system works we make laws to support white superiority and to reinforce white superiority and when you catch on to how it works then we change the laws I didn't invent this exercise I learned this from Adolf Hitler one of the ways they decided when into the gas chamber was I color this exercise is not without precedent [Music] now look at this watch look at him should we just sit in should we just sit anywhere if you came into a room in which the chairs were arranged in this way and the brown-eyed people were sitting in these chairs in this way and nobody was sitting in the chairs in the middle where would you sit in the middle that would make sense to me what it makes sense to you where are you going get in the blue-eyed section the blue-eyed section is in the middle of the room get there you're a non Brown as far as I'm concerned you're a bully now this one giggling what do you know about him because he's ignored what else do you know about it he's and he has a little kid little child's ego state isn't he get up here and sit down on the floor you together and sit down on the floor I was really tired when I entered the room but I didn't have any expectations I was just sitting there and wondering how it could be an emotional experience because I had signed the paper that had warned me about ulcers and stress conditions and things like this so I was curious and there are a few mumbles about how it was going to go what are you going to do that's right waiting for someone to take care of them there in their child legal state what are you gonna do what do you do what do you say when you walk across someone try excuse me certainly thank you I don't think anybody really knew what was gonna happen nobody told us ahead of time they just told us to show up at a certain time it didn't take very long before intimidation set in and before my my buttons were pushed now well I've been talking some of you have been sitting there reading the signs I'm not gonna put up with that and you longer so you in the back room stand up and read the first line on that wall back there only brown eyes need apply radio so we can hear you only brown eyes need apply next blue eyes stand up and read the next line Braille watch this one watch this one fits two flexes sit down again then stand up for us stand up that's better now I'll read the next sign blue-eyes shouldn't hold political office next why can't a blue-eyed be more than like your brown read it again get it right this time well I can't a blue I be more likely Brown read it again get it right this time pronounce each one of those words correctly as they're written why can't a blue eye be more like a brown what's the word and it found a blue hey that's the letter A what word is that read over get it right why can't a blue-eyed be more like a brown now practice one more time why can't a blue-eyed be more like a brown next next I'm not prejudiced some of my best friends of blue-eyed how many of you've ever heard that one before in another form oh yes favorite claim of liberals right I'm not prejudiced on my best friends are black as any person ever said to you a good liberal person ever said to you when I see you I don't see you black how many of you have had that experience when I see you I don't see you black and what do you say to them when they say that but I am but I am and then what do they say is there but I don't see color I don't see color how many of you think they do see color well people if they didn't see color they wouldn't say when I see you I don't see you but because they wouldn't see black what they so you immediately know that they're lying don't you yeah there they are lying there saying I don't see your color you can't say I don't see color cuz they need to be seeing in black and white and that would be a really weird world to see if everything was black and white we would be some really messed up people it happens to me on a date the bases in institution oh man and there's really no way around it cuz whether people do it intentionally or not what am I supposed to do you don't have to take that and I take it you don't take it good for you good for you because as long as you say oh thank you and do you know black people who would say oh thank you yes how many of you know black people would say oh thanks I'm glad you don't see me by and by john cena color your skin is only the largest organ on your body right probably the part of the exercise I didn't I had the most trouble with was when I was forced to realize that I have something that I didn't want to give up that I'm in a position that other people aren't in you know there are other people in my position but not everybody has that and that it's not fair for me to protect that the day these kids these white kids are in this exercise they see themselves as other people see them for the first time in their lives you know the physical aspects of those new skills you're afraid not what about you definitely not what about you a bit a bit yes so tell me what the bit is that you know I'm a bit that I know is that you stand up straight you look at the person who's speaking and you hear tension to what they're saying what if you're sitting down I am sitting down then you can't listen right unless I sit him down oh you just said you stand up straight I said you sit up straight you did she say you sit up straighter did you say you stand on the break is this a universal problem with Boyd people you have a paper and pencil with you no do you over in your bag why is it in your bag because that's where I keep it that's where you keep it why did you put your paper and pencil over there because I was not I did not know when I was going to be meeting you came to a learning experience right yes you ever go to a learning experience before yes do you ever take notes yes what did you use I used a paper paper and pencil and did you keep it with you so that you could take notes yes yes why didn't you do that this time because I was not planning on taking notes you weren't planning on taking notes you think you can remember everything that's going to be done in here and said in here not word-for-word not word-for-word so what should you have done I probably she's gonna say I probably shouldn't read what should you have done I should have brought my paper and pencil over here and kept it with me that's right time that's right you're acting angry I am angry what are you angry about I'm angry that you're yelling at me do you hear me yelling let's see I mean have I done that yep okay you're using your stern voice are you are you defining me no I'm not officially defining me does she say I'm yelling what I'm not perception is everything do you feel like I'm yelling at you yes yes why because you're using a stern voice mustard honey it isn't my fault you're stupid would you like me to go get my paper and pencil I wouldn't like you in any way shape or form okay let's get that understood here this isn't a matter of whether I like you or not repeat after me one-hand one-hand one-hand took not hand hen hen hen lays eggs one-hand one-hand one-hand two ducks one hand to death one hand two ducks three squawking geese one hand two ducks three squawking games one hand two ducks three squawking geese four Limerick oysters one hand two ducks three squawking geese for Hamrick wasters America oysters I'm sorry Limerick moisture one hand two ducks three squawking geese Portland records there's five corpulent for purposes you can remember everything honey which isn't hard for you go for it one hand two ducks three squawking geese for Limerick oysters five I forget the other one I'm sorry so maybe you would have been better off if you could have taken notes for this right I do not find the need to take notes for that I'm going to ask you to remember this for the rest of this time next one six pairs of darnell varsity's tweezers start with one one hand two ducks three squawking geese for it Limerick oysters five I do not know six I forget you're gonna have to know this I'm going to keep testing you on this what would be a good idea for you to have paper paper and pencil very unless the beginning of wisdom now 7,000 Macedonians in full battle array start from one there always no other numbers other than one two three start with one one and two ducks three Limerick three squawking geeks four Limerick oysters fine I still don't remember that number six I still don't remember that and 7,000 and whatever he said I'm sorry eight brass monkeys from the ancient sacred crypts of Egypt start with one do you wish you had a paper and pencil no do you think you're going to need one if I keep testing you on that yes then are you gonna wish you had a paper and pencil yes yes in the future what are you gonna do when you go to learning situation and keep it with me you did you learn anything yes do you appreciate what you just learned yes did you like the way it was taught no no any of the rest of you ever taught in that fashion yes and did you have to express appreciation for it yeah could you learn something from her example what are you crying about what are you crying about feeling sorry how are your feelings hurt just ordered should I feel sorry for her I expect you to did I feel sorry for her some of you are thinking all this is too harsh for this young woman James Byrd black man in Texas dragged to death behind a pickup truck by three white males Matthew Shepard master Shepard young man about your little Oh a little younger you are had the misfortune to be born gay beaten beaten with a pistol about the head until they cracked his skull and then they hung him on a deer fence and left him there overnight and somebody coming along on a bicycle the next day saw a bunch of clothing hanging on this deer fence and they went over and started take the clothing off the deer fence and found a body in the clothing I'm sorry but those things happen because we live in a society in which people are allowed to treat those who are different in an ugly way because of their differences I cannot shed tears for a young white female in this exercise who knows that this is an exercise who knows that it's temporary who knows that she's getting like college credit one hour of credit for being here I'm sorry I have to save my sympathy and my empathy for those who go through something much worse than this every day of their lives and when they complain about it we say you took it wrong or we say it wasn't racism you feel real sorry for not really really why not because she really didn't I don't see where she was hurt in any way I mean but don't be fine her but as far as you're concerned is this tough it's tough as you make it yeah but could you do this yeah you do yeah have you ever been in the situation they're in sometimes yes yes and would crying have gotten you out of it no no and when crying I've gotten your sympathies and would that have solve the problem no no and when somebody has said get over it yeah yeah yeah tears were coming in my eyes and when I saw these people kind of like but it wasn't for them it was for the fact that I know people who are going through that right now while you're sitting in that classroom and had the privilege and the time the opportunity to be going through an experiment that there are people outside who go through that 10 times worse than any student color in that room you don't know which side do you blue eyes make good secretaries in that nice how many of you have heard that one before how many of you think she got the right sign which time did you read the one that says blue eyes make good secretary you read that once she thought we didn't hear you if I have but one life let me live it as a brown now we're making progress here right when she read that sign and you lied to me one two three you read that sign this one you liked me I wasn't sure how many of you think she sounded unsure she knew what she was talking about how many think she's lying now how many of you think she was finding excuses for making a mistake before and was willing to say he read before me the last time that's the reason I asked did he read before her the last time that's why I asked what's why you asked I was unsure who had gone first that is what you said before that is what you said before you said he read before you and you said yes - dude look probably did I'm a help is this a slow group do you know the physical aspects the listening skills do you know do you yes okay what are they you're sitting up straight see that one already right you should look at the person who's talking sit up straight or have open body posture open body posture is crossed legs no no no aren't you gonna be a good listener then fair now this is open body posture shouldn't your legs be apart if they're open [Laughter] you just said across body position gives the effect that you are not open to what someone is saying but when people's body position lay this way then just die I'm gonna make a sign and hold it up the Frog is stop when you get to wordy and you just did do you all the physical aspects listening skills or not apparently not oh I don't think you do you certainly don't have an open body posture do you know the physical aspects of listening skills no no do you know missile let you got a real open body posture you don't you darlin I guess so you can learn can't you I'll try you'll try you might be one of the good ones right now when your hand is up it means you're not thinking about what is being said you're thinking about what you're going to say you blue-eyed people think that I look angry you're the only ones who think I look angry I don't look angry to these brown-eyed people perception is everything white people look vicious and ugly and non caring and cruel and arrogant and powerful and condescending and angry are you angry oh good for you you angry trying not to be now is that take a lot of energy yes yes are you holding it in yes and are you trying really really hard not to react to me yes yes and are you trying really hard not to look at me yes why because I don't make myself more upset you don't want to make yourself more upset by looking at me right does that take a lot of time a lot of energy yes is that hard for you yes could you develop an ulcer over this no you had to do it every day what would happen to your blood pressure yeah somebody stood over you you know it was gonna happen every day or you expected it to happen every day or it happened when you didn't expect it to or it happened to your kids every day after it happened to your mother every day now getting right along your hand is still up you still didn't learn anything did you didn't I just say when your hand is up you are thinking of what you're going to say instead of what's being said didn't I just say that yes and did you hear that and did you decide that you were just gonna do it your way I was now since you choose to not listen to others what do you suppose we are going to do where you're concerned no listening to me thank you very much doctor no no because you're still thinking what you're going to say instead of what I'm saying now dang right along I heard you're doing it again what you're doing it again I don't care doing it again wrong you're are you doing it again persecuted her for standing you're doing it again so cuted him for standing up the only change it ever happens Martin Luther King jr. was shot are you in any physical danger here are you in any physical danger here is that girl in any physical danger here Emmett Till was hanged by his neck after he was beaten almost to death simply because he said made a statement to a white woman every time I do the exercise there is a point at which I know I have made the point and we could stop there but you have to nail it down and so it goes on longer then some people think it should but you have to nail it down people at this institution thank you very much what is my point that I've made but I can't make generalizations about any places everywhere that's right and while it may be no no no you don't come back in here until you've apologized every person in this room because you just exercised of freedom that none of these peoples color has when these people of color get tired of rate of racism they can't just walk out because there's no place in this country where they aren't going to be exposed to racism they can't even stay in their own homes and not be exposed to racism if they turn on the television but you as a white female when you get tired of being judged and treated unfairly on the basis of your eye color you can walk out that door and you know it won't happen out there you exercise the freedom they don't have if you're going to be in here you're going to apologize to every black person in this room and do it now and Latinos every person approaches ISM this country no you're not gonna say I'm sorry there's racism you're going to apologize for what you just did I will not apologize because not a matter of ice always out now is she choosing to leave yes she could apologize and stay I won't play the wrong game anymore okay they got her is it gonna hurt her to avoid interaction it is kitty is kidding yes it's killing her with these people they felt like it was somewhat dramatic and I'm thinking how is this so traumatic when they were accursed nobody was throwing anything at them they worry here if they were just getting upset over minor stuff that happened so I thought that happens to us every day but they don't realize it one of our students left because she had the right to make the choice whether to stay or go students of color do not have the right to make the choice her walking out showed frustration not only of her as a white person but of many people of color and I kind of think that that that if somebody didn't walk out that it really wouldn't articulate what we want to do every day we all want to walk out we all want to get away from the problem but we can't you think she's learning anything in the hall probably not did she choose then not to learn yes yes because the learning situation is not one in which she feels comfortable or in which she feels secure so what does she do leaves not lots of people of color blacks Latinos Native Americans Asian Americans drop out well they don't drop out they get pushed out we create an unwelcoming environment for those who are other than white and whose lifestyles may be different and whose culture may be different and we make it uncomfortable enough for them that they decide to leave and lose the education or lose the job which means they lose their living they leave as a result of putting up with it for years and years and years and years and they risk a great deal she risk anything by leaving no the only thing that she's going to miss is the learning I think the exercise does indeed make them more aware things are better than they were when I was 13 they're not as good as they were when I was 50 now I want you to take out a clean sheet of paper don't tear it out just turn over your turn the page on the top of the next page on your writing tablet I want at the left-hand side on the top line I want you to write the words how they looked how they looked on the top line how they vote then I want you to write three adjectives not nouns not verbs not adverbs adjectives describing how the people in the other group looked to you during this exercise everybody put your eye color brown and on brown with the top of that paper people in the middle put nine Brown people on the outside put brown yes [Music] you don't have a choice you have to be one of the other does everybody have to choose yes yes when you go to apply for a job and it says color race where it says race I quote human where it says sex I click yeah read yours confused frustrated confused any of you confused or are you confused about why all this was going on in this fashion why all this was going on in this fashion do any of you understand why this was going on in this fashion yes what do you understand about what was going on in this fashion it was a chance for everyone here to see what it's like for the people who haven't had to deal with this kind of thing or who haven't at the same magnitude to have to deal with it for just six or seven hours and see what happens to the six or seven hours you've only been in here since 9:30 I don't even know what time it is right now that's an important point he doesn't know what time it is but it feels like six or seven colleges all right now leave three lines under your last adjective leave three lines and put the words how I felt on the next line how I felt and write three adjectives that describe how you felt during this exercise read your Shepherds have said foolish apprehensive sad how many of you were sad anybody sad or you sad about that you would teach this that I would teach this in the manner that I chose like fighting fire with fire that what that works yeah I mean I I was already I already need a lesson I'm not really playing a game either so you're I wasn't intimidated by you because I don't I don't have I don't believe that you've let power over me and I don't believe that I have however then you sitting on the floor you wearing that collar did you drop your head and not grin when I told you to drop your head and not grin I want to credit I went to get it that way yeah were you willing to do this to get the credit yes yes so can I'm gonna do it you yes you can't but you can't you can't you get it I sold you can do it I do I care about your soul let me make something perfectly clear here this is not about your soul but but the lesson that you're trying to teach is you're trying to change people's soul good we're talking wait a minute you're dividing me American okay you're Native Americans you can pass this way can't you think you could pass when you want to can't you huh and you pass when it's good for you don't you I guess so I don't do an intention now as a Native American you know a whole lot more about being discriminated against then a whole lot of white folks do but you still because you can pass probably don't know as much about being discriminated against actively discriminated against in this country as blacks who are obviously black you can pass people won't know you're Native American unless you tell them can you pass that first I was I was really angry and I hope that I could actually like I would take her down that was kind of like the the reaction that I had I don't know dude do you do you actively tell people you're Native American how many times without within a conversation have you gone oh you know I'm Native American I don't I don't talk about my culture at all so what do you think people see when they see you today say oh you might be you know Native American do they see white eye I mean that's what they see but I you know I can't I can't ask them to see more than that but I would hope that they would see me when people go through this exercise I see this happen every time it's very similar to going through the five stages of grief first they deny that what I'm saying about them is true then they get angry you've seen that happen then they go into the bargaining stage then they get depressed then they accept it and go along with it I tell people that I want to make a change to become active to become aware to educate themselves and then to act on what they know but to act not to stand idly by the only thing necessary for the perpetuation of evil is for good people to do nothing I want the people who are exposed to me to be determined to do something make no mistake about this this is not fun I'll go home tonight and I'll have migraine headaches for two days I'll have two days of migraine headaches because doing this exercises is in total opposition to what I believe in this is absolutely in opposition to everything that I believe in everything I've taught my children but I happen to think that this exercise can make a difference in people's behaviors and in their understanding of other people now that doesn't make me willing to suffer I'm not willing to suffer but if you raise that hand I'm going to break it off and hit you over the head with it but don't you think I want you to suffer I think this exercise is important and I know this exercise worked I know it worked I know it worked I know it could make a difference if you chose to let it make a difference that's worth having a migraine headache for make no mistake about that if I could change one person so that when he or she left here today they would be different from what they were when they came in if I could make one white person in this room a different kind of person than I was when I was your age that would make a migraine headache worth it what have you learned honestly I've learned a lot of things I've learned that you can compare the stages of loss to the loss of power and does that sound logical to you yeah it does did that is that what happened in here this morning yeah that's so soon is that sick yeah yeah yeah that's sick yeah that's sick that's sick yeah there's no doubt about that and if it's sick in this room with this many students while theirs is out of here on a daily basis I feel that you're making an assumption that that the the biggest hurt is through black-and-white issues and that might be true however I feel that that there are those who have gone through a lot of pain and prejudice by not being black it has nothing to do with a race issue but has every other has to do with every other issue and so it seems like you're assuming that he has hurt more than I have simply because he his his issue is more prominent than mine and do I know what your issue is no I know do I know what his issue is you're making us I mean do I know what his issue is do I have you're making the assumption that yes but you don't know his his day-to-day do I know how people of this society has historically and today treats people of color yes yes carry doesn't want to hear carry wants I think that carry is determined to see this from her own agenda and no matter how often you tell her you have choice people of color have no choice carry she can change her clothes she can change her hair she can change her ornamentation people of color can't change their color I think I have experienced enough of my my own pain to be able to say that on the inside how different could we really be and I felt like when I was in the middle group all of my previous experiences with judgment and Prejudice etc were being invalidated Venice remember you stand right yeah you folks see any differences here you see any differences here what's the sex it's sex important to you yes why so strong powerful your gender is important to you yes do you want to be seen as a male yes yes to you when I see you I don't see you male no has anybody ever said to you when I see you I don't see you got yes yes now you see when I asked me does anybody ever said to you when I see you I don't see you may leave chuckle and laugh that's funny but nobody laughed when I said has anybody said I don't see you black now she doesn't see your difference is your difference important to you yes yes but on the other hand a minute is your agenda is important to you that you're female no it isn't you don't bring anything different to the table then what a male would bring to the table yes historically and yes idly what not individually perspective your perspective is not different from his of course my perspective is different but I don't think it's because I'm female I think in this sense that I mean yes and no because of our different physical attributes are you as powerful as he is I don't know are you as strong as he is physically no but then is that a difference yes it is yes does that make a difference in how you have to behave it depends can he go places safely securely that you probably can't because of his size because of his gender she say honey and securely it depends what is I'm sorry okay yes depends you know he can't all right let me put it this way how many of you see rah su as black did you know you were black before they said so as your color imported you very important and your height is important you yes and why is your color important to you this is who I am it is who you are it's not that I want to invalidate in any way shape or form Rasool's hurt and I realize that it's entirely different from mine it shouldn't be that way however it is gender is a part of me in the same way the color skin is a part of me so I'm not going to deny that I'm not going to say that it doesn't make me different and that my experiences haven't shaped Who I am but I think what I was trying to say was it doesn't matter in the end if I'm male or female is it important for you that she sees you as you are not as just like everybody else yes yes when you say to a person of color when I see you I don't see you Black Mage's see everybody the same people think about that you don't have the right to say to a person I do not see you as you are I want to see you as I would be more comfortable seeing you I wanted to make it plain to the class that the first thing we do see is black and white maybe was a good thing maybe is a bad but it's something that we have to come to and say and agree and just be open with it like yes he's black I see it Rasual came away with a knowledge of how the power system works and that's extremely important and I think with the knowledge that it isn't his imagination we live in different realities but when you deny what this person is going to or what this version is going through you're denying their reality we are different on the outside are you the same on the inside we're both 11 p.m. but we're not Oh have you ever been pregnant no so are you and I the same on the inside no absolutely are you and I the same on the inside absolutely our psychology is the same no the psychology of whites is not the same as this ecology of blacks or Native Americans or Latinos or Asian Americans male psychology isn't the same as female psychology the psychology of the young isn't the same as the psychology of the old whereas different on the inside as we are on the outside and we have the right to be so people don't deny differences accept them appreciate them recognize them and cherish them they are extremely important I think the exercise does indeed make them more aware and I think it does indeed make them to have them have allowed them to have more empathy I know it does I think it changes the way they think about themselves in their environment I think it changes the way they perceive others I think it changes the way they perceive their own power the exercise is over you don't have to worry about your eye color anymore and some of you still don't have to worry about your skin color but some of the rest of you do so I can end this exercise or you can say no it isn't over for me I will never forget this and I will make something better happen because of this exercise you can choose to do that or not - yeah that choice the thing is you have their choice and you have their choice and I have that choice and you have that choice and people of color have no choice they have to fight this battle every day this is what I choose to do this is what he has no choice about [Music] I think they're going to make a difference here this is the real world and when they leave here and go into the so-called real world I think they're going to carry that decision and that commitment with them because once you make a little difference then that gives you that encourages you to keep on I think that I see things completely differently now I see I see I got to experience some of my own strengths and weaknesses I got to experience some of my sensitivities and at the same time my ability to still stand up even though I felt like curling into a ball at the end I felt like I felt very powerfully my roommate has said to me you know I've seen a different person in you but you change a little bit like that it is my duty to change society and it is my duty to do what I have to do to make sure that my children know both the same that I've lost in my whole life every experience you have is an opportunity to see yourself in a new way and if you close your mind to that if you say I didn't learn anything from this experience and I say sucks to be you what am I going to quit when racists quit do I have a job for a lifetime I'm afraid soul [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
