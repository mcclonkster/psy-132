<h2>Personality Traits vs Personality Disorders</h2>
<ul>
<li>This lesson explains what psychologists mean by personality traits.</li>
<li>This lesson shows how personality disorders are different from traits.</li>
<li>This lesson helps you avoid casually labeling people with disorders.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Speaker notes:</em><br>
State the main purpose clearly: we are drawing a careful line between normal personality differences and personality disorders. Emphasize that the goal is understanding, not diagnosing people in your life.</p>
</section>
<section id="learning-goals" class="slide level2">
<h2>Learning Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>Define personality and personality traits.</li>
<li>Describe what a personality disorder is.</li>
<li>Explain the key differences between traits and personality disorders.</li>
<li>Apply these ideas to clear, real-world examples.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Speaker notes:</em><br>
You can ask students to restate these in their own words. Say up front: by the end, you should be able to explain this to a friend without using technical terms.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-is-personality" class="slide level2">
<h2>What Is Personality?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Personality is a relatively stable pattern of how you think, feel, and behave.</li>
<li>This pattern shows up across many situations and over time.</li>
<li>Personality helps explain why different people respond differently to the same event.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Speaker notes:</em><br>
Give a simple example: two students get the same grade; one shrugs it off, one rewrites their whole plan. Same event, different personality patterns. Keep it concrete.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-are-personality-traits" class="slide level2">
<h2>What Are Personality Traits?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Personality traits are basic dimensions of how people tend to act, think, and feel.</li>
<li>Traits are like sliders that can be higher or lower in different people.</li>
<li>A wide range of trait levels is normal in the general population.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Speaker notes:</em><br>
If you like, briefly name common trait ideas (such as being more outgoing or more reserved, more organized or more spontaneous). Stress that none of these are automatically “good” or “bad.”</p>
</section>
<section id="healthy-traits-stable-but-flexible" class="slide level2">
<h2>Healthy Traits: Stable but Flexible</h2>
<ul>
<li>Healthy personality traits are fairly stable, but they can still flex.</li>
<li>People adjust how they act based on the situation and their goals.</li>
<li>Flexibility helps people solve problems, work with others, and maintain relationships.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Speaker notes:</em><br>
Quick think-pair-share: “Name one trait you see in yourself most of the time. Now, describe a situation where you act differently on purpose.” Use their answers to highlight flexibility as a sign of health.</p>
</section>
<section id="when-do-traits-become-a-problem" class="slide level2">
<h2>When Do Traits Become a Problem?</h2>
<ul>
<li>A strong trait is not a disorder by itself.</li>
<li>A trait becomes a problem when it is extremely intense, very rigid, and hard to control.</li>
<li>The key question is whether the pattern is getting in the way of daily life.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Speaker notes:</em><br>
Say this line clearly: “The issue is not how strong the trait is. The issue is whether it is rigid and causing problems.” This sets up the transition to personality disorders.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-is-a-personality-disorder" class="slide level2">
<h2>What Is a Personality Disorder?</h2>
<ul>
<li>A personality disorder is a long-term pattern of thinking, feeling, and behaving that is inflexible.</li>
<li>This pattern causes serious problems in work, school, or relationships, or strong distress.</li>
<li>The pattern usually begins by adolescence or early adulthood and remains over time.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Speaker notes:</em><br>
This slide is your simplified DSM-style definition. Emphasize “long-term,” “inflexible,” and “causes serious problems.” You can even underline or highlight those words when you teach.</p>
</section>
<section id="three-core-features-of-personality-disorders" class="slide level2">
<h2>Three Core Features of Personality Disorders</h2>
<ul>
<li>The pattern is rigid: the person acts this way across many situations.</li>
<li>The pattern is impairing: it causes real problems or suffering in life.</li>
<li>The pattern is pervasive and long-lasting: it has been present for years, not just during one stressful time.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Speaker notes:</em><br>
Return to these three features often. When a student uses a label like “narcissist,” gently ask: “Is it rigid? Is it impairing? Is it pervasive and long-term?”</p>
</section>
<section id="traits-vs-personality-disorders-simple-summary" class="slide level2">
<h2>Traits vs Personality Disorders: Simple Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>Personality traits: patterns that describe how a person usually tends to be.</li>
<li>Personality disorders: long-term, rigid patterns that cause serious problems.</li>
<li>Traits flex with the situation; personality disorders do not flex much.</li>
<li>Traits can describe people, but only trained professionals diagnose disorders.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Speaker notes:</em><br>
Have students write or say a one-sentence version: “Traits flex; disorders are rigid and impairing.” Encourage them to keep the “only professionals diagnose” idea in mind.</p>
</section>
<section id="example-1-conscientiousness-vs-obsessive-compulsive-personality-disorder" class="slide level2">
<h2>Example 1: Conscientiousness vs Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder</h2>
<ul>
<li>Conscientiousness (trait):
<ul>
<li>Being organized, reliable, and careful with details.</li>
<li>Can help with school, work, and responsibilities.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD):
<ul>
<li>Perfectionism and control that slow down or block tasks.</li>
<li>Difficulty delegating; relationships may suffer due to rigid rules.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Speaker notes:</em><br>
Give concrete contrast:<br>
Student A likes neat notes and plans ahead. Student B rewrites every assignment repeatedly to make it perfect and often misses deadlines. Student B’s pattern is impairing and more rigid, which is what points toward a possible disorder.</p>
</section>
<section id="example-2-extraversion-vs-histrionic-personality-disorder" class="slide level2">
<h2>Example 2: Extraversion vs Histrionic Personality Disorder</h2>
<ul>
<li>Extraversion (trait):
<ul>
<li>Enjoys being around people and social activity.</li>
<li>Feels energized by talking and sharing with others.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Histrionic Personality Disorder:
<ul>
<li>Constant need to be the center of attention.</li>
<li>Very dramatic emotions that make relationships feel shallow or unstable.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Speaker notes:</em><br>
Ask: “Is liking attention a problem by itself?” Answer: No.&nbsp;The issue is when attention-seeking is constant, extreme, and damages relationships. Connect again to impairment and rigidity.</p>
</section>
<section id="example-3-emotional-sensitivity-vs-borderline-personality-disorder" class="slide level2">
<h2>Example 3: Emotional Sensitivity vs Borderline Personality Disorder</h2>
<ul>
<li>Emotional sensitivity (trait):
<ul>
<li>Feels emotions strongly.</li>
<li>May worry or react more, but can still manage feelings most of the time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Borderline Personality Disorder:
<ul>
<li>Very intense and rapidly shifting emotions.</li>
<li>Unstable relationships, fear of abandonment, and risk of self-harm or impulsive actions.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Speaker notes:</em><br>
Normalize emotional sensitivity: many people are “highly sensitive” without having a disorder. Emphasize that Borderline Personality Disorder involves repeated crises, serious risk, and deep impairment, not just “feeling a lot.”</p>
</section>
<section id="why-casual-labels-are-a-problem" class="slide level2">
<h2>Why Casual Labels Are a Problem</h2>
<ul>
<li>People often say “I am so OCD” or “They are such a narcissist” about everyday behavior.</li>
<li>These casual labels are usually inaccurate and can add stigma to real conditions.</li>
<li>Using precise language shows respect for people who live with diagnosed disorders.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Speaker notes:</em><br>
Invite a few examples students have heard (without naming people in the room). Use the three features (rigid, impairing, long-lasting) to show why most casual uses do not match a true disorder.</p>
</section>
<section id="check-your-understanding" class="slide level2">
<h2>Check Your Understanding</h2>
<ul>
<li>How would you explain the difference between a trait and a personality disorder in your own words?</li>
<li>What are the three core features that suggest a personality disorder instead of just a strong trait?</li>
<li>Why is it important not to diagnose friends, family, or yourself based only on a few behaviors?</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Speaker notes:</em><br>
Use this as an exit ticket, quick write, or small-group share. Listen for mentions of rigidity, impairment, and pervasiveness. Correct any answers that blur those lines.</p>
</section>
<section id="key-takeaways" class="slide level2">
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Personality traits are normal differences in how people tend to think, feel, and behave.</li>
<li>Healthy traits are stable but flexible; people can adjust their behavior to fit the situation.</li>
<li>Personality disorders are long-term, rigid patterns that cause serious problems or distress.</li>
<li>Strong traits alone do not equal a disorder; the difference is rigidity, impairment, and how widely the pattern shows up.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Speaker notes:</em><br>
End by returning to the core idea: “Traits flex. Disorders are rigid and impairing.” Connect this lesson to upcoming material on specific disorders and remind them that diagnosis is a careful, professional process.</p>
</section>
<section id="cluster-b-personality-disorders-traits-vs-disorders" class="slide level2">
<h2>Cluster B Personality Disorders: Traits vs Disorders</h2>
<ul>
<li>This lesson focuses on cluster B personality disorders.</li>
<li>We will look at how normal traits connect to these disorders.</li>
<li>We will practice telling strong traits apart from personality disorders.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Speaker notes:</em><br>
Cluster B includes antisocial, borderline, histrionic, and narcissistic personality disorders. These are often described as dramatic, highly emotional, or erratic in style. Emphasize that we are not here to diagnose anyone in the room; we are learning how psychologists think about traits and disorders.</p>
</section>
<section id="quick-review-traits-vs-personality-disorders" class="slide level2">
<h2>Quick Review: Traits vs Personality Disorders</h2>
<ul>
<li>Personality traits are normal differences in how people tend to think, feel, and behave.</li>
<li>Healthy traits are fairly stable, but they can still flex with the situation.</li>
<li>A personality disorder is a long-term, rigid pattern that causes serious problems in life.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Speaker notes:</em><br>
Brief recap from the previous lesson. If needed, ask a student to give a one-sentence difference between a trait and a disorder. Aim to hear words like “rigid” and “impairing.”</p>
</section>
<section id="what-is-cluster-b" class="slide level2">
<h2>What Is Cluster B?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cluster B personality disorders share a dramatic, emotional, or erratic style.</li>
<li>People may struggle with impulse control and unstable relationships.</li>
<li>Cluster B includes:
<ul>
<li>Antisocial Personality Disorder</li>
<li>Borderline Personality Disorder</li>
<li>Histrionic Personality Disorder</li>
<li>Narcissistic Personality Disorder</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Speaker notes:</em><br>
Stress that “dramatic” and “emotional” are not insults. They describe an overall style. The key question is whether patterns are long-term, inflexible, and impairing.</p>
</section>
<section id="cluster-b-traits-that-sit-nearby" class="slide level2">
<h2>Cluster B: Traits That Sit Nearby</h2>
<ul>
<li>Normal traits that sit near cluster B disorders include:
<ul>
<li>Boldness and risk-taking</li>
<li>Emotional intensity and sensitivity</li>
<li>Lively, expressive, or dramatic social style</li>
<li>Strong need for approval or recognition</li>
</ul></li>
<li>These traits can be strengths when they are flexible and well managed.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Speaker notes:</em><br>
Have students brainstorm positive versions of each: boldness as leadership, emotional intensity as empathy, drama as performance skills, desire for approval as motivation to do well.</p>
</section>
<section id="when-nearby-traits-become-disorders" class="slide level2">
<h2>When Nearby Traits Become Disorders</h2>
<ul>
<li>Traits become a personality disorder when:
<ul>
<li>The pattern is rigid and shows up across many situations.</li>
<li>The pattern causes serious distress or repeated life problems.</li>
<li>The pattern has been present for years, not just during one crisis.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cluster B disorders often involve trouble with emotional control, impulses, and relationships.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Speaker notes:</em><br>
Anchor again: rigidity, impairment, and long-term presence. These three features are your guardrails for the rest of the lecture.</p>
</section>
<section id="antisocial-style-normal-trait-range" class="slide level2">
<h2>Antisocial Style: Normal Trait Range</h2>
<ul>
<li>Some people are more daring and less anxious than others.</li>
<li>They may enjoy taking risks and breaking small rules for excitement.</li>
<li>In the normal range, they can still:
<ul>
<li>Follow basic laws and rules.</li>
<li>Care about not harming others.</li>
<li>Learn from consequences.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Speaker notes:</em><br>
Give examples like legal extreme sports, harmless pranks, or entrepreneurs who tolerate financial risk. These may be bold or rule-bending, but they still respect others’ rights and the law.</p>
</section>
<section id="antisocial-personality-disorder" class="slide level2">
<h2>Antisocial Personality Disorder</h2>
<ul>
<li>Antisocial Personality Disorder involves:
<ul>
<li>A pattern of ignoring the rights and safety of others.</li>
<li>Repeated lying, cheating, or breaking the law.</li>
<li>Little or no remorse after hurting others.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The pattern begins early in life and continues into adulthood.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Speaker notes:</em><br>
Highlight the moral and legal line: repeated violation of the rights of others, not just being rebellious. Note that many people with this diagnosis have a history of conduct problems in childhood and ongoing legal or work problems as adults. Emphasize impairment and harm to others.</p>
</section>
<section id="antisocial-traits-vs-antisocial-personality-disorder" class="slide level2">
<h2>Antisocial Traits vs Antisocial Personality Disorder</h2>
<ul>
<li>Strong risk-taking or rule-testing is not enough for a diagnosis.</li>
<li>Antisocial Personality Disorder requires:
<ul>
<li>Long-term, pervasive disregard for others.</li>
<li>Serious behavior problems, often including crime or aggression.</li>
<li>A pattern of not caring about the damage done.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Only trained professionals can diagnose this disorder.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Speaker notes:</em><br>
Ask: “Can someone be rebellious or thrill-seeking without having Antisocial Personality Disorder?” Make sure students can answer yes and name what is missing: the chronic, harmful disregard for others.</p>
</section>
<section id="borderline-style-normal-trait-range" class="slide level2">
<h2>Borderline Style: Normal Trait Range</h2>
<ul>
<li>Some people are naturally emotionally sensitive.</li>
<li>They may feel highs and lows more intensely than those around them.</li>
<li>In the normal range, they can:
<ul>
<li>Calm down with time or support.</li>
<li>Maintain stable relationships overall.</li>
<li>Keep impulses in check most of the time.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Speaker notes:</em><br>
Normalize emotional sensitivity. Many students will recognize themselves here. Emotional intensity alone is not a disorder.</p>
</section>
<section id="borderline-personality-disorder" class="slide level2">
<h2>Borderline Personality Disorder</h2>
<ul>
<li>Borderline Personality Disorder involves:
<ul>
<li>Strong and rapidly shifting emotions.</li>
<li>Unstable or intense relationships and fear of abandonment.</li>
<li>An unstable sense of self and frequent impulsive behaviors.</li>
<li>Risk of self-harm or suicidal behavior.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The pattern creates serious distress and relationship chaos.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Speaker notes:</em><br>
Be matter-of-fact but clear about the risk of self-harm and suicide. Emphasize compassion. People with Borderline Personality Disorder are often highly distressed and not simply “being dramatic.”</p>
</section>
<section id="emotional-sensitivity-vs-borderline-personality-disorder" class="slide level2">
<h2>Emotional Sensitivity vs Borderline Personality Disorder</h2>
<ul>
<li>Emotional sensitivity means feeling things strongly, but still being able to cope most of the time.</li>
<li>Borderline Personality Disorder means:
<ul>
<li>Frequent emotional storms that are hard to calm.</li>
<li>Repeated relationship crises and frantic efforts to avoid being left.</li>
<li>Impulsive acts that create serious harm.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The difference is the level of instability and impairment.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Speaker notes:</em><br>
Ask students: “What signs tell you this is more than just a ‘big feelings’ person?” Look for answers about repeated crises, self-harm, and very unstable relationships.</p>
</section>
<section id="histrionic-style-normal-trait-range" class="slide level2">
<h2>Histrionic Style: Normal Trait Range</h2>
<ul>
<li>Some people are naturally lively, expressive, and love being the center of attention.</li>
<li>They may enjoy performing, telling stories, or dressing in bold ways.</li>
<li>In the normal range, they can:
<ul>
<li>Turn the spotlight off when needed.</li>
<li>Respect social and professional boundaries.</li>
<li>Maintain stable friendships and work roles.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Speaker notes:</em><br>
Use entertainers as a neutral example of high expressiveness. Attention-seeking in itself is not a disorder; context and control matter.</p>
</section>
<section id="histrionic-personality-disorder" class="slide level2">
<h2>Histrionic Personality Disorder</h2>
<ul>
<li>Histrionic Personality Disorder involves:
<ul>
<li>Constant need to be the center of attention.</li>
<li>Very dramatic or rapidly shifting emotions.</li>
<li>Behavior that may be overly sexual or inappropriate for the situation.</li>
<li>Relationships that feel shallow or only surface-deep.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Speaker notes:</em><br>
Emphasize that people with this disorder may not see their behavior as a problem. The impairment often shows up in repeated work issues and unstable relationships.</p>
</section>
<section id="expressive-traits-vs-histrionic-personality-disorder" class="slide level2">
<h2>Expressive Traits vs Histrionic Personality Disorder</h2>
<ul>
<li>Being outgoing and dramatic can be a strength in many settings.</li>
<li>Histrionic Personality Disorder means:
<ul>
<li>Attention-seeking is constant and intense.</li>
<li>Emotional displays are out of proportion to the situation.</li>
<li>Relationships suffer because others feel used or overwhelmed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The problem is not “liking attention”; it is the rigid, costly pattern.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Speaker notes:</em><br>
Have students generate two examples: one of a healthy expressive person and one of a pattern that would fit a disorder. Help them notice the role of context and consequences.</p>
</section>
<section id="narcissistic-style-normal-trait-range" class="slide level2">
<h2>Narcissistic Style: Normal Trait Range</h2>
<ul>
<li>Some people are very confident and ambitious.</li>
<li>They may enjoy leadership, achievement, and recognition.</li>
<li>In the normal range, they can:
<ul>
<li>Take feedback and adjust when needed.</li>
<li>Recognize others’ needs and contributions.</li>
<li>Form real, mutual relationships.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Speaker notes:</em><br>
This is a good place to point out that confidence and pride in achievements can be healthy and motivating.</p>
</section>
<section id="narcissistic-personality-disorder" class="slide level2">
<h2>Narcissistic Personality Disorder</h2>
<ul>
<li>Narcissistic Personality Disorder involves:
<ul>
<li>A grandiose sense of self-importance.</li>
<li>A strong need for admiration and praise.</li>
<li>A lack of empathy for other people’s feelings or needs.</li>
<li>A pattern of entitlement and using others for personal gain.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Speaker notes:</em><br>
Stress that this is more than “being a little full of yourself.” It is a long-standing pattern across many situations, and it often leads to work problems and relationship breakdowns.</p>
</section>
<section id="confidence-vs-narcissistic-personality-disorder" class="slide level2">
<h2>Confidence vs Narcissistic Personality Disorder</h2>
<ul>
<li>Healthy confidence means valuing yourself while still caring about others.</li>
<li>Narcissistic Personality Disorder means:
<ul>
<li>Believing you are superior and deserve special treatment.</li>
<li>Becoming angry or hurt when not praised or admired.</li>
<li>Ignoring or dismissing other people’s needs and feelings.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The key issues are entitlement, lack of empathy, and harm to relationships.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Speaker notes:</em><br>
Ask: “How is a confident person different from someone with Narcissistic Personality Disorder?” Look for: ability to accept criticism, empathy, and real mutual relationships.</p>

<section id="common-threads-across-cluster-b" class="slide level2">
<h2>Common Threads Across Cluster B</h2>
<ul>
<li>Normal traits near cluster B can include:
<ul>
<li>Boldness and risk-taking.</li>
<li>Emotional intensity.</li>
<li>Expressiveness and desire for attention.</li>
<li>Ambition and confidence.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In disorders, these traits become:
<ul>
<li>Rigid, extreme, and hard to control.</li>
<li>Damaging to work, school, and relationships.</li>
<li>Sources of distress and sometimes danger.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Speaker notes:</em><br>
Summarize: Cluster B is not about having big feelings or big personalities. It is about patterns that are intense, rigid, and impairing across many parts of life.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-you-should-not-diagnose-people-around-you" class="slide level2">
<h2>Why You Should Not Diagnose People Around You</h2>
<ul>
<li>Many people show bits and pieces of these traits at times.</li>
<li>Only trained professionals can diagnose personality disorders.</li>
<li>Mislabeling others as “narcissistic,” “borderline,” or “antisocial” can be:
<ul>
<li>Inaccurate</li>
<li>Stigmatizing</li>
<li>Harmful to real help-seeking</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Speaker notes:</em><br>
Reinforce humility. Encourage students to use this knowledge to understand patterns, not to attack or pathologize people in their lives. If time allows, discuss why people might casually use these labels and what the risks are.</p>
</section>
<section id="check-your-understanding-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Check Your Understanding</h2>
<ul>
<li>How can you tell the difference between a normal trait and a personality disorder?</li>
<li>What makes antisocial, borderline, histrionic, and narcissistic patterns part of the same cluster?</li>
<li>Why is flexibility such an important idea in deciding whether a trait has become a disorder?</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Speaker notes:</em><br>
Use these as quick-write prompts or a short quiz. Listen for understanding of the trait–disorder boundary, the dramatic and emotional style of cluster B, and the role of flexibility versus rigidity.</p>
</section>
<section id="key-takeaways-1" class="slide level2">
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cluster B personality disorders share a dramatic, emotional, or erratic style.</li>
<li>Each disorder has nearby traits that can be normal and even helpful in the right context.</li>
<li>The shift from trait to disorder happens when patterns are rigid, long-term, and seriously impairing.</li>
<li>Understanding these differences can reduce stigma and improve how we talk about mental health.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Speaker notes:</em><br>
End by returning to the core teaching idea: traits can be strong and still healthy; disorders are strong, rigid, and costly across many parts of life. Connect forward to upcoming units on other psychological disorders and treatment.</p>
