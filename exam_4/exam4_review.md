# Chapter 12 · Personality – Study Guide

Use this section to understand what personality is, how major theories explain it, and how traits and situations interact.

## What Personality Is (and Is Not)

- **Personality** is a **relatively stable pattern** in how you think, feel, and behave over time and across situations.
- It is different from:
  - **Mood**: short-term emotional states (for example, “I’m in a bad mood today”).
  - **Reflexes or one-time reactions**: quick responses that do not reflect your usual pattern.
- When you think about personality, think “long-term tendencies,” not one bad day.

## Humanistic View – Rogers and Growth

- **Humanistic theories** focus on personal growth, self-acceptance, and living authentically.
- **Fully functioning person (Rogers)**:
  - Shows **congruence**: their self-concept matches their actual experience.
  - Is open to new experiences and willing to grow.
- **Unconditional positive regard**:
  - Being valued as a person **without conditions** (“I care about you even when you make mistakes”).
  - Supports **self-acceptance** and healthier development.
- **Conditional regard** (“I only value you if you succeed”) can create anxiety and self-criticism.

## Trait Views – Big Five and Beyond

- **Trait theories** describe personality in terms of basic dimensions.
- **Big Five (OCEAN)**:
  - **Openness** (curious vs conventional)
  - **Conscientiousness** (organized vs careless)
  - **Extraversion** (outgoing vs reserved)
  - **Agreeableness** (kind vs suspicious)
  - **Neuroticism** (emotionally reactive vs calm)
- Traits are **continuous**: most people are somewhere in the middle, not all-or-nothing.
- **Agreeableness** in particular:
  - Tendency to be **kind, trusting, and cooperative**.
  - Useful when thinking about how people handle conflict and relationships.
- Newer models like **HEXACO** add **Honesty–Humility**, which covers sincerity, fairness, and lack of greed.

## Social-Cognitive View – Beliefs and Environments

- **Social-cognitive theories** emphasize:
  - How you think about yourself and the world.
  - How you learn from experience.
- **Locus of control**:
  - **Internal**: “My actions influence outcomes.”
  - **External**: “Things mostly happen because of luck, fate, or powerful others.”
  - Your locus of control affects motivation and persistence.
- **Reciprocal determinism** (Bandura):
  - Your **behavior**, **personal factors** (beliefs, emotions), and **environment** all influence each other.
  - Example: being shy (personal factor) → avoiding parties (behavior) → having fewer social opportunities (environment) → reinforcing shyness.

## Person–Situation Interaction

- Trait theories and social-cognitive views come together in the **person–situation interaction** idea:
  - Traits influence how you usually respond.
  - Situations can pull out different sides of you.
- It is not “all traits” or “all situations.” Behavior is shaped by **both**.
- Example:
  - A generally conscientious person may still miss assignments during a major crisis.
  - A generally shy person might participate more in a small, supportive group.

## Traits vs Symptoms

- **Personality traits**:
  - Long-term tendencies (for example, being generally organized or generally anxious).
- **Disorder symptoms**:
  - Specific patterns tied to psychological disorders (for example, panic attacks, hallucinations, episodes of deep depression).
- A person can have:
  - High conscientiousness (trait) without depression.
  - Depressive symptoms without a particular trait profile.
- Study clue: ask “Is this a long-term style, or a pattern tied to a disorder episode?”

## Psychodynamic View – Defense Mechanisms

- **Psychodynamic theories** emphasize unconscious processes and conflict.
- **Defense mechanisms** are automatic strategies to reduce anxiety or protect self-esteem, such as:
  - **Repression** (blocking painful memories)
  - **Projection** (seeing your own impulses in others)
  - **Rationalization** (making excuses to protect your self-image)
- Short-term, these can help you cope; long-term, overuse can block honest self-understanding and growth.


# Chapter 14 · Psychological Disorders – Study Guide

Use this section to understand how psychologists define disorders, what the DSM-5 is for, and how to distinguish major categories.

## What Counts as a Psychological Disorder?

- A **psychological disorder** is a **pattern** of thoughts, feelings, or behaviors that:
  - Causes **significant distress**, and/or
  - **Interferes** with daily life (school, work, relationships, self-care).
- It is not enough that behavior is unusual or odd; psychologists look at:
  - **How intense** the problem is.
  - **How long** it lasts.
  - **How much** it interferes with daily functioning.

## Lenses for Understanding “Abnormal”

- Psychologists use several **lenses** at once:
  - **Statistical unusualness**: How rare is the pattern?
  - **Subjective discomfort**: How much distress does the person report?
  - **Social nonconformity**: Does it strongly violate norms?
  - **Maladaptiveness**: Does it seriously interfere with living?
- Key idea: **maladaptiveness** and **interference with life** are central.
- Being different or nonconforming is not automatically a disorder.

## DSM-5 and Diagnosis

- The **DSM-5** is a manual that:
  - Lists recognized mental disorders.
  - Provides criteria (which symptoms, how many, how long, with what impact).
- Purpose:
  - Gives a **shared language** for clinicians and researchers.
  - Guides **assessment and treatment planning**.
- DSM-5 does **not**:
  - Tell you exactly how to treat every case.
  - Tell you whether a person is “good” or “bad.”

## Comorbidity

- **Comorbidity** means having **two or more disorders at the same time**.
  - Example: depression and anxiety in the same person.
- Many real people have overlapping conditions, not just one clean diagnosis.
- This complicates treatment and research but reflects real life.

## Stress–Vulnerability (Diathesis–Stress) Model

- **Vulnerability (diathesis)**:
  - Genetic, biological, and early-experience factors that increase risk.
- **Stress**:
  - Life events, trauma, ongoing conflict, poverty, discrimination, and other pressures.
- The model says:
  - Disorders often appear when **vulnerability** and **stress** combine.
  - Lowering stress and increasing support can help even when vulnerability is high.

## Anxiety vs Depressive Disorders

- **Anxiety disorders**:
  - Have **excessive, persistent fear or worry**.
  - Examples: GAD, panic disorder, specific phobia.
- **Depressive disorders**:
  - Have **sustained low mood or loss of interest**, plus other symptoms.
  - Example: major depressive disorder.
- Depression and anxiety often co-occur but are **classified separately**.

## Schizophrenia – Positive and Negative Symptoms

- **Schizophrenia** is a psychotic disorder with:
  - **Positive symptoms** (added experiences):
    - Hallucinations (perceptions without external input).
    - Delusions (strongly held false beliefs).
  - **Negative symptoms** (losses or reductions):
    - Flat affect (reduced emotional expression).
    - Very little speech (alogia).
    - Reduced motivation and social engagement.
- Knowing the difference helps you understand the variety of experiences within the same diagnosis.

## Personality Disorders

- **Personality disorders** are:
  - Long-standing, inflexible patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving.
  - Patterns that **deviate from cultural expectations** and cause problems.
- They differ from:
  - Normal personality variation (e.g., being shy or bold).
  - Short-term mood shifts.


# Chapter 15 · Psychological Therapies – Study Guide

Use this section to keep straight what psychotherapy is, how approaches differ, and how medical treatments fit in.

## What Psychotherapy Is For

- **Psychotherapy** is a **psychological treatment** that:
  - Uses conversation, practice, and psychological techniques.
  - Aims to change **thoughts, feelings, and behaviors**.
  - Reduces distress and improves functioning.
- It is different from:
  - Casual advice from friends.
  - Purely medical procedures or medications.

## Psychodynamic Therapy

- Focus:
  - **Unconscious conflicts** and early experiences.
- Common methods:
  - **Free association**: say whatever comes to mind.
  - **Dream interpretation**: look for themes and symbols.
- Goal:
  - Insight into hidden patterns that might be driving current problems.

## Client-Centered (Person-Centered) Therapy

- Developed by **Carl Rogers**.
- Style:
  - **Nondirective**: the therapist does not take over or give lots of advice.
- Core conditions:
  - **Empathy**: understanding the client’s inner world.
  - **Genuineness**: being real, not fake or distant.
  - **Unconditional positive regard**:
    - Accepting the person even when you do not approve of all behaviors.
    - Helps clients move toward self-acceptance and growth.

## Behavior Therapies – Exposure

- Focus on **observable behavior**.
- **Exposure therapy**:
  - Helps people face feared situations or objects instead of avoiding them.
  - Anxiety usually **spikes at first** and then **gradually decreases** if the person stays in the situation.
- Avoidance keeps fear alive; exposure allows the nervous system to learn “I can handle this.”

## Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)

- CBT works on **both thoughts and behaviors**.
- Typical CBT steps:
  - Identify **automatic thoughts** (“I’m a total failure”).
  - Recognize **cognitive distortions** (all-or-nothing thinking, catastrophizing).
  - Challenge and replace them with more balanced thoughts.
  - Add **behavioral actions** (practice skills, gradually face feared situations, increase healthy activities).
- CBT is:
  - More **structured and time-limited** than many other therapies.
  - Widely used for depression, anxiety, and more.

## Biomedical Treatments

- **Biomedical therapies** use medications and medical procedures.
- Examples:
  - **Antidepressants** for depression and some anxiety disorders.
  - **Antipsychotics** for psychotic disorders like schizophrenia.
  - **Mood stabilizers** for bipolar disorders.
- Medications aim at **brain chemistry**, while psychotherapy aims at **thoughts, feelings, behavior, and relationships**.
- Often, **combined treatment** (meds + therapy) works best.

## Therapeutic Alliance and Help-Seeking

- **Therapeutic alliance**:
  - The quality of the working relationship between client and therapist.
  - Includes trust, collaboration, and agreement on goals.
  - Strong alliance is linked to better outcomes across many therapy types.
- **Help-seeking**:
  - Consider talking to a professional if:
    - Problems with sleep, appetite, mood, or functioning are **persistent** and **disruptive**.
    - Self-help strategies have not been enough.
  - Reaching out earlier can make problems easier to treat.

## Group Therapy Basics

- **Group therapy**:
  - Several clients meet together with one or more therapists.
  - Benefits:
    - Realizing “I am not the only one” (**universality**).
    - Getting **feedback and support** from peers.
    - Practicing new skills in a social setting.
  - Trade-offs:
    - Less privacy than one-on-one therapy.
    - Different group dynamics to manage.


# Chapter 17 · Social Psychology – Study Guide

Use this section to understand how and why people connect, help, conform, and sometimes harm or exclude others.

## Need to Affiliate and Belong

- Humans have a basic **need to affiliate**:
  - We seek connections to reduce anxiety, feel supported, and be part of a group.
- **Social comparison**:
  - We judge our abilities and opinions by comparing ourselves with others.
  - This can help us feel “normal” or motivate us to change.

## Prosocial Behavior

- **Prosocial behavior**:
  - Actions intended to **benefit others** (helping, sharing, comforting).
- Key idea: focus on **intention to help**, not just outcome.
- Motives can be:
  - **Egoistic** (to feel good, avoid guilt, look good).
  - **Altruistic** (out of concern for others, without expecting reward).
- **Empathy** often encourages altruistic helping.

## Bystander Effect and Responsibility

- **Bystander effect**:
  - People are **less likely to help** when more bystanders are present.
- **Diffusion of responsibility**:
  - Each person assumes someone else will step in.
- Helping usually requires:
  - Noticing the situation.
  - Interpreting it as an emergency or needing help.
  - Feeling responsible.
  - Knowing what to do.
  - Deciding to act.
- Anything that disrupts these steps can block helping.

## Prejudice vs Discrimination

- **Prejudice**:
  - Negative **attitude or feeling** toward a group.
- **Discrimination**:
  - Negative **behavior** toward group members.
- It is useful to separate:
  - What people **believe** (stereotypes).
  - How they **feel** (prejudice).
  - How they **act** (discrimination).
- The **Jane Elliott exercise** (blue-eyes/brown-eyes) is a classic example used to highlight how attitudes and behaviors can change in a short time when group statuses shift.

## Attraction – Proximity

- **Proximity** (physical closeness) increases the chance of forming relationships.
  - More contact → more familiarity → greater liking (usually).
- It partly explains why:
  - Friends and partners often come from the same school, workplace, or neighborhood.

## Conformity

- **Conformity**:
  - Adjusting behavior or beliefs to match group norms or expectations.
- It is different from:
  - **Obedience**: following direct orders from an authority.
  - **Prosocial behavior**: helping.
  - **Prejudice/discrimination**: bias and unfair treatment.
- Conformity can:
  - Reduce conflict and help groups function.
  - Also support harmful norms if the group is doing something wrong.

Use this guide to **organize your understanding** of each chapter. When you study:

- Try to **explain each main concept in your own words**.
- Think of **real-life examples** for each idea.
- Notice how concepts from different chapters **connect** (for example, how stress–vulnerability in Chapter 14 connects to seeking therapy in Chapter 15, or how traits in Chapter 12 relate to prosocial behavior in Chapter 17).
