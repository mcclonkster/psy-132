        "### What We Are Studying\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Not every life problem is a disorder.\n",
        "-   We focus on patterns of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that are:\n",
        "    -   Very **intense** or **extreme**.\n",

        "    -   A pattern of thoughts, feelings, or behaviors that causes\n",

        "\n",
        "### How Much Pain and Interference?\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Ask how much **emotional pain** the person reports.\n",
        "-   Ask how much the pattern **gets in the way** of:\n",

        "    -   Basic self-care and daily tasks.\n",
        "-   Little pain and little interference usually suggests no disorder.\n",

        "-   **Subjective discomfort**: the person feels ongoing emotional\n",

        "-   Use short examples:\n",
        "    -   Discomfort: constant, overwhelming anxiety or sadness that feels\n",
        "        unbearable.\n",

        "        hygiene because of low mood.\n",
