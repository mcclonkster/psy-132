## 14.1 Psychopathology: Classification and Causes

**Psychopathology** is the study of mental, behavioral, and emotional disorders.

### Four things to consider when deciding whether behavior is abnormal

The textbook identifies four key ideas to think about when deciding if behavior is abnormal:

1. **Statistical abnormality**
   - Behavior is rare or falls far from the average.
   - Example: very extreme scores on a depression scale compared to most people.

2. **Nonconformity (social nonconformity)**
   - Behavior seriously violates social norms or expectations.
   - Example: acting in ways that are grossly inappropriate for the situation, such as shouting at strangers in a quiet library.

3. **Subjective discomfort**
   - The person feels intense, ongoing emotional pain or distress about their own thoughts or behavior.
   - Example: someone feels tormented by constant, unwanted intrusive thoughts.

4. **Maladaptive behavior**
   - The behavior seriously interferes with a person’s ability to function (work, school, relationships, self-care).
   - Example: someone who stops going to work, cannot maintain hygiene, or cannot manage daily tasks because of their symptoms.

**Key points:**

- These four ideas are guides, not strict rules.
- A psychological disorder usually involves more than one of these, especially subjective discomfort and maladaptive behavior.

### How disorders are classified and diagnosed

- Psychological problems are classified using the **Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)**.
- A **diagnosis** is made by checking which symptoms are present and which are absent, and seeing if they match the **criteria** for a particular disorder.
- People can be **comorbid**, meaning they show symptoms that fit criteria for more than one disorder at the same time.
- DSM categories are revised over time as research and social norms change; categories can be added, changed, or removed.

The DSM describes symptoms in terms of:

- **Positive symptoms** – behaviors or experiences that are more than normal (for example, hallucinations, delusions).
- **Negative symptoms** – losses or deficits compared to normal (for example, flat affect, lack of speech).

### Causes of mental illness and the biopsychosocial model

The chapter emphasizes the **biopsychosocial model**:

- **Biological factors:** genetics, brain structure and chemistry, physical illness.
- **Psychological factors:** learning history, thoughts, coping skills, personality.
- **Social and cultural factors:** relationships, family environment, culture, life stress, trauma, socioeconomic conditions.

The **diathesis–stress** idea fits here: people may have a predisposition (diathesis) that, combined with stress, leads to a disorder.

## 14.2 Psychotic Disorders

Psychotic disorders involve a loss of contact with reality.

- **Delusional disorders**
  - Main feature: strong, false beliefs that are not shared by others and persist despite evidence to the contrary.
  - Example: believing you are being plotted against without any real proof.
- **Schizophrenia**
  - Often involves:
    - Hallucinations (most often hearing voices).
    - Delusions (paranoid or grandiose beliefs).
    - Disorganized thought and speech.
    - Negative symptoms such as reduced emotional expression or lack of motivation.
  - Typically long-term and can be very disabling, but treatment can help many people.

## 14.3 Mood and Personality Disorders

### Mood disorders

Mood disorders involve major disturbances in emotion, such as long-lasting sadness or extreme swings.

- **Depressive disorders**
  - Persistent low mood, loss of interest, changes in sleep and appetite, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness, possible thoughts of death or suicide.
- **Bipolar and related disorders**
  - Shifts between depression and **mania** or **hypomania**:
    - Elevated mood.
    - Increased energy.
    - Decreased need for sleep.
    - Racing thoughts.
    - Impulsive or risky behavior.

### Personality disorders

- Long-standing patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving that:
  - Are inflexible across situations.
  - Cause significant distress or impairment.
- Examples include enduring patterns of:
  - Distrust.
  - Instability in relationships and self-image.
  - Strong need for admiration with lack of empathy.

## 14.4 Anxiety and Anxiety-Related Disorders

### Anxiety disorders

- Feature excessive, unrealistic fear or anxiety that interferes with functioning.

**Examples:**

- **Generalized anxiety disorder:** chronic, widespread worry about many aspects of life.
- **Panic disorder:** repeated panic attacks and persistent concern about having more.
- **Phobias:** intense, irrational fear of specific objects or situations (for example, heights, animals).

### Anxiety-related disorders

These conditions share anxiety features but are classified separately in DSM-5.

**Examples include:**

- **Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD):** recurring unwanted thoughts and repetitive behaviors done to reduce anxiety.
- **Trauma- and stressor-related disorders** such as **PTSD**:
  - Intrusive memories.
  - Nightmares.
  - Avoidance.
  - Hyperarousal following trauma.

---

## 14.5 Psychology and Your Skill Set: Perseverance

This section focuses on **perseverance**, often discussed in terms of “grit”:

- Perseverance means continuing to work toward goals despite obstacles and setbacks.
- The text highlights how sticking with treatment and coping strategies over time is important for recovery.
- Students are encouraged to:
  - Recognize that change can be slow.
  - Practice balancing persistence with self-care.
  - Think about how to apply these ideas to their own challenges.

## 15.1 The Origins and Effectiveness of Psychotherapy

### A brief history of psychotherapy

- Early roots in **psychoanalysis** (Freud): talking about thoughts, dreams, and childhood experiences to uncover unconscious conflicts.
- Later developments include:
  - **Behavior therapies** (influenced by learning theory).
  - **Cognitive therapies** (focused on thought patterns).
  - **Humanistic therapies** (focused on growth and self-acceptance).

### Four characteristics that distinguish psychotherapies

Psychotherapies can be described along these dimensions:

- **Insight-oriented vs action-oriented**
  - Insight-oriented: focus on understanding thoughts and feelings (for example, psychodynamic, humanistic).
  - Action-oriented: focus on changing behaviors and thoughts directly (for example, behavioral, cognitive-behavioral).
- **Directive vs nondirective**
  - Directive: therapist takes an active role in guiding the client, giving advice, or assigning tasks.
  - Nondirective: therapist mainly reflects and supports, letting the client lead.
- **Open-ended vs time-limited**
  - Open-ended: duration is flexible.
  - Time-limited: set number of sessions.
- **Individual vs group; in-person vs remote**
  - Therapy can be one-on-one, in a group, or with couples/families.
  - It can be delivered face-to-face or via phone/Internet.

### Core features of effective psychotherapy

The effectiveness of therapy depends on:

- **Client characteristics**
  - Motivation, expectations, and resources.
- **Therapist characteristics**
  - Warmth, empathy, experience, cultural competence.
- **Therapeutic alliance**
  - The quality of the working relationship and mutual trust between client and therapist.
- **Nature of the problem**
  - Some problems respond better to certain approaches than others.

Overall, research shows that psychotherapy is often more helpful than no treatment at all across many problems.

## 15.2 Behavior Therapies

Behavior therapies focus on **changing maladaptive behavior**, often using principles of conditioning.

### Main elements of behavior therapies

- Behavior therapists apply **classical** and **operant conditioning** to directly change problematic behaviors and thoughts.
- They emphasize behavior change and skill-building more than deep “insight.”

### Therapies based on classical conditioning

- **Aversion therapy**
  - Pairs an unwanted behavior (for example, heavy drinking) with something unpleasant to reduce that behavior.
- **Exposure therapies**
  - Help people face feared situations or cues safely, to reduce anxiety over time.
  - Types include:
    - **Flooding:** facing the fear all at once.
    - **Systematic desensitization:** gradual exposure paired with relaxation.
    - **Modeling:** observing others confronting fears.

These techniques aim to weaken learned fear responses.

### Therapies based on operant conditioning

- Use **reinforcement** and other consequences to reduce undesired behaviors and increase desired ones.

**Tools include:**

- Positive reinforcement: rewarding desirable behaviors.
- Non-reinforcement and extinction: removing rewards to reduce unwanted behaviors.
- Punishment: adding unpleasant consequences to discourage behavior (used carefully).
- Shaping: reinforcing small steps toward a desired behavior.
- Stimulus control: managing cues that trigger behaviors.
- Time-out: removing access to reinforcement after misbehavior.

**Examples:**

- **Token economies:** people earn tokens for positive behaviors and exchange them for rewards.
- **Intensive behavioral intervention (IBI):** structured behavioral programs, often used with children with autism.

## 15.3 Cognitive and Humanistic Therapies

### Cognitive therapies

Cognitive therapies focus on **distorted thinking** and teach coping skills.

**Key approaches:**

- **Beck’s cognitive therapy**
  - Targets patterns like selective perception (only seeing the negative), overgeneralization, and all-or-nothing thinking.
  - Helps clients identify and change these thought patterns.
- **Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)**
  - Integrates cognitive and behavioral methods.
  - Clients learn to challenge distorted thoughts and test new behaviors.
- **Rational-emotive behavior therapy (REBT)**
  - Trains clients to identify irrational beliefs (“musts,” “shoulds”) and replace them with more realistic, flexible thoughts.

Overall, cognitive therapies aim to modify the thoughts that fuel distress and to build more effective coping.

### Humanistic therapies

Humanistic therapies are **insight-oriented**:

- They help clients gain deeper understanding of their own thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.
- Emphasize personal growth, self-acceptance, and finding meaning.

**Common elements:**

- Seeing the client as basically good and capable of growth.
- Providing warmth, empathy, and genuine respect.
- Letting the client lead the exploration while the therapist offers support and reflection.

## 15.4 Medical Therapies

### Main types of medical therapies

- **Pharmacotherapy (medications)**
  - Use of drugs (for example, antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers) to change brain chemistry and reduce symptoms.
- **Brain stimulation therapies**
  - Methods like electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), used especially for severe depression that has not responded to other treatments.
- **Psychosurgery**
  - Rare surgical procedures on the brain for severe conditions that do not respond to other treatments; much less common now and tightly controlled.

### Hospitalization and community mental health programs

- **Hospitalization**
  - Provides a protected setting for intensive treatment when there is serious risk (for example, suicidal intent, severe psychosis).
- **Community mental health centers**
  - Aim to prevent or reduce the need for hospitalization.
  - Offer services like education, consultation, crisis intervention, and ongoing support in the community.

## 15.5 Psychology and Your Skill Set: Managing Mental Health Issues

This section emphasizes **skills** for dealing with mental health problems in everyday life.

### Key ideas include:

- **Basic counseling skills**
  - Listening carefully, showing empathy, and avoiding judgment when someone shares their struggles.
  - Knowing how to encourage someone to seek professional help when needed.
- **Getting counseling**
  - Understanding that seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness.
  - Knowing steps to find support (talking to a trusted adult, contacting a counseling center, exploring community resources).

**The message:**

- Many psychological problems can be helped.
- You can play a role in supporting others and in getting help for yourself when you need it.
