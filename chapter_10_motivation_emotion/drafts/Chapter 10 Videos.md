### **Chapter 10: Motivation and Emotion**

---

#### **Learning Outcome 10.1.1:** Explain the role played by needs, drives, responses, goals, and incentives in shaping our motives.
* [cite_start]**Summary:** Motives follow a sequence: a **need** (internal deficiency) creates a **drive** (tension state) that activates a **response** toward a **goal**, which is often encouraged by an **incentive** (reward)[cite: 1].
* **Crash Course Psychology:**
    * **["The Power of Motivation: Crash Course Psychology #17"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hdSLiHaJz8)** introduces several theories of motivation, including Drive-Reduction Theory, which directly relates to this objective.
* **Khan Academy:**
    * The MCAT section has a video on **["Theories of motivation"](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/processing-the-environment/emotion-and-motivation/v/theories-of-motivation)** that covers drive-reduction theory and other relevant concepts like needs and incentives.

---

#### **Learning Outcome 10.1.2:** Distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation.
* **Summary:** **Intrinsic motivation** comes from internal factors and is related to competence, autonomy, and relatedness. [cite_start]**Extrinsic motivation** is driven by external factors like money, rewards, or approval[cite: 2].
* **Crash Course Psychology:**
    * **["The Power of Motivation: Crash Course Psychology #17"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hdSLiHaJz8)** also discusses the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation within its broader look at motivational theories.
* **Khan Academy:**
    * Khan Academy has a specific article dedicated to this topic, **["Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation"](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/processing-the-environment/emotion-and-motivation/a/intrinsic-and-extrinsic-motivation)**, which provides a clear explanation.

---

#### **Learning Outcome 10.1.3:** Distinguish between Maslow’s basic needs and growth needs.
* [cite_start]**Summary:** Maslow's hierarchy of needs separates **basic needs** (like survival and belonging) from **growth needs**, which are aimed at fulfilling one's potential (self-actualization)[cite: 3].
* **Crash Course Psychology:**
    * The video on motivation, **["The Power of Motivation: Crash Course Psychology #17"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hdSLiHaJz8)**, covers Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs as a key theory of motivation.
* **Khan Academy:**
    * There is a dedicated video titled **["Maslow's hierarchy of needs"](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/processing-the-environment/emotion-and-motivation/v/maslows-hierarchy-of-needs)** that explains the different levels of the pyramid.

---

#### **Learning Outcome 10.1.4:** Distinguish between biological, stimulus, and learned motives.
* [cite_start]**Summary:** **Biological motives** are for survival, **stimulus motives** are for stimulation (e.g., curiosity), and **learned motives** come from socialization (e.g., the need for achievement or power)[cite: 4].
* **Crash Course Psychology:**
    * While Crash Course doesn't use these exact terms in a single video, **["The Power of Motivation: Crash Course Psychology #17"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hdSLiHaJz8)** covers biological motives (like eating) and touches on learned motives.
* **Khan Academy:**
    * Khan Academy's **["Theories of motivation"](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/processing-the-environment/emotion-and-motivation/v/theories-of-motivation)** video discusses various theories that fall under these different categories (e.g., Drive Reduction Theory for biological motives).

### **Chapter 10.2: Biological Motives**

---

#### **Learning Outcome 10.2.1:** Explain what is meant by the term sex drive, and how hormones are related to the sex drive of human and nonhuman animals.
* **Summary:** The sex drive is a non-homeostatic motivation for sexual behavior. [cite_start]Hormones like estrogen and androgens (e.g., testosterone) play a significant role in influencing this drive in both animals and humans[cite: 1].
* **Crash Course Psychology:**
    * **["Let's Talk About Sex: Crash Course Psychology #27"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-PdHwymbJk)** covers the sexual response cycle, hormones, and the evolutionary perspective on sexual motivation.
* **Khan Academy:**
    * The video on **["Sexual motivation"](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/processing-the-environment/emotion-and-motivation/v/sexual-motivation)** discusses the role of the sex drive and hormones in human behavior.

---

#### **Learning Outcome 10.2.2:** Explain what is meant by the term circadian rhythms, and how these rhythms impact human sleep cycles.
* **Summary:** Circadian rhythms are internal body clock cycles that regulate sleep patterns. [cite_start]Disruptions from travel, shift work, or all-nighters can throw off these rhythms[cite: 2].
* **Crash Course Psychology:**
    * **["To Sleep, Perchance to Dream: Crash Course Psychology #9"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMHus-023aU)** explains the stages of sleep, sleep patterns, and the importance of circadian rhythms.
* **Khan Academy:**
    * There's a dedicated video on **["Sleep and consciousness and circadian rhythms"](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/processing-the-environment/sleep-and-consciousness/v/sleep-and-consciousness-and-circadian-rythms)** that provides a detailed biological explanation.

---

#### **Learning Outcome 10.2.3:** Outline why pain is considered an episodic drive, and how our responses to pain are shaped.
* **Summary:** Pain is an episodic drive, meaning it's triggered by specific instances of bodily damage. [cite_start]Our tolerance and response to pain are influenced by learning, culture, and social factors[cite: 3].
* **Crash Course Psychology:**
    * **["Feeling All the Feels, All the Time: Crash Course Psychology #25"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4-s_OTg-d4)** touches on the perception of pain as part of the broader topic of emotion and the body.
* **Khan Academy:**
    * The video on **["Somatosensation"](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/processing-the-environment/sensory-perception/v/somatosensation)** explains the biological basis of touch, pressure, temperature, and pain.

---

#### **Learning Outcome 10.2.4:** Distinguish between intracellular and extracellular thirst, and how each is best managed.
* **Summary:** **Intracellular thirst** is caused by high salt intake and is best quenched with plain water. [cite_start]**Extracellular thirst** comes from a loss of body fluids and is best managed with drinks containing salts and minerals[cite: 4].
* **Crash Course & Khan Academy:**
    * Neither platform has a specific video detailing the difference between intracellular and extracellular thirst. This concept is typically covered under the broader topic of **homeostasis** and **drive-reduction theory**, which is discussed in the motivation videos linked in the previous section.

---

#### **Learning Outcome 10.2.5:** Outline the internal and external factors that impact hunger.
* **Summary:** Internal hunger cues include body chemistry and brain signals. [cite_start]External cues involve the presence of food, emotions, cultural values, and learned tastes[cite: 5].
* **Crash Course Psychology:**
    * **["The Power of Motivation: Crash Course Psychology #17"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hdSLiHaJz8)** discusses the biology of hunger, including the role of the hypothalamus, and touches on external factors.
* **Khan Academy:**
    * The video **["Theories of motivation"](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/processing-the-environment/emotion-and-motivation/v/theories-of-motivation)** covers biological needs like hunger as a primary motivator.

---

#### **Learning Outcome 10.2.6:** Distinguish between anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, and outline the causes of these eating disorders.
* **Summary:** **Anorexia nervosa** is characterized by severe food restriction, while **bulimia nervosa** involves a cycle of bingeing and purging. [cite_start]Both are often linked to issues with self-image, anxiety, and control[cite: 6].
* **Crash Course Psychology:**
    * **["Trauma & Addiction: Crash Course Psychology #31"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=343ORgL3kIc)** discusses various disorders, and while not solely focused on eating disorders, it provides context on the nature of compulsive behaviors.
* **Khan Academy:**
    * The "Psychological Disorders" section has a dedicated video titled **["Eating disorders"](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/health-and-medicine/mental-health/eating-disorders/v/eating-disorders-anorexia-bulimia-and-binge-eating-disorder)** that clearly explains the differences and potential causes.

### **Chapter 10.3: Stimulus and Learned Motives**

---

#### **Learning Outcome 10.3.1:** Explain the central idea that underlies arousal theory.
* **Summary:** Arousal theory suggests that people are motivated to maintain an ideal, or optimal, level of physical arousal, and this preferred level varies from person to person.
* **Crash Course Psychology:**
    * **["The Power of Motivation: Crash Course Psychology #17"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hdSLiHaJz8)** explains arousal theory as one of the four main theories of motivation.
* **Khan Academy:**
    * The video **["Theories of motivation"](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/processing-the-environment/emotion-and-motivation/v/theories-of-motivation)** covers the Optimum Arousal Theory, explaining the drive to get physiological arousal to an optimal level.

---

#### **Learning Outcome 10.3.2:** Describe the relationship between arousal and performance, as outlined in the Yerkes-Dodson law.
* **Summary:** The Yerkes-Dodson law states that performance is best at a moderate level of arousal. For simple tasks, performance is better at high arousal, but for complex tasks, a lower level of arousal is optimal, creating an inverted-U shaped curve.
* **Crash Course Psychology:**
    * While not a main focus, the relationship between stress/arousal and performance is a recurring theme, particularly in videos on motivation and emotion.
* **Khan Academy:**
    * There is a specific video that explains this concept in detail: **["Yerkes-Dodson Law"](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/processing-the-environment/emotion-and-motivation/v/yerkes-dodson-law)**.

---

#### **Learning Outcome 10.3.3:** Outline what is meant by the need for achievement (nAch) and need for power.
* **Summary:** These are learned social motives that are developed through our culture and socialization and influence how we interact with others. The need for achievement (nAch) drives us to succeed and master skills, while the need for power motivates us to have influence over others.
* **Crash Course & Khan Academy:**
    * Neither platform has a dedicated video specifically for the "need for achievement" or "need for power." These concepts are part of broader motivational theories (like McClelland's Human Motivation Theory) that are generally covered under the main **motivation** videos linked previously.

---

#### **Learning Outcome 10.3.4:** Explain the central idea that underlies opponent-process theory.
* **Summary:** This theory suggests that when we feel a strong emotion, it is followed by an opposite emotional aftereffect once the stimulus is gone. With repetition, the initial strong emotion weakens, and the opposing aftereffect strengthens.
* **Crash Course Psychology:**
    * **["Controversy of Intelligence: Crash Course Psychology #23"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xTz3QjcloI)** briefly mentions opponent-process theory in the context of color vision, but the principle is the same.
* **Khan Academy:**
    * Khan Academy has a video that explains the **["Opponent-process theory"](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/processing-the-environment/emotion-and-motivation/v/opponent-process-theory)** in the context of both emotion and drug addiction.

### **Chapter 10.4: The Four Basic Aspects of Emotion**

---

#### **Learning Outcome 10.4.1:** Outline the four basic aspects of an emotion.
* **Summary:** Emotions are comprised of four components: subjective **experience** (feelings), **physiological** changes, behavioral **expression**, and **cognitive** appraisal.
* **Crash Course Psychology:**
    * **["Feeling All the Feels: Crash Course Psychology #25"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAMbkJk6gnE)** introduces the three elements of an emotion (which it combines as Bodily Arousal, Expressive Behaviors, and Conscious Experience) that align with this objective.
* **Khan Academy:**
    * The video **["Three components of emotion and universal emotions"](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/processing-the-environment/emotion-and-motivation/v/three-components-of-emotion-and-universal-emotions)** provides a clear breakdown of the physiological, behavioral, and cognitive components.

---

#### **Learning Outcome 10.4.2:** Explain what is meant by emotional experience, and how it differs from mood.
* **Summary:** Emotional experience is our subjective, personal feeling state. **Emotions** are generally brief and directed at a specific target or cause, whereas **moods** are longer-lasting and more diffuse.
* **Crash Course & Khan Academy:**
    * While the main emotion videos discuss subjective experience, they don't have a specific segment dedicated to the distinction between emotions and moods. This concept is a foundational part of the broader discussion in the videos linked under 10.4.1.

---

#### **Learning Outcome 10.4.3:** Describe the physiological responses that are associated with emotions.
* **Summary:** The autonomic nervous system manages the body's physiological response to emotion, with the **sympathetic branch** arousing the body and the **parasympathetic branch** calming it. The **amygdala** is key for a rapid, "quick and dirty" fear response.
* **Crash Course Psychology:**
    * **["Feeling All the Feels: Crash Course Psychology #25"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAMbkJk6gnE)** explains the role of the autonomic nervous system in creating the physiological arousal associated with emotion.
* **Khan Academy:**
    * A video on the **["Theories of emotion"](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/processing-the-environment/emotion-and-motivation/v/theories-of-emotion)** explains how physiological changes are central to how we experience emotion. The role of the amygdala is also discussed in the platform's content on brain structures.

---

#### **Learning Outcome 10.4.4:** Outline the various ways in which an emotion can be expressed and regulated.
* **Summary:** Emotions are **expressed** through the face, body language (kinesics), and voice (prosody). They can be **regulated** using strategies like suppression, cognitive reappraisal, and shifting attention.
* **Crash Course Psychology:**
    * The main video on emotion touches on expression, but for regulation, **["Psychological Disorders: Crash Course Psychology #28"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuhJ-GkRRQc)** discusses emotional regulation in the context of mental health.
* **Khan Academy:**
    * The video **["Three components of emotion and universal emotions"](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/processing-the-environment/emotion-and-motivation/v/three-components-of-emotion-and-universal-emotions)** covers the expressive component of emotions.

---

#### **Learning Outcome 10.4.5:** Describe two types of cognition that are relevant to emotions.
* **Summary:** **Attributions**, which are our explanations for why an event occurred, and **appraisals**, which are our evaluations of an event's significance to us, are the key cognitive processes that shape our emotional responses.
* **Crash Course Psychology:**
    * **["Feeling All the Feels: Crash Course Psychology #25"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAMbkJk6gnE)** explains the Schachter-Singer Two-Factor theory, which emphasizes the critical role of cognitive appraisal in labeling our emotions.
* **Khan Academy:**
    * The **["Theories of emotion"](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/processing-the-environment/emotion-and-motivation/v/theories-of-emotion)** video also covers the Schachter-Singer theory, highlighting how cognition shapes our emotional experience.

### **Chapter 10.5: Connecting the Four Aspects of Emotion**

---

#### **Learning Outcome 10.5.1:** Outline the similarities and differences between the James-Lange, Cannon-Bard, and Schachter-Singer theories of emotion.
* **Summary:** **James-Lange** = bodily reaction causes the feeling. **Cannon-Bard** = bodily reaction and feeling happen simultaneously. **Schachter-Singer** = bodily arousal plus a cognitive label creates the emotion. The first two theories omit the cognitive component.
* **Crash Course Psychology:**
    * **["Feeling All the Feels: Crash Course Psychology #25"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAMbkJk6gnE)** provides an excellent and clear comparison of these three core theories of emotion.
* **Khan Academy:**
    * There is a dedicated video that explains all three: **["Theories of emotion"](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/processing-the-environment/emotion-and-motivation/v/theories-of-emotion)**.

---

#### **Learning Outcome 10.5.2:** Explain the central idea that underlies basic emotion theories (BETs), and the strengths and weaknesses of Ekman’s BET.
* **Summary:** Basic Emotion Theories (BETs) propose that there are a few distinct, universal emotions. Paul Ekman's influential theory identified six such emotions (surprise, happiness, sadness, anger, disgust, fear) that are fast, universal, and shared with other mammals. Criticisms include the limitations of relying only on facial cues and not fully accounting for cultural differences.
* **Crash Course Psychology:**
    * **["Feeling All the Feels: Crash Course Psychology #25"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAMbkJk6gnE)** discusses the idea of universal emotions and references Paul Ekman's work.
* **Khan Academy:**
    * The video on the **["Three components of emotion and universal emotions"](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/processing-the-environment/emotion-and-motivation/v/three-components-of-emotion-and-universal-emotions)** covers Ekman's theory of seven universal emotions.

---

### **Chapter 10.6: Psychology and Your Skill Set: Positivity and Optimism**

---

#### **Learning Outcome 10.6.1:** Outline what is meant by the terms positive psychology, subjective well-being, and optimism.
* **Summary:** **Positive Psychology** is the study of positive emotions, human strengths, and well-being. **Optimism** is a mindset that aids in coping and growth.
* **Crash Course Psychology:**
    * **["Positive Psychology: Crash Course Psychology #24"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qJvS8v0TTI)** is dedicated to this topic, explaining the history and focus of the field, including concepts like "flow" and happiness.
* **Khan Academy:**
    * While there isn't a dedicated "Positive Psychology" section, concepts related to well-being and coping are covered in the **["Stress and coping"](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/processing-the-environment/stress/v/stress-and-coping)** video.

---

#### **Learning Outcome 10.6.2:** Outline the three elements of explanatory style.
* **Summary:** Explanatory style is how we explain events to ourselves. It involves three elements: **pervasiveness** (how much of life an event impacts), **permanence** (how long it will last), and **personalization** (whether it's due to internal traits or external circumstances).
* **Crash Course & Khan Academy:**
    * This specific concept, a key part of positive psychology, is not explicitly detailed in its own video. However, it is a core component of the theories discussed in the **["Positive Psychology: Crash Course Psychology #24"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qJvS8v0TTI)** video.

---

#### **Learning Outcome 10.6.3:** Create a plan that will allow you to be more positive and optimistic about an issue that you find challenging.
* **Summary:** This is a personal application objective. The goal is to build a more optimistic explanatory style by consciously reframing challenges in terms of their pervasiveness, permanence, and personalization to improve resilience and daily life.
* **Crash Course Psychology:**
    * The **["Positive Psychology: Crash Course Psychology #24"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qJvS8v0TTI)** video provides the foundational concepts (like learned optimism) that would be used to create such a plan.
* **Khan Academy:**
    * The video on **["Stress and coping"](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/processing-the-environment/stress/v/stress-and-coping)** offers strategies for managing challenges, which is a key part of building optimism.
