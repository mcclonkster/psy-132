# Motivation  
_PS Y 132 — One-Class Overview_

Today we will:  
- Replace “motivation = willpower” with a usable model  
- Distinguish **drives** from **incentives**  
- Survey motive types (biological, stimulus, social/learned)  
- See how goals and feedback shape persistence  
- Apply the model to everyday choices

<!--
Presenter notes:
- Set the tone: this is about understanding causes, not “trying harder.”
- Mention that we’ll use real examples from the room; no writing is required.
- Invite one quick voice: “In one sentence, what got you here today?”
- Estimated: 2 min
-->

## Agenda

1. What motivation means  
2. Core chain: **Need → Drive → Response → Goal**  
3. Push vs pull: drives and incentives  
4. Motive types: biological, stimulus, social  
5. Goals, expectancy–value, and plans  
6. Rewards, feedback, and persistence  
7. Putting it together: quick cases  
8. Common misconceptions and check-for-understanding

<!--
Notes:
- Reassure students we’ll emphasize understanding over memorizing.
- Headline the “why”: this helps explain daily behavior and habit change.
- Estimated: 1 min
-->

## What motivation is (and isn’t)

**Motivation** is the set of processes that **energize**, **direct**, and **sustain** behavior.  
It is not just “wanting it more.”

- Energize: start behavior  
- Direct: choose among behaviors  
- Sustain: keep behavior going (or stop it)

<!--
Notes:
- Use a concrete example: “Studying after work” — energized by deadline, directed by exam goal, sustained by coffee/study buddy.
- Ask: “Who has a different example where starting vs staying were different problems?”
- Estimated: 3 min
-->

---

## Core chain to explain actions

**Need → Drive → Response → Goal**

- **Need:** a deficit or desired state (calories, sleep, belonging, competence)  
- **Drive:** internal tension that pushes action (hunger, fatigue, curiosity)  
- **Response:** what you do (eat, nap, open notes, text a friend)  
- **Goal:** outcome that reduces need or satisfies value (satiety, rest, progress, connection)

<!--
Notes:
- Draw this on the board as four boxes with arrows.
- Map one student’s example onto it (e.g., hunger today → drive → get food → feel okay).
- Reiterate: the chain is descriptive, not moral.
- Estimated: 3 min
-->

---

## Push vs pull

- **Drives (push):** internal states pressuring action  
- **Incentives (pull):** external outcomes attracting action

Most behaviors mix both.

Examples:  
- Tired but attend class for quiz: drive (fatigue) + incentive (points)  
- Not tired but attend for belonging: incentive dominates

<!--
Notes:
- Ask for two live examples and classify together.
- If confusion persists, restate: pushes arise from the body/needs; pulls arise from cues/outcomes.
- Estimated: 3 min

## Motive types at a glance

- **Biological:** hunger, thirst, temperature regulation, sleep, pain avoidance, sex  
- **Stimulus:** curiosity, play, exploration, novelty seeking  
- **Social/Learned:** achievement, affiliation, power/recognition, autonomy, competence, approval

<!--
Notes:
- Keep this brisk. Do not lecture each item; promise deeper examples shortly.
- Emphasize that social/learned motives are shaped by experience and culture.
- Estimated: 2 min
-->

---

## Biological example: hunger

- **Need:** energy deficit  
- **Drive:** hunger sensations  
- **Response:** seek/eat food  
- **Goal:** restore balance, reduce hunger

Why it matters: timing and cues (smells, time of day) alter when the drive is felt and how strongly it pulls.

<!--
Notes:
- Call out environment: cafeteria cues may “pull” even when need is moderate.
- Quick check: “Drive or incentive—free pizza after lunch?” (Answer: incentive; may amplify weak drive.)
- Estimated: 2 min
-->

---

## Stimulus example: curiosity

- “I clicked because I wanted to see what happens.”  
- Often no deficit, but an arousal target: seeking optimal stimulation or information.

Effects: small bursts of exploration improve learning; too much novelty can fragment attention.

<!--
Notes:
- Give a brief example: opening a new tab during studying.
- Ask: “When does curiosity help you study, and when does it derail you?”
- Estimated: 2 min
-->

---

## Social/learned example: achievement and approval

- Achievement: progress, mastery, standards  
- Approval/affiliation: belonging, recognition

These motives steer choices even when biological drives are met.

<!--
Notes:
- Example: staying late to polish a project despite fatigue (drive vs social incentive conflict).
- Ask for one more real example from the room.
- Estimated: 2 min
-->

---

## Drives and incentives work together

- Hungry + free snacks = strong approach  
- Not hungry + social pull = approach anyway  
- Hungry + no appealing options = delay, substitute, or leave

Behavior is usually **overdetermined**: multiple motives converge.

<!--
Notes:
- Introduce the idea of “overdetermined” gently: many causes push/pull at once.
- Estimated: 1 min
-->

---

## Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation

- **Intrinsic:** doing the activity for its own sake (interest, enjoyment, meaning)  
- **Extrinsic:** doing the activity for a separable outcome (money, points, praise)

Both can be useful, but they behave differently over time.

<!--
Notes:
- Clarify: intrinsic isn’t “better” in all contexts, but it tends to sustain interest without constant rewards.
- Estimated: 2 min
-->

---

## Incentives and interest: two cautions

- Extrinsic incentives can **bootstrap** dull tasks.  
- Heavy, controlling incentives can **undercut** interest in already enjoyable tasks.

The effect depends on task interest and the type of incentive.

<!--
Notes:
- Give a neutral example: paying for reading that was already fun may reduce the desire to read once pay stops.
- Emphasize nuance, not a blanket rule.
- Estimated: 2 min
-->

---

## Goals: why specificity helps

- Specific, meaningful goals focus attention and effort.  
- Feedback shows progress and helps adjust strategies.  
- Vague goals (“do better”) scatter attention.

Example: “Finish problem set #3, questions 1–3, before 9 pm.”

<!--
Notes:
- Invite one student to refactor a vague goal into a specific one, out loud.
- Estimated: 2 min
-->

---

## Expectancy and value

We act when we believe we **can** succeed (**expectancy**) and that it is **worth it** (**value**).

Adjustment levers:  
- Raise expectancy by shrinking the next step, modeling, or scaffolding.  
- Raise value by connecting to near goals, meaning, or consequences.

<!--
Notes:
- Quick oral probe: “If you’re stuck tonight, which lever would help more—expectancy or value?”
- Estimated: 2 min
-->

---

## From goals to action quickly

**Implementation intention**:  
“If it’s [time/cue], then I will [tiny concrete action].”

Example: “If it’s 7:00 pm, then I open the notes and read one page.”

Why it works: reduces initiation friction; links cue to action.

<!--
Notes:
- Encourage students to volunteer one IF–THEN aloud for something low-stakes.
- Estimated: 2 min
-->

---

## Consequences and persistence

Operant ideas that matter for everyday behavior:

- **Reinforcement:** consequences that increase behavior  
- **Punishment:** consequences that decrease behavior  
- **Schedules:** fixed or variable, ratio or interval  
- Variable schedules often produce persistent responding.

<!--
Notes:
- Keep this high-level; avoid schedule taxonomy depth.
- Practical takeaway: occasional, unpredictable small wins can maintain effort.
- Estimated: 3 min
-->

---

## When rewards help vs. hurt

- Help: starting boring/effortful tasks; providing early momentum  
- Hurt: controlling feedback on already enjoyable activities

Better: **informational** feedback (“what improved”) sustains competence without smothering interest.

<!--
Notes:
- Offer contrasting phrases: “You must…” vs “Here’s what you improved…”
- Estimated: 2 min
-->

---

## Wanting versus liking (why habits can stick)

- **Wanting:** cue-triggered drive to obtain (approach)  
- **Liking:** hedonic pleasure of the outcome

They can come apart: you can keep checking your phone without liking the outcome.

Implication: change cues and first steps, not just “willpower.”

<!--
Notes:
- Ask: “Have you ever wanted to do something you didn’t actually enjoy afterward?”
- Estimated: 2 min
-->

---

## Putting it together: quick cases

Case 1: Show-up behavior  
- Drives: fatigue vs hunger  
- Incentives: points, belonging  
- Plan: shrink first step, add cue–action link (IF–THEN)

Case 2: Phone habit during study  
- Incentive history: variable “hits”  
- Adjust: move cue, start with a tiny action, add near value

<!--
Notes:
- Move briskly. For each case, identify one driver, one incentive, one plan tweak.
- Invite the room to label drive vs incentive aloud.
- Estimated: 3 min
-->

---

## Common misconceptions

- “Motivation is just willpower.”  
  Counter: it’s a process with multiple causes.

- “Rewards always help.”  
  Counter: they can bootstrap or backfire depending on interest and type.

- “If I don’t feel motivated, I can’t act.”  
  Counter: plans can lower start cost and let action lead feeling.

<!--
Notes:
- Keep this gentle; focus on usable corrections, not scolding.
- Estimated: 2 min
-->

---

## Quick oral check

- Who can contrast a **drive** and an **incentive** using your own example?  
- Who can run the **Need → Drive → Response → Goal** chain for something you did today?

<!--
Notes:
- Cold-call only if your room is comfortable; otherwise ask for volunteers.
- Aim for two voices; keep it moving.
- Estimated: 2 min
-->

---

## Why this matters for you

- Explains why starting is hard and how to lower friction  
- Shows how cues and small wins sustain effort  
- Helps you choose strategies that fit what’s actually pulling and pushing

<!--
Notes:
- Bridge to next class on Emotion: “Tomorrow we add how it feels and how meaning shapes action.”
- Estimated: 1 min
-->

---

## One-slide takeaway

> **Behavior is usually overdetermined:**  
> internal pushes (drives), external pulls (incentives), and the plans and feedback that shape persistence.

If you change a cue, shrink a step, or adjust a goal, behavior often changes—even if “motivation” feels the same.

<!--
Notes:
- Invite one last question. If none, restate the next meeting’s focus.
- Estimated: 1 min
-->

---
