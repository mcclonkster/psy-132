### Ch. 10 — Motivation & Emotion

#### Describe the need → drive → response → goal model with a personal example.
Motivated activities typically begin with a **need**, which is an internal deficiency [1, 2]. The unmet need leads to a **drive**, which is a state of bodily tension [1, 2]. Drives activate a **response**, which is an action designed to push us toward a **goal** [1, 2]. Reaching the goal satisfies the need, ending the chain of events (Need Reduction) [1, 2].

The simple model of motivation is: **NEED → DRIVE → RESPONSE → GOAL (NEED REDUCTION)** [1].

**Personal Example (Need for Sleep):**
1.  **Need:** For survival, the body requires sleep [3]. After being awake for 18 hours, I experience an internal deficiency of rest [2].
2.  **Drive:** The physical fatigue and tension resulting from this unmet need is sleepiness [1].
3.  **Response:** I complete my nighttime routine, turn off the lights, and lie down in bed [1].
4.  **Goal (Need Reduction):** I fall asleep, satisfying the need for rest and restoring bodily equilibrium (homeostasis) [2, 4].

#### Give examples of biological motives (hunger, thirst, sleep, sex) and one learned motive (achievement, affiliation, power).
**Biological Motives** are based on innate needs essential for survival [3, 5]. The four examples requested are:
1.  **Hunger:** A biological motive arising from the need for food/key nutrients [3, 6].
2.  **Thirst:** A biological motive arising from the need for water, which can be intracellular or extracellular [3, 7].
3.  **Sleep:** An innate need essential for survival [3]. Sleep cycles are influenced by 24-hour biological cycles called circadian rhythms [8, 9].
4.  **Sex:** A biological motive that is unusual because it is largely **non-homeostatic**, meaning it is relatively independent of body need states necessary for individual survival (though necessary for group survival) [10-12].

**Learned Motive (Power):**
*   **Need for Power** is a learned motive, which is often social in nature and based on learned needs, drives, and goals [5, 13, 14]. It is defined as a desire to have impact or control over others [15]. Individuals with a strong need for power often seek visibility, purchasing expensive possessions, wearing prestigious clothes, and exploiting relationships [15].

#### Differentiate intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation; apply SDT (autonomy, competence, relatedness) to a habit you want to change.
**Differentiation:**
*   **Intrinsic motivation** occurs when we engage in a behavior based on **internal rewards** (without obvious external rewards) because we inherently enjoy the activity or see it as an opportunity to learn, explore, and actualize potentials [16-18].
*   **Extrinsic motivation** stems from **factors outside of the person**, such as grades, pay, rewards, obligations, or approval [16, 18, 19].

**Application of Self-Determination Theory (SDT) to a Habit Change:**
Self-determination theory (SDT) proposes that three innate motives are critical: **competence, autonomy, and relatedness** [17, 18, 20].

*   **Habit I want to change:** Shifting from passively watching streaming TV every evening to actively practicing guitar for 30 minutes.

*   **Autonomy (Desire to control one's own life):** To feel autonomous, I would decide which songs or scales to learn each night, rather than adhering to a rigid, externally imposed curriculum. This gives me control over the learning process [20].
*   **Competence (Desire to experience mastery):** I would set small, achievable goals, such as mastering one new chord progression each week. Experiencing this mastery would provide an internal reward, reinforcing my desire to continue the activity [20].
*   **Relatedness (Desire to be connected to others):** I could choose to learn songs to perform for family or friends, or join a casual online community of musicians. This connects the activity to the desire to be connected to and care for other people [20].

#### Set one SMART or WOOP goal and relate arousal to performance (Yerkes–Dodson) for that goal.
The source material does not define or utilize the acronyms SMART or WOOP for goal setting. Therefore, I will define a general goal and apply the relevant motivational theory.

**Goal:** Delivering a **moderately challenging** presentation (e.g., a critical annual report to senior management) [21, 22].

**Arousal and Performance (Yerkes–Dodson Law):**
The relationship between arousal (activation of the body and nervous system) and performance is typically described by the **Yerkes-Dodson law**, which suggests an **inverted-U function** [23, 24].
*   For a moderately challenging task, like giving a presentation, performance is best when the level of arousal is **moderate** [21, 22, 24].
*   If my arousal is too **low** (e.g., I feel bored or sleepy), my performance on the presentation will suffer [23].
*   If my arousal becomes too **high** (e.g., I experience high test anxiety leading to panic or disorganization), my performance will also suffer and drop off, impairing my ability to speak clearly and think on my feet [23, 25].

#### Compare James–Lange, Cannon–Bard, and Two-Factor theories in one sentence each.
*   **James–Lange Theory:** Emotional experience follows bodily arousal and expression; we feel fear *after* we run and notice our physiological reactions [26-28].
*   **Cannon–Bard Theory:** Emotional experience, expression, and physiological arousal occur simultaneously because they are triggered at the same time by activity in the brain's limbic structures [27-29].
*   **Schachter–Singer Two-Factor Theory:** Emotion emerges when we experience general physiological arousal (first factor) and then use cognitive processes (second factor) to label or interpret that arousal based on the situation [27, 30, 31].

#### Identify the four components of emotion (experience, physiology, expression, cognition) in a scenario.
An emotion is characterized by four basic components: experience (subjective feelings), physiology, expression, and cognitions [32, 33].

**Scenario: Winning a demanding competitive sports event.**

*   **Experience:** The subjective feeling of intense happiness, exhilaration, and relief [32, 33].
*   **Physiology:** The body displays sympathetic nervous system activation, such as an increase in heart rate, rapid breathing, and sweating [34-36].
*   **Expression:** I raise my arms in victory (body language/kinesics), shout a vocal burst, and smile widely [32, 36-38].
*   **Cognition:** I attribute the victory to my disciplined training and ability (attribution), and I appraise the result as a confirmation of my mastery (appraisal) [28, 39, 40].

#### Describe a cultural display rule for emotion with an example.
Emotional expression is strongly influenced by cultural ideas, values, and practices [41].

**Cultural Display Rule Example (Expression of Anger):**
In many **Western cultures**, expressing anger is often viewed as a "natural" response to feeling unfairly treated, as the culture values personal independence and the free expression of individual rights [41]. Conversely, in many **Asian cultures**, which place a high value on group harmony, the public expression of anger is less common and is considered unnatural because anger tends to separate people and contradict the cultural emphasis on cooperation [41]. Therefore, an individual from an Asian culture may suppress anger (response modulation/suppression) in a public business setting to maintain group harmony, while an individual from a Western culture might express dissatisfaction more openly [41-43].

#### Describe or practice one emotion-regulation strategy (reappraisal, mindfulness, healthy expression).
I will describe **Cognitive Reappraisal** as an emotion-regulation strategy [43].

**Cognitive Reappraisal** is the strategy of **changing the way you interpret events** that are occurring around you [43, 44]. This technique focuses on altering your emotional appraisal—how you evaluate the personal meaning of a stimulus [39, 44].

**Practice/Example:**
If I receive a harsh review of a project that I worked hard on, my initial emotional appraisal might be that the review is a *threat* and reflects poor personal ability, leading to feelings of anger or sadness [39]. Using cognitive reappraisal, I would reframe this negative event by interpreting it as a *challenge* or an opportunity to practice essential professional skills, such as my ability to listen empathically and incorporate feedback, thus allowing me to avoid negative emotions and potentially increase positive ones [44, 45].

#### Apply motivation/emotion ideas to a real decision or habit you want to change.
**Habit I want to change:** Establishing a consistent routine of vigorous exercise four times a week.

**Motivation Ideas (Intrinsic Focus):**
The primary motivation should shift from extrinsic factors, such as changing physical appearance to gain social approval [13, 16], toward **intrinsic motivation**, such as enjoying the feeling of competence and mastery over my physical body [16, 20]. I would focus on the internal reward of feeling energized and strong after a workout, which is more sustainable than focusing purely on external goals like weight loss or status [15, 16].

**Emotion Ideas (Emotion Regulation):**
To manage the negative emotions (e.g., fatigue or reluctance) associated with starting a workout, I would utilize **redirecting attention** [45]. Instead of focusing on the difficulty of the activity or the time required, I would focus my attention on positive aspects, such as the invigorating music I play or the feeling of accomplishment achieved upon completion [45]. Additionally, I could use **situation selection** by arranging my schedule to work out with an encouraging friend, seeking out situations and people who make me feel happy and motivated [46].

#### Scientific-thinking embed: explain why arousal–performance studies support an inverted-U and what counts as evidence.
Arousal–performance studies, summarized by the **Yerkes–Dodson law**, support an **inverted-U function** because they show that performance is maximized at moderate levels of bodily arousal (activation of the body and nervous system) [23, 24, 47].

The curve is inverted-U shaped because if arousal is too **low** (e.g., boredom or sleepiness), performance suffers due to lack of energy and focus [23, 25]. Conversely, if arousal is too **high** (e.g., extreme test anxiety or panic), performance also declines because the person becomes anxious, emotional, or disorganized [23, 25].

**What Counts as Evidence:**
Evidence for the inverted-U relationship comes from empirical observations and studies that measure changes in performance (e.g., scores, completion rates) across varying levels of arousal [23, 25].
*   One form of evidence is the complexity factor: Studies show that the optimal level of arousal is not static; rather, it depends on the difficulty of the task [24, 25]. For instance, highly difficult and complex tasks (like answering unpredictable questions) show peak performance at **lower** levels of arousal, meaning the optimal point of the inverted-U shifts to the left on the graph [21, 24, 48].
*   Conversely, evidence shows that for very simple, well-practiced tasks (like setting up a projector), high arousal does **not** compromise performance, demonstrating a necessary nuance to the theory [22, 24, 25]. These predictable relationships between measured task complexity, observed performance, and manipulated or reported arousal levels serve as supporting evidence for the Yerkes-Dodson law [21].
