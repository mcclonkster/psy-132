# Emotion  
_PS Y 132 — One-Class Overview_

Today we will:
- Clarify what counts as an emotion (and what doesn’t)
- See how **arousal** and **appraisal** interact
- Compare classic theories with one ongoing example
- Understand regulation options (reappraisal vs suppression)
- Notice culture and norms (display rules)
- Apply it to everyday moments

<!--
Application (inference; no Chapter 10 LO)
Notes: Frame: emotion as a multi-part process coordinating body and action.
-->

---

## What is an emotion?

A coordinated system with **four parts**:
1. **Subjective experience** (feeling)
2. **Physiological arousal** (ANS/endocrine)
3. **Expressive behavior** (face, voice, posture)
4. **Cognitive appraisal** (meaning)

<!--
LO coverage: 10.4.1
Notes: Draw four boxes; emphasize not all parts shift equally in every episode.
-->

---

## Emotion vs mood

- **Emotion:** brief, targeted, coordinated
- **Mood:** longer-lasting, diffuse, less tied to a trigger

<!--
LO coverage: 10.4.2
Notes: Contrast “grumpy all afternoon” vs “pre-talk nerves.”
-->

---

## Arousal ≠ emotion

**Arousal** is body readiness (ANS).  
**Emotion** is arousal + **appraisal** + **action urge**.

Same arousal can be labeled differently and lead to different actions.

<!--
LO coverage: 10.4.3, 10.4.5
Notes: Ask if same heartbeat can feel different; tie to context.
-->

---

## Quick map we will use

**Situation → Arousal + Appraisal → Label → Action urge**

<!--
LO coverage: 10.4.1, 10.4.5
Notes: Keep this diagram simple; reuse it with each example.
-->

---

## Physiology snapshot (signals we see)

- ANS: sympathetic (go) vs parasympathetic (restore)
- Signals: heart rate, skin conductance, respiration, pupils
- Endocrine timing: adrenaline (fast), cortisol (slow)
- Polygraph caution: detects arousal, not truth

<!--
LO coverage: 10.4.3
Notes: Concise and applied; avoid technical rabbit holes.
-->

---

## Ongoing example: public speaking

Same body signs; two appraisals → two labels → two urges

- Threat → **anxiety** → avoid
- Challenge → **excitement** → approach

<!--
Application (inference; no Chapter 10 LO)
Notes: We will reuse this as we compare theories and regulation.
-->

---

## Classic theories (applied)

- **James–Lange:** body → feeling
- **Cannon–Bard:** body and feeling in parallel
- **Two-Factor:** arousal + label from context

<!--
LO coverage: 10.5.1
Notes: Focus on predictions for the same episode, not history.
-->

---

## James–Lange

Notice body changes → experience feeling

Prediction: blocking or misreading feedback changes feeling.

<!--
LO coverage: 10.5.1
Notes: Mention interoception variability.
-->

---

## Cannon–Bard

Central coordination → simultaneous body and feeling

<!--
LO coverage: 10.5.1
Notes: Emphasize simultaneity, not sequence.
-->

---

## Two-Factor

General arousal needs a label from context.  
Change the label → feeling/action can flip, even if arousal stays the same.

<!--
LO coverage: 10.5.1
Notes: This bridges directly to reappraisal.
-->

---

## Basic Emotions (BET/Ekman): strengths and limits

- **BET:** category-like emotions; partly universal expressions
- **Strengths:** recognizability; coding (FACS)
- **Limits:** labels, context, and display rules still shape experience

Use both lenses: recognizability + appraisal.

<!--
LO coverage: 10.5.2
Notes: Balance universals with construction/appraisal; do not litigate the full debate.
-->

---

## How we measure emotion

- Self-report, physiology, expression, behavior
- No channel is perfect; seek convergence

<!--
LO coverage: 10.4.3, 10.4.4
Notes: Polygraphs detect arousal, not truth.
-->

---

## Expression and display rules

- Recognizable expressions across contexts
- **Display rules** (culture/role/status) shape what is shown

Reading faces is informative, not definitive.

<!--
LO coverage: 10.4.4
Notes: Give one context example (work vs home anger displays).
-->

---

## Appraisal in plain language

We tend to ask (fast or slow):
- Can I control this?
- Is success likely?
- Does this matter to me?
- Is this appropriate here?

<!--
LO coverage: 10.4.5
Notes: Apply to speaking example: “I can prepare and do okay” vs “I will bomb.”
-->

---

## Attributions vs appraisals

- **Attributions:** explanations for events (“why this happened”)
- **Appraisals:** evaluations of significance (control, expectancy, value, norms)
- Both shape labels and action urges

<!--
LO coverage: 10.4.5
Notes: Use the speaking example to contrast; keep it concrete.
-->

---

## Same arousal, different labels

- Threat → anxiety → avoid
- Challenge → excitement → approach

<!--
LO coverage: 10.4.5
Notes: Ask for exam or sports example from the room.
-->

---

## Regulation: where to intervene

- Situation selection or modification
- Attentional deployment
- **Cognitive change (reappraisal)**
- Response modulation (**suppression**, breathing, posture)

No single strategy is “best”; context decides.

<!--
LO coverage: 10.4.4
Notes: Keep pragmatic; no silver bullets.
-->

---

## Reappraisal vs suppression

**Reappraisal:** change meaning; often lower cost; needs time/attention.  
**Suppression:** hide/dampen expression; useful briefly; higher cost if overused.

<!--
LO coverage: 10.4.4
Notes: Pragmatic rule: reappraise when possible; suppress briefly when needed, then debrief.
-->

---

## Reappraisal in our example

Old: “danger → I’ll freeze.”  
Reframe: “arousal = energy; clarity over perfection.”  
Shift: anxiety → focused readiness; avoid → approach.

<!--
LO coverage: 10.4.4
Notes: Invite one realistic reframe; avoid sugary phrasing.
-->

---

## Not a cure‑all

- Reappraisal won’t fix no sleep, hostile context, or zero prep
- Suppression isn’t “bad” in short high‑stakes moments
- Mixed strategies are normal

<!--
Application (inference; no Chapter 10 LO)
Notes: Anchor in real life.
-->

---

## Culture and context again

Norms vary; labels are partly learned; differences have reasons.

<!--
LO coverage: 10.4.4
Notes: Tie to appraisal and display rules.
-->

---

## Debate snapshot

- **Basic emotions:** some universal patterns
- **Construction/appraisal:** categories built from arousal + concepts + context
- In practice: labels and norms matter; some patterns repeat

<!--
LO coverage: 10.5.2
Notes: Use both lenses; quick compare, then move on.
-->

---

## Common misconceptions

- “Emotion is just feeling” → coordinated system
- “Calming down” = shutting off emotion → often better labeling/attention
- “Reappraisal is pretending” → truer, more useful frame
- “Suppression is always bad” → situational; short use acceptable

<!--
Application (inference; no Chapter 10 LO)
Notes: Respect folk theories; correct gently.
-->

---

## Quick oral checks

- Two students: same arousal, different labels — give contexts
- One volunteer: when reappraisal or suppression worked and why
- Lightning: threat vs challenge on scenarios

<!--
LO coverage: 10.4.2, 10.4.5, 10.5.1
Notes: Aim for 3–4 quick voices; no writing required.
-->

---

## Why this matters

- Predict action urges and plan ahead
- Work with nerves, anger, disappointment
- Communicate whether arousal, label, or context changed

<!--
Application (inference; no Chapter 10 LO)
Notes: Invite one specific use for the week.
-->

---

## One‑slide takeaway (emotion)

> **Emotion = Arousal + Appraisal + Expression + Experience**  
> Same arousal, different appraisal → different label and action.

<!--
Application (inference; no Chapter 10 LO)
Notes: Bridge back to motivation: adds meaning/steering to the engine.
