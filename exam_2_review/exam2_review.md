## Ch. 2 — Brain & Behavior
- [ ] Identify the major divisions of the nervous system (CNS/PNS; somatic/autonomic; sympathetic/parasympathetic).
- [ ] Label the basic parts of a neuron (dendrites, soma, axon, terminals).
- [ ] Explain, in plain language, how neurons communicate (all-or-none firing; neurotransmitters across synapses).
- [ ] Identify the four cortical lobes and give one everyday function for each.
- [ ] In a short scenario (e.g., pop quiz), describe sympathetic vs. parasympathetic changes.
- [ ] In one sentence, explain how an agonist vs. antagonist alters synaptic transmission.
- [ ] Give a simple example of neuroplasticity (how experience changes the brain).
- [ ] Name one brain-research method (e.g., EEG, fMRI) and what it tells us.
- [ ] Apply the biopsychosocial model to explain a behavior (e.g., test anxiety).
- [ ] Describe or practice one self-regulation strategy (focus, stress management).
- [ ] Scientific-thinking embed: state what EEG vs. fMRI can and cannot claim (correlation ≠ causation).

## Ch. 6 — Conditioning & Learning
- [ ] Match UCS, UCR, CS, CR to a simple classical-conditioning scenario.
- [ ] Explain how a phobia or advertisement could be classically conditioned.
- [ ] Distinguish reinforcement vs. punishment (positive/negative) with everyday examples.
- [ ] Describe shaping (reinforcing small steps toward a behavior).
- [ ] Give one example each of generalization, discrimination, and extinction.
- [ ] Explain observational learning (modeling) with a real example (e.g., media, family).
- [ ] Note one ethical guideline when choosing punishment vs. reinforcement in applied settings.
- [ ] Apply a simple self-management plan (token/points, goal setting, habit tracking).
- [ ] Scientific-thinking embed: for a media/violence headline, identify the design (experiment, correlational, quasi-) and a key limit.

## Ch. 7 — Memory
- [ ] Distinguish sensory, short-term/working, and long-term memory.
- [ ] Describe encoding, storage, and retrieval in everyday terms.
- [ ] Explain why working memory is limited and how chunking helps.
- [ ] Identify common memory errors (false memories, eyewitness mistakes) and why memory is reconstructive.
- [ ] Explain why spacing beats cramming and also use retrieval practice and interleaving; avoid illusions of fluency from rereading.
- [ ] Apply encoding specificity (context/state dependence) to a study plan.
- [ ] Identify a source monitoring error in a real example.
- [ ] Use at least one memory strategy (mnemonics, chunking, imagery, rehearsal).
- [ ] Describe the serial position effect (primacy/recency) with an example.
- [ ] Note one change you’ll make to your study/memory habits.
- [ ] Scientific-thinking embed: read a simple graph (e.g., forgetting curve or serial-position) and state the main claim in one sentence.

## Ch. 8 — Cognition, Language, & Creativity
- [ ] Define cognition and give a daily-life example (problem solving, decisions).
- [ ] Spot a problem-solving barrier (functional fixedness, mental set) in an example.
- [ ] Recognize a decision-making bias (confirmation bias, availability heuristic) and correct for it.
- [ ] Apply the dual-process idea (fast/automatic vs. slow/analytic) to one decision.
- [ ] Recognize a framing or loss-aversion/sunk-cost example in daily life.
- [ ] Identify basic language elements (phonemes, morphemes, syntax, semantics) in simple terms.
- [ ] Distinguish convergent vs. divergent thinking with examples.
- [ ] Give one culture/language example that shapes cognition or expression.
- [ ] Try one creativity strategy (brainstorming, reframing, multiple perspectives).
- [ ] Scientific-thinking embed: provide an operational definition for a bias or a creativity measure used in class.

## Ch. 10 — Motivation & Emotion
- [ ] Describe the need → drive → response → goal model with a personal example.
- [ ] Give examples of biological motives (hunger, thirst, sleep, sex) and one learned motive (achievement, affiliation, power).
- [ ] Differentiate intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation; apply SDT (autonomy, competence, relatedness) to a habit you want to change.
- [ ] Set one SMART or WOOP goal and relate arousal to performance (Yerkes–Dodson) for that goal.
- [ ] Compare James–Lange, Cannon–Bard, and Two-Factor theories in one sentence each.
- [ ] Identify the four components of emotion (experience, physiology, expression, cognition) in a scenario.
- [ ] Describe a cultural display rule for emotion with an example.
- [ ] Describe or practice one emotion-regulation strategy (reappraisal, mindfulness, healthy expression).
- [ ] Apply motivation/emotion ideas to a real decision or habit you want to change.
- [ ] Scientific-thinking embed: explain why arousal–performance studies support an inverted-U and what counts as evidence.
